It has now been *37 days* since the House passed emergency aid to states.  Mcconnell refuses to enact it because he and trump don’t care if your state goes bankrupt fighting covid.  Over 45000000 are out of work and republicans want to make that number higher. https://t.co/5lbVhBJaak,2020-06-21 15:33:30,Twitter for iPhone,44,78,covid;

In case anyone forgets it's now been *31 days* since the House passed a 2nd round of stimulus checks to Americans.   Covid remains and the economy is teetering but the do-nothing mcconnell senate refuses to enact them bc it's doing crap like investigating the Obama government. https://t.co/WUf4P7xWLu,2020-06-15 13:15:08,Twitter Web App,39,73,covid;

Nursing homes remain the most vulnerable targets for covid19 which is precisely why so many of us in Congress today besieged the administration to prioritize more assistance to long-term care facilities. https://t.co/aSkOL1VpeK,2020-06-05 17:14:37,Twitter Web App,6,8,covid; 
Donald trump is an arsonist and the United States itself is his target. If he were trying to harm Americans and make America weaker what would he do differently?

Our state is being bled into bankruptcy fighting covid.  *14 days ago* the House passed an emergency $16.6B to #NJ and more to other states to shoulder their covid burdens.

Let me reiterate this morning: there are no miracle treatments for covid.

One of the nation’s leading vaccine experts was removed for not promoting unproven drugs and alleges the covid response is riddled with graft incompetence and outright corruption.

Last week @SenatorMenendez and I called for a federal investigation into the administration’s politicization of drug approvals to fight covid.

Trump’s vile attacks on honest experts is the fruit of decades of republican attacks to destroy the civil service &amp; enable corruption.   Failures to meet the covid challenge are part a product of the gop’s vandalism against functional govt.

I’ve now twice called on Powell and the Federal Reserve to broadly purchase municipal debts. Local govts cannot be forced into fighting covid now to face brutal budget cuts later. The Fed must step in. https://t.co/Cc1EnovmDK,2020-04-21 13:34:28,Twitter for iPhone,10,14,covid; 
With states barely above water fighting covid the Fed needs to pitch in. Powell has taken steps to buy municipal debts but opening the program to just 10 big cities + 16 counties isn’t enough. The Fed needs to go much further ASAP. Let’s see it. https://t.co/LF6SETHrsG,2020-04-21 13:20:35,Twitter for iPhone,6,20,covid; 
"The White House pledged over 2 weeks ago to cover coronavirus treatment for uninsured Americans but the administration still doesn't have a plan for how to do it."
