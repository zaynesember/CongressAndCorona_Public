I’ve heard from #VA10 federal workers and contractors who are frustrated at the limited guidance they've been given regarding #COVID19 telework policies and concerned for their families' health.

We’ve been urging the President to marshal the resources of the federal government by invoking the Defense Production Act—today he announced that he would.
