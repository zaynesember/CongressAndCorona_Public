I joined Sully Dems' virtual meeting last night to thank some of our incredible #TeamWexton volunteers!  COVID made this a campaign unlike any other and we couldn't have done it without the heart and hard work of volunteers across #VA10. https://t.co/enkFlHAf5e,2020-11-16 19:12:39,Twitter for Android,1,19,covid; 
Next stop: Berryville with @WendyGooditisVA! 🗺️  I love hearing why #VA10 voters are out here today—from health care to gun violence prevention to getting control of #COVID19 and so much more.  It's all on the ballot this year so make a plan to cast yours before 7 p.m. 🗳️ https://t.co/4eVWbcRQ6v,2020-11-03 13:54:32,Twitter for Android,9,43,covid; 
I had a terrific afternoon visiting Leesburg's small businesses and talking to voters with Mayor Kelly Burk!  Hearing directly from #VA10's small business owners has been invaluable as I continue to fight to help our district weather #COVID19. https://t.co/vuvPiD93I3,2020-11-01 22:20:57,Twitter for Android,5,45,covid; 
We're working hard to get to an agreement on another #COVID19 deal—but all we're getting from @senatemajldr is sabotage.  Leader McConnell it's time to put politics aside and do what's right for American families. https://t.co/asbSp4ejYL,2020-10-20 20:39:42,Twitter for Android,14,50,covid; 
I've had our small business owners' backs throughout the #COVID19 crisis.   Thanks to the #CARESAct more than 18800 #VA10 businesses received federal support and I've been all across our district touring mom and pop shops to hear what more needs to be done. #VA10Debate https://t.co/nqb4vahjXY,2020-10-15 13:00:58,Twitter for Android,7,15,covid; 
When a gun is present in a domestic violence situation a victim is 5x more likely to die.  DV incidents are on the rise during #COVID19 and anybody—no matter how famous or connected—can be a victim.  If you need help please call 1-800-799-7233. It could save your life. https://t.co/1Jp3YnXaXv,2020-09-29 00:33:41,Twitter for Android,135,315,covid; 
“My dad was a healthy 65-year-old. His only preexisting condition was trusting Donald Trump and for that he paid with his life."  Thank you Kristin Urquiza for sharing your father's story and why electing @JoeBiden means a serious plan to tackle #COVID19.,2020-08-18 01:59:14,Twitter for Android,30,121,covid; 
Glad I could join @C_Herring @JennMcClellanVA @Broder512 &amp; Joyce for today's #TeamJoe Build Back Better Roundtable!  #COVID19 has exposed our broken caregiving system and @JoeBiden has a plan to fix it creating new jobs &amp; supporting Virginia families.  Let's win in November. https://t.co/MBZSS5RMgg,2020-07-23 23:20:25,Twitter for Android,12,21,covid; 
More than 130000 Americans have died from coronavirus.   Do your job. https://t.co/rqEFr0i6hm,2020-07-06 18:57:40,Twitter for iPhone,35,218,corona; 
A stunning indictment on the President's failure to take #COVID19 seriously—costing lives and doing unprecedented damage to our economy.  It didn't have to be this way. https://t.co/EgNbg2EI2r,2020-06-23 19:04:22,Twitter for iPhone,8,37,covid; 
We're on the verge of another grim milestone—nearly 100000 Americans lost to #COVID19.  And today the President is visiting my district. Not to deliver #PPE or announce expanded testing.  But to go golfing.   A total absence of leadership in crisis. https://t.co/tVGeRU0j7N,2020-05-23 15:51:09,Twitter for iPhone,138,399,covid;

I appreciated hearing from #VA10 labor leaders yesterday about the concerns of workers on the frontlines of #COVID19.  I have your back in Congress and will continue fighting for better protections for everyone keeping us safe and our communities up and running. https://t.co/5NBqBi1SQw,2020-04-15 17:00:49,Twitter for Android,14,45,covid; 
These numbers are sobering for anyone. No one is immune to this virus and we all know someone who is especially vulnerable.  We all need to take this seriously and do our part to slow the spread of #COVID19.  Please #StayHome. This is about saving lives. https://t.co/Dj7iFOKfgj,2020-03-31 23:49:44,Twitter for iPhone,20,78,covid; 
I'm having serious trouble understanding what's so controversial about: ▶️Free testing for #COVID19 ▶️Paid sick leave ▶️Food security for our kids ▶️Enhanced unemployment insurance  What's the hold up @realDonaldTrump?   We can’t afford to wait—we need to put #FamiliesFirst.,2020-03-14 00:36:21,Twitter for iPhone,28,129,covid; 
The lack of testing capacity is severely undermining our ability to prevent the spread of coronavirus—and the President didn't even bother to address it.  Where are the tests Mr. President? Every American deserves to know.   Lives are at stake.,2020-03-12 02:11:49,Twitter for iPhone,61,224,corona; 
Important PSA: coronavirus has absolutely nothing to do with race nationality or ethnicity and the xenophobia and misinformation being spread to suggest otherwise is harmful and dangerous.  It's important we spread facts—not fear—about this serious public health threat.,2020-03-12 00:45:04,Twitter for Android,122,377,corona;
