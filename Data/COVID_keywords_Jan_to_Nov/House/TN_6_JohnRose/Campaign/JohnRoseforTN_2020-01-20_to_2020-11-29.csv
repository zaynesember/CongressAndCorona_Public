The Communist Chinese regime destroyed valuable data silenced doctors and blocked an investigation into the origin of #COVID19. They are responsible for this pandemic and we must continue to hold them accountable. https://t.co/lbRNMCSoUi,2020-11-22 19:40:21,Twitter Web App,628,613,covid; 
Communist China hid and destroyed evidence regarding #COVID19. We must continue to hold them accountable. That’s exactly what President @realDonaldTrump and Vice Pres. @Mike_Pence are doing. #KAG2020 #VPDebate #MAGA,2020-10-08 01:49:38,Twitter Web App,1,7,covid; 
President @realDonaldTrump &amp; Vice President @Mike_Pence did the right thing by banning travel from China early on. The Trump Administration has taken decisive action towards defeating the invisible enemy #COVID19. #MAGA #VPDebate,2020-10-08 01:11:11,Twitter Web App,2,5,covid;
