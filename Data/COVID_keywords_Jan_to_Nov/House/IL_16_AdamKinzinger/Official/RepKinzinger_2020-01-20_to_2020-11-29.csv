1) Covid is real hospitals are overwhelmed.  2) Chemtrails are NOT real.  3) Wearing a mask protects others from you.  4) Wearing pants protects others from having to see you without them.  5) Neither are secret plans to control you.,2020-11-21 23:02:48,Twitter for iPhone,1028,6040,covid; 
Just spoke with folks at Morris Hospital and the spike of #coronavirus cases is beyond alarming. Many hospitals are already at capacity so please use precautions and be safe. #IL16 https://t.co/TRo20E1QEM,2020-11-19 21:16:50,Twitter for iPhone,21,152,corona; 
Dear New Congress-members:  if you work out cool.  Please don’t find an excuse to post your entire workout video.    Also Covid is real. https://t.co/iurRXCJvXi,2020-11-14 15:16:33,Twitter for iPhone,811,9132,covid;

Reminder: the coronavirus pandemic continues to spike here in #Illinois &amp; across the country. In #IL16 counties the number of confirmed #COVID19 cases reached 25k in just six weeks. ‼️ Stay vigilant and stay safe. https://t.co/dxRFh6PfS0,2020-11-06 18:42:57,Twitter for iPhone,29,245,covid; corona; 
It's our duty to come together &amp; address the urgent needs of those impacted by #COVID19. We've done so many times w/ bipartisan effort. But tonight @SpeakerPelosi chose politics over the American people. I’m disappointed &amp; I’m sure I’m not alone in that. https://t.co/9E2LYD0jKG,2020-10-02 01:02:29,Twitter Web App,25,70,covid; 
It's officially #BackToSchool season &amp; my office has restarted our internship program for the fall semester.   As we all continue to adjust to the challenges of #COVID19 I'm grateful to have our interns--like Tyler here from #IL16--making the most of this remote internship. 👍 https://t.co/9looWHvctA,2020-09-09 21:43:10,Twitter for iPhone,4,62,covid; 
During this #COVID19 pandemic getting outside has never felt so important to our daily lives &amp; mental health. Our bipartisan efforts to invest in our public lands is critical &amp; long overdue. America is a beautiful country so let’s take care of her. https://t.co/CsiTq0JcXv,2020-07-31 16:20:29,Twitter for iPhone,12,91,covid; 
Last month Congress passed legislation to extend the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). There's currently $122B left in the fund so if you're in need of this forgivable loan due to #COVID19 visit @SBAgov for more information: https://t.co/6FZQFwc4HK https://t.co/vj4VonPQIG,2020-07-21 16:37:24,Twitter for iPhone,37,53,covid; 
Had a great time this morning visiting @CrusaderHealth in #IL16 hearing about how they‘ve adjusted so seamlessly to the challenges of #COVID19 &amp; utilized tele-health to better serve patients in our community.

The Communist Party of China has used the #COVID19 pandemic to undermine the whole world &amp; that includes their own people. Reneging their promises to Hong Kong &amp; crushing any chance of independence is how the #CCP authoritarianism works &amp; it's about time we recognize it.,2020-05-27 15:39:57,Twitter Web App,88,212,covid; 
As we continue to fight through the #coronavirus we cannot forget the struggles millions of Americans continue to face with #opioid abuse &amp; misuse.

We need leadership on how to live AND work in this new normal. @MayoClinic says face masks reduce #COVID19 spread by 50-80% ‼️ Wearing a mask isn’t for you—it protects others from you.  Wearing a mask isn’t about stifling your freedom—it’s about saving lives AND our economy.,2020-05-18 15:19:33,Twitter Web App,141,606,covid; 
This is unacceptable. The Communist Party of China continues to put American lives at risk as they try to capitalize on the #COVID19 pandemic.  With their faulty manufacturing &amp; increased cyber attacks the US needs to hold #China accountable &amp; address their threats head on. https://t.co/Y2y5kbUAIO,2020-05-13 15:11:20,Twitter Web App,28,100,covid; 
To the nurses of #IL16 and all across the country THANK YOU. #ThankYouNurses for the life-saving work you do every single day for the compassion you show to our loved ones for serving on the frontlines of the #COVID19 pandemic. #NationalNursesDay,2020-05-06 19:31:42,Twitter for iPhone,6,64,covid; 
Many counties across #Illinois continue to report zero cases of #COVID19. As we continue to address areas where numbers are high @GovPritzker must step up &amp; take a regional approach to create a safe reopening plan that balances safety AND employment. https://t.co/1HjxD7qf8x https://t.co/7J6XjRPPu5,2020-04-30 18:38:22,Twitter for iPhone,43,170,covid; 
This #WorldImmunizationWeek reminds us that we must do more to ensure all people have access to vaccines. The #coronavirus has shown that diseases cross borders &amp; affect everyone.

Social media is such an important part of our lives especially now with #COVID19. But misinformation &amp; fraudulent activity have become real problems.

When the Chinese gov’t tells me they “implemented control measures” does that include the control of information; shutting out reporters &amp; silencing doctors? As the rest of the world works to fight this pandemic China needs to come clean &amp; be honest about the #coronavirus. https://t.co/z8KJRC9WqJ,2020-04-20 17:24:40,Twitter for iPhone,781,907,corona;

The Senate must act on the #CARESAct now. This is not the time for political posturing. This is a time for action.

The spread of the #coronavirus is very serious and it needs to be contained.
