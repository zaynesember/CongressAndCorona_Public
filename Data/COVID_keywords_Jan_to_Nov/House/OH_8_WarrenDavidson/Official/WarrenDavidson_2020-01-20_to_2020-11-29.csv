The 8th District is home to so many great small businesses that I always enjoy visiting. Clearly Ohio’s response to COVID has hit small businesses especially hard this year.

Statistics never rival personal tragedies. We should all be mindful that more than 236000 Americans have died w/ #COVID19. We should also fight the battle we’re actually in; not the one many originally feared (+2-million deaths) or the one that we all hoped for (already gone).,2020-11-06 23:43:33,Twitter for iPhone,3,18,covid; 
A reminder... According to CDC if you happen to get #COVID19 the survival rate by age is overwhelming: 0-19 99.997% 20-49 99.9% 50-69 99.5% +70 94.6% The fatality risk is heavily tied to  comorbidities which is a major factor in the +70 year old data.,2020-11-06 21:13:44,Twitter for iPhone,101,267,covid; 
#FactsMatter It is long overdue for governors and public health officials to fight the battle we’re actually in rather than the wildly inaccurate #COVID19 projections.
