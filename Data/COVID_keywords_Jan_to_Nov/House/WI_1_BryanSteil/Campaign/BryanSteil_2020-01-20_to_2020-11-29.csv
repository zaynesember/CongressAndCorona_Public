The Kennedy Center should not be receiving $25 million in taxpayer funding while simultaneously laying off hundreds of workers.   My bill takes the money back. That money should be focused on coronavirus relief efforts. https://t.co/uGFZWCIfvK,2020-04-01 13:32:50,Twitter for iPhone,10,18,corona; 
@ScottWalker The $25 million in funding should go to fighting coronavirus!,2020-03-31 17:05:02,Twitter for iPhone,3,7,corona; 
$25 million for the Kennedy Center shouldn’t have been included in the coronavirus relief package.  Funding a D.C. theater has nothing to do with combatting the coronavirus.  My bill would take back the $25 million. Thanks @SteveScalise for your support.  https://t.co/3n3qtDqRPr,2020-03-31 15:53:39,Twitter for iPhone,19,53,corona;

The relief package we passed ensures health care professionals have the funding they need to combat the Coronavirus while also protecting American workers’ paychecks.  The legislation is far from perfect but swift action was necessary to provide support for American families.,2020-03-30 15:31:43,Twitter for iPhone,6,22,corona;
