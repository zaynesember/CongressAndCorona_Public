America receives results under @realDonaldTrump.  Our economy grew 33.1% this quarter which is 2/3 of the GDP lost due to COVID-19.  It took us one quarter for this growth - but it took Joe Biden four full years for his so-called economic “recovery.”,2020-10-29 14:33:22,Twitter for iPhone,6,13,covid; 
Despite heavy headwinds created by the Democrats @realDonaldTrump has reignited the economy as nearly 12 million jobs have been added back in the last 5 months and 40% of jobs lost to COVID-19 have been recreated.

Liberal governors like Roy Cooper have exploited the COVID-19 crisis from the very beginning and are now forcing us to relocate the #RNCConvention.  NC might be closed but Florida is open for business and ready to renominate @realDonaldTrump!  https://t.co/qH0NInvdsM,2020-06-04 17:28:26,Twitter Web App,6,9,covid; 
When the history of the 2020 COVID Pandemic is written Florida's response and recovery will be seen as a success story. Democrat-led New York and Michigan? Not so much...  https://t.co/spGL1ofLVe,2020-05-30 18:35:00,TweetDeck,3,9,covid; 
I encourage you to read this piece on how Florida’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic should earn our state praises from the entire country – especially the corrupt politicians and fake news media based out of New Jersey and New York  https://t.co/C98pHYpSCs,2020-05-21 21:37:44,Twitter Web App,5,11,covid; 
While I have respect for scientists like Dr. Fauci I agree with Senator Rand Paul that  we’re allowing the opinions of one individual to carry far too much weight in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  https://t.co/rTAmbw2q4g,2020-05-14 20:50:33,TweetDeck,100,145,covid; 
It’s becoming increasingly clear by the day that China must be held accountable for allowing COVID-19 to escape its border.  https://t.co/yBw1grwMr1,2020-05-05 21:29:07,Twitter Web App,792,840,covid; 
I agree with the conclusions of the article’s authors. If the global COVID-19 pandemic has taught us anything it’s that we can no longer afford to rely on China and other adversaries to control a majority of our health care supply chain.  https://t.co/ePfGmnVect,2020-04-29 21:31:15,TweetDeck,7,15,covid; 
The World Health Organization has been a mouthpiece for China during the coronavirus pandemic. Both the WHO and China must face consequences once this pandemic is under control. https://t.co/FeshNFgjps,2020-03-24 15:10:48,Twitter for iPhone,1091,1311,corona;
