On this edition of "Local with Lauren" I sit down with local farmers to discuss the impacts that COVID is having on our farming community: https://t.co/hSze0Te0HR,2020-10-27 16:56:05,Twitter Media Studio,45,175,covid; 
With COVID-19 causing more and more Illinoisans to develop pre-existing conditions a Supreme Court repeal of the Affordable Care Act would devastate our community. Health care is on the ballot - and the choice is clear. #Election2020  https://t.co/YFpJwGo3aH,2020-10-16 22:52:53,TweetDeck,59,109,covid;

Now is the time to unite as a community. I want to wish the President the First Lady and those around them a swift and comfortable recovery from COVID-19. This is a difficult time for all of us: let's all work together to stop the spread.,2020-10-03 21:01:10,TweetDeck,32,334,covid; 
Last week we crossed a line we hoped we never would: 200000 Americans have died from COVID-19. This didn’t have to happen. A competent administration would not have let it happen. And now families across our state &amp; country have a hole in their hearts that can never be filled.,2020-09-29 17:08:39,TweetDeck,56,192,covid; 
#COVID has changed how we campaign but Team Underwood is making it work. I'm visiting porches across the 7 counties of #IL14 for socially distant conversations with constituents and taking q's over Zoom! 😷 https://t.co/uMa9w7kuPb,2020-08-28 22:27:46,TweetDeck,84,470,covid; socially distant; 
While we continue to fight COVID we need to make certain that we're all protected from preventable illnesses. I was proud to introduce a plan to boost vaccine rates &amp; begin preparations for the distribution of a COVID vaccine. https://t.co/Q370tXugds,2020-08-22 22:45:00,TweetDeck,86,303,covid; 
Our country has been facing a Black maternal mortality crisis for decades &amp; the coronavirus is only making it worse. I am proud to work w/ @ewarren to tackle this crisis head-on by collecting data &amp; making critical investments to improve health outcomes:  https://t.co/3tBcOQhFUU,2020-08-21 20:52:32,TweetDeck,80,262,corona; 
Even before the coronavirus pandemic affordable child care services too often remained out of reach for folks. I was proud to lead on legislation that would provide assistance to child care providers:  https://t.co/Or20XcNbFw,2020-08-20 15:39:03,TweetDeck,113,356,corona; 
We have a shortage of public health workers in #IL14 &amp; across the US. That's why I introduced legislation to recruit train and employ Americans to expand our public health workforce. We need a Health Force to fight COVID-19 and put Americans back to work. https://t.co/7ZLqzsJqfs,2020-08-10 23:12:56,TweetDeck,65,177,covid; 
Misinformation is adding fuel to the fire of the COVID-19 pandemic. I introduced the Protecting Against Public Safety Disinformation Act to strengthen our resiliency to deepfakes manipulated media and online bots during this public health crisis.  https://t.co/9xBFp6arNh,2020-08-08 15:55:14,TweetDeck,73,246,covid; 
The House passed a second COVID relief bill ten weeks ago.   Unemployment benefits for families who have lost work due to COVID are set to expire Friday.   I am fighting for our families.  https://t.co/YrRwcpkVz3,2020-07-29 21:06:21,TweetDeck,137,456,covid; 
“COVID-19 is a science-based problem. It can be mitigated with testing vaccine development and public acceptance and awareness.”   I agree Rocco -- that’s why I’ve been fighting for consistent evidence-backed data-driven policy since day one.  https://t.co/evxQUUYe2M,2020-07-27 21:26:00,TweetDeck,39,99,covid; 
Late last night in the midst of the #COVID19 pandemic with millions out of work the Trump Administration asked the Supreme Court to invalidate the healthcare coverage of 23 million Americans. This is cowardly unacceptable &amp; dangerous.   https://t.co/JjXP6U46Gl,2020-06-26 18:13:31,TweetDeck,63,145,covid; 
👋🏿 So excited.   Thank you @harpersbazaarus and @CTurlington for the opportunity to discuss what gives me hope: fighting maternal mortality disparities our continued work to end racism in our country and our response to #COVID19. https://t.co/ERME0d0Yxj,2020-06-24 17:56:18,TweetDeck,84,317,covid; 
I didn’t expect a global pandemic to occur in my first term in Congress but I’m honored to be using my experience as a nurse and public health expert to work to stop the spread of #COVID-19. https://t.co/znk6HET0Jt,2020-06-23 18:45:00,TweetDeck,1108,4652,covid; 
I’ll be heading back to DC this week to secure funding for our district to carry us through this pandemic. The #HeroesAct provides funding for local governments to respond adequately to #COVID19 premium pay for essential workers &amp; increased funding to support small businesses. https://t.co/hl19kg44Zi,2020-05-14 00:41:43,TweetDeck,32,117,covid; 
Re-opening our economy is top of mind for many of us myself included -- let’s break down how we’ll safely re-open our economy:  ✅Widespread testing ✅A sustained decrease in cases ✅Widely available care for #COVID19 patients https://t.co/RdNxXmfCMv,2020-04-29 21:29:48,Twitter Media Studio,59,164,covid; 
Nurses &amp; doctors are doing heroic work for our communities. It's outrageous that while they're saving lives they don’t have proper PPE. We have to have their back: that means ensuring they have the needed PPE &amp; that every American who needs a #COVID19 test can get one quickly. https://t.co/7SN9vCSxrR,2020-04-24 19:14:56,TweetDeck,61,235,covid; 
Before #COVID19 became a pandemic we had millions of Americans that were uninsured in our country. And we’re seeing the consequences of that right now. https://t.co/O4ThruEzY8,2020-04-18 23:03:35,Twitter Web App,157,477,covid; 
To protect against disparities we see with #COVID19 we must make significant investments in biomedical research lowering premium costs affordable prescriptions training more health providers &amp; expanding Medicaid. These are necessary to save lives. https://t.co/uVMi9lROhY,2020-04-17 21:44:04,TweetDeck,122,421,covid; 
In Illinois African Americans are 5x more likely to die from COVID-19. We can’t assume people will come to a healthcare system where there may be mistrust or long-standing barriers &amp; expect positive outcomes. We must meet people where they are &amp; provide quality affordable care. https://t.co/Qx6VGtzG9Q,2020-04-15 22:30:00,TweetDeck,60,206,covid; 
Thank you to @PPAct for your support of our #MOMnibus bill! It’s so important we have the resources and funding to combat disparities in maternal health especially as we face #COVID19. #BlackMaternalHealthWeek   https://t.co/52Pg3Pxu7L,2020-04-14 22:02:11,Twitter Web App,17,42,covid; 
The US Postal Service plays a critical role in our communities and postal workers are heroic essential workers during this COVID-19 crisis. Thank you mail carriers &amp; postal workers. I will continue to work to support you! https://t.co/MqQm243SlU,2020-04-14 16:30:00,TweetDeck,77,255,covid; 
We will not be able to fully reopen our economy until the American public’s health is assured.  This means wide-spread affordable #COVID19 testing and a significant reduction of new cases. https://t.co/zymCbdjlL8,2020-04-14 00:48:53,Twitter Web App,95,425,covid; 
Millions of uninsured workers are facing the possibility of coronavirus and devastating health care bills &amp; they need an option for affordable care. There must be a nationwide special enrollment period for people to receive the affordable care they need. https://t.co/86pQtAMgPJ,2020-04-07 17:38:28,TweetDeck,39,71,corona; 
Testing for #COVID19 is free to all patients but treatment isn’t covered for everyone. We must work to ensure American patients don’t have to pay out of pocket for COVID-19 treatment and that health care is affordable and accessible. https://t.co/UVGN0GTsJ4,2020-04-04 22:55:30,TweetDeck,40,134,covid; 
Protecting healthcare workers from #COVID19 starts with access to personal protective equipment. The Strategic National Stockpile is running low &amp; hospitals are facing a shortage of PPE. We need the President to activate the #DefenseProductionActNow.   https://t.co/L94NOoSKAQ,2020-04-03 01:30:00,TweetDeck,64,149,covid; 
Healthcare &amp; essential workers are on the frontlines of the COVID19 pandemic &amp; it’s critical that they have personal protective equipment. The President must activate the #DefenseProductionAct to get PPE distributed to where it's needed most: into the hands of healthcare workers. https://t.co/EdlRlmdVfg,2020-03-31 23:53:47,Twitter Web App,126,364,covid; 
Because of the public health crisis we’re facing removing cost barriers for care is more critical than ever. We must lower the costs for healthcare and give relief to those who are being treated for #COVID19.,2020-03-31 01:37:13,TweetDeck,82,393,covid;
