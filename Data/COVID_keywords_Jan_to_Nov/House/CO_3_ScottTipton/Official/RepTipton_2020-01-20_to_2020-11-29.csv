Post-COVID recovery for rural CO healthcare is hard.  #PublicOption makes it even harder.  Expensive one size fits all big government plan isn't what rural Coloradans need! Great column in the Sun today by the Colorado Business Roundtable’s Debbie Brown: https://t.co/aP3rL0Vrkp,2020-09-25 21:05:56,Twitter for iPhone,2,5,covid; 
It's been three months since the CARES Act was signed into law. We understood then just as we do now that there would be necessary changes and tweaks along the way but already this critical legislation has helped and will continue to help millions of Americans battle COVID-19.,2020-06-30 16:32:51,Twitter Web App,3,1,covid; 
The #CCP hid what it knew about the initial outbreak of COVID-19 and is now hiding information about its nuclear ambitions. The U.S. must reign in China through effective arms control. https://t.co/hmcgnoJagz,2020-06-16 19:32:33,Twitter Web App,714,745,covid; 
Economic recovery from COVID-19 is going to be dependent on maintaining existing jobs such as the roughly 1590 steel jobs in CO's 3rd. I will continue to fight for steel workers who are critical to our nation’s infrastructure and national security. https://t.co/Mzs0DMzw1u,2020-06-02 18:57:59,Twitter Web App,3,2,covid; 
Approximately 90k good-paying jobs exist in Colorado's oil and gas industry but COVID-19 alongside Russia &amp; Saudi Arabia flooding markets has threatened these workers and their families' livelihoods.

Should the #CCP fail to cooperate with the U.S. or its allies on investigations into the regime's failed handling of the initial COVID-19 outbreak there will be severe consequences. The CCP will be held accountable—America will lead that charge.  https://t.co/kWQYk1f7Tb,2020-05-15 16:05:03,Twitter Web App,827,861,covid; 
Over 1000 Coloradans have lost their fight against COVID-19. Each of them has a name and family and friends who loved them.   Tomorrow Coloradans will unite by wearing a mask as a symbol that we will do our part to protect others &amp; observe a minute of silence @ 7pm https://t.co/4vrRM6kwZY,2020-05-14 19:16:48,Twitter Web App,2,4,covid; 
We all know the best path to economically recover from COVID19 is to safely reopen businesses where the caseload is low and decreasing. @POTUS and his Administration have been incredibly responsive to our calls to address Colorado's most dire needs throughout this pandemic.,2020-05-13 16:51:15,Twitter Web App,2,7,covid; 
Evidence of #CCP's mishandling of the COVID-19 outbreak continues to pile up. After years of blatant human-rights abuses stealing of American intellectual property and manipulation of markets we must hold the CCP accountable! https://t.co/PSLSnBDIa7,2020-05-13 15:49:00,Twitter Web App,74,85,covid; 
In the midst of a public health crisis we are receiving reports of the #CCP attempting to steal critical information on American COVID-19 vaccination research.

The COVID-19 pandemic is again reinforcing the importance of responsible U.S. mineral development.

Rumors that Gov. Polis plans to use money from the CARES Act to backfill state budget shortfalls are deeply concerning. This money is intended to help rural and underserved communities during the COVID-19 outbreak and should not be used for anything else!  https://t.co/0bsw1JNzg5,2020-04-17 19:53:03,Twitter Web App,34,52,covid;

On Sunday when a bipartisan deal was close to the finish line Colorado had 591 cases of COVID-19.  The count has since surpassed 700.   We are wasting time and putting lives at risk.
