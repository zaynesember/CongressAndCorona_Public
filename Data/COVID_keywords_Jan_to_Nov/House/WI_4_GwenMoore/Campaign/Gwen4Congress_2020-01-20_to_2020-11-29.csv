The President hasn’t attended a #coronavirus task force meeting in at least 5 months.   The health and safety of American families has never been a priority of this administration.   Completely irresponsible.   https://t.co/sYDZOibMff,2020-11-15 16:59:00,Twitter for iPhone,1,7,corona; 
Let's be clear:   Trump doesn’t care about you. He doesn’t even care about his own supporters.  Latest @Stanford study estimates that 18 Trump rallies have led to 30000 #COVID19 cases and 700 deaths.

Wisconsin experienced 5262 new COVID cases today.  64 new deaths.  31.8% positivity rate—meaning almost 1 in 3 people tested tested positive.  Meanwhile Trump is actively working to take healthcare away from millions of Americans.   We must vote!  https://t.co/vc4vQ5cRt2 https://t.co/EkOrp1NaN1,2020-10-27 22:53:00,Twitter for iPhone,16,18,covid; 
The Trump administration is the nation's biggest threat to public health and safety.   Today I joined fellow Wisconsinites to mourn the nearly 600 Milwaukee County residents who passed due to #COVID19.

Notice how the President brings up emails instead of solutions to tackle #COVID19 restabilize our economy and bring jobs back?  We need leadership that's focused on American families. Not collaborating with Russian hackers. #PresidentialDebate2020,2020-10-23 1:33:00,Twitter Web App,4,5,covid; 
Instead of talking about solutions to tackle #COVID19 and bring jobs back the President is bragging about how he's friends with everyone on Wallstreet.   ....are you registered to vote?  https://t.co/u7vndnNYfY   #PresidentialDebate2020,2020-10-23 1:28:00,Twitter Web App,6,6,covid; 
Listen to @JoeBiden folks.  5 minutes in and talking real solutions to tackle #COVID19.  All the President has done is blame China and shrug responsibility for his failed response. #PresidentialDebate2020,2020-10-23 1:22:00,Twitter Web App,13,51,covid; 
.@JoeBiden is right.   #COVID19 cases are on the rise. Just look at what's happening here in Wisconsin.  Yet the President *STILL* has no national testing or tracing plan in place.   SHAMEFUL. https://t.co/71lglS5Vu7,2020-10-23 1:14:00,Twitter Web App,13,12,covid; 
Instead of tackling #COVID head on by protecting our jobs and our lives Republican senators are rushing through a Supreme Court justice who will take away our healthcare in the middle of a pandemic.

The President tried to downplay the coronavirus and dozens within his administration are paying the price.   I’ve said it once and I’ll say it again: Donald Trump is a threat to public health and safety.   Please wear a mask.  https://t.co/e6orTd6Ccg,2020-10-3 21:52:00,Twitter for iPhone,8,19,corona; 
.@JoeBiden is right.   The President knew about #COVID19 in January &amp; did nothing to get ahead of it. He’s been backpedaling ever since.   To be clear we’re 9 months in and still don’t have a national testing strategy.   200000 people have died thanks to Trump’s inaction.,2020-9-30 1:33:00,Twitter for iPhone,27,59,covid; 
More than 180000 Americans have died from #COVID19 and the President still does not have an adequate national testing strategy.  Our families are paying the price. Come November we'll make it right. https://t.co/lq8JmAn9bp,2020-9-1 14:32:00,Twitter Web App,14,15,covid; 
Cases of #coronavirus are on the rise and the President is on the golf course with #LapdogLindsey.  How is this helping our families and economy recover?

Did you see this?  The #coronavirus is on the rise with nearly 140000 dead Americans and Trump’s answer to families looking for a solution that allows us to safely return to work school and hug our loved ones is “it is what it is.”   Shameful but not surprising. https://t.co/DD1XPqrz5t,2020-7-19 15:04:00,Twitter for iPhone,8,8,corona; 
At least on the Titanic they tried to save people!   Trump nails the iceberg #COVID and the response is children and old thrown overboard first in the false belief this will somehow keep ship afloat. https://t.co/u74whjwYvM,2020-7-16 20:03:00,Twitter for iPhone,5,5,covid; 
67% of American families disapprove of Trump’s reckless handling of #coronavirus.   Our families want sound leadership not #fakenews and conspiracy theories. https://t.co/oPfpX9iE8C,2020-7-10 12:28:00,Twitter for iPhone,4,4,corona; 
I’m not sure parents in the U.S. trust the health and wellbeing of their children to ⁦@realDonaldTrump⁩ &amp; the GOP who have badly bungled the #coronavirus pandemic response including telling people to drink bleach or take non-FDA approved drugs.  https://t.co/mGzGazCnhX,2020-7-8 23:07:00,Twitter for iPhone,5,7,corona; 
.@realDonaldTrump is a threat to public safety.   Remember:  The president knew about #coronavirus in January and ignored advice from medical experts.
