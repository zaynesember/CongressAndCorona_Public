ICYMI: I spoke with @komonews about what 8th district residents urgently need in a COVID-19 relief package and why I am recommending against traveling this Thanksgiving week. You can watch the full interview here: https://t.co/3bnZ2h8k7i,2020-11-23 22:39:26,TweetDeck,2,7,covid; 
I continue to push leadership to bring a COVID relief bill to the floor that can pass the Senate and get signed into law. 8th district residents have needed assistance for months! For now if you are in a position to support your local small businesses and restaurants please do.,2020-11-19 22:27:43,Twitter Web App,3,28,covid; 
We also worked on a bill that would provide immediate relief to rural providers. These providers face a lot of the COVID-19 burden on local health care systems and need financial support in order to keep serving their communities and helping all patients. 2/3,2020-11-19 20:50:06,Twitter Web App,0,4,covid;

It's #ChildHealthWeek! The COVID19 pandemic has meant that many vital childhood immunizations have been put on hold.

Thank you to all of the organizations working hard to keep children healthy.,2020-11-12 17:58:40,Twitter Web App,3,14,covid;
