As COVID cases continue to rise across the U.S. and in WA please make good choices. We must stay vigilant and stop the spread of this virus. Continue to practice social distancing avoid large gatherings wash your hands and get your flu shot. #WA08  https://t.co/0iIi7Oxykn,2020-10-18 22:00:44,Gain Platform,9,33,covid; 
When COVID-19 hit the United States it hit Washington State first. In Congress I pushed to get immediate relief for small businesses struggling to stay open and workers who’d lost their jobs. I'll always fight for the people of #WA08.   Watch our new ad to hear more &gt;&gt; https://t.co/cdG0bEiJoU,2020-10-09 16:01:11,Gain Platform,20,53,covid; 
Let me make this clear: COVID-19 is not just the flu. It is a deadly virus that has already taken more than 210000 American lives.  #WA08   https://t.co/uh521thezl,2020-10-08 22:00:02,Gain Platform,17,52,covid; 
.@realDonaldTrump's tweet to not "be afraid of COVID" is irresponsible.   We can't downplay the severity of a disease that's taken over 210000 American lives. Please continue to keep yourself safe by practicing social distancing and wearing a mask. #WA08  https://t.co/Pf0l7wlcq0,2020-10-05 22:12:11,Gain Platform,15,44,covid; 
I went on @KOHO101 to discuss the work I'm doing in Congress to bring assistance to those affected by the wildfires in #WA08 and to protect our communities as we continue to battle the COVID-19 pandemic.

While publicly misleading Americans about the severity of COVID-19 President Trump privately admitted that he wanted to downplay the danger.    His actions have harmed our families and prolonged a pandemic that's taken over 190000 American lives. #WA08  https://t.co/JaP5wSvkrs,2020-09-10 21:00:26,Gain Platform,11,20,covid; 
The CDC recently softened COVID-19 testing recommendations.  Changing the guidelines is reckless and endangers our health. In WA guidance remains the same. Please get tested if you exhibit symptoms or have been in contact with someone who has. #WA08  https://t.co/vc780wJjUE,2020-08-28 17:00:30,Gain Platform,8,35,covid; 
Liddy is an intern with #TeamSchrier!  “Dr. Schrier makes decisions based on facts. This is so important when dealing with issues such as COVID-19 and climate change.”  Thanks for all your hard work Liddy! #WA08 https://t.co/EaDfjRjz1T,2020-07-21 21:00:17,Gain Platform,4,13,covid; 
As COVID-19 cases continue to rise there are precautions we must take before our children return to school.   I recently went on MSNBC to discuss the steps we all need to take to ensure the safety of our teachers and children. #WA08  https://t.co/FVunU7VwWQ,2020-07-14 23:00:17,Gain Platform,7,17,covid; 
The Trump administration began its withdrawal from the World Health Organization this week.   With COVID-19 cases continuing to rise we need the help of health experts to protect us. Withdrawing from WHO puts American lives at risk. #WA08    https://t.co/5ka8RFTRzh,2020-07-10 15:30:51,Gain Platform,12,30,covid; 
Thank you for celebrating safely at home this year and forgoing gatherings in order to protect our loved ones and neighbors from COVID-19. We will make up for it next year if we are fortunate enough to have a vaccine.  Have a safe and happy #IndependenceDay! #WA08,2020-07-04 17:00:32,Gain Platform,7,38,covid; 
President Trump said he asked his administration to slow COVID-19 testing. This is extremely dangerous and will prolong this pandemic that's already killed over 120000 Americans. #WA08  https://t.co/yCC5Bi7sMU,2020-06-22 23:00:32,Gain Platform,7,19,covid; 
As states begin to reopen worldwide COVID-19 cases are rising faster than ever.   We are not out of the woods yet and we must remain vigilant to prevent a resurgence of COVID-19. #WA08   https://t.co/xyQAzUi9wi,2020-06-06 19:00:09,Gain Platform,8,21,covid; 
As a doctor I can tell you that we must continue to make evidence based decisions in response to #COVID19. Statements like these are unhelpful and harmful.   https://t.co/iuetjhFwML,2020-04-24 18:24:32,Twitter for iPhone,15,43,covid; 
The Trump admin slashed air quality standards despite evidence showing a link between air quality &amp; lethal outcomes from COVID-19.   This #EarthDay our government should be looking out for our environment &amp; our health not the fossil fuel industry. #WA08 https://t.co/A007BjAVa5,2020-04-22 20:42:52,Gain Platform,8,16,covid; 
I spoke with @Q13Fox about how robust COVID-19 testing is the key to lifting stay at home orders and bringing back normalcy. #WA08  https://t.co/jdWehSVYM7,2020-04-17 16:00:28,Gain Platform,7,22,covid; 
During this time of uncertainty I know many of you have questions about COVID-19. I recently held a tele-town hall to give an update on the work we've been doing in Congress and answer questions from people in #WA08.

This week the Medicaid system agreed to grant special waivers to Washington hospitals. This will help ensure our health care system can respond more effectively to the COVID-19 crisis. #WA08  Watch me discuss this and more on @NCWLIFE &gt;&gt; https://t.co/9LakQLZVze,2020-03-27 17:00:49,Gain Platform,6,15,covid; 
No matter where you live you deserve access to the health care you need. That's why I introduced a bill to ensure rural hospitals have the funding they need to address the COVID-19 crisis. #WA08   https://t.co/ykQS9FozDp,2020-03-26 23:00:52,Gain Platform,8,42,covid; 
There have been 97 deaths due to #COVID19 in King County alone and we must continue work to flatten the curve. #WA08  Here's what Gov. Inslee's new 'stay-at-home' order does and doesn't restrict.  https://t.co/zn46FdDOZe,2020-03-24 18:46:43,Twitter for iPhone,9,21,covid; 
It’s so important to remain vigilant. At this time the @US_FDA has not authorized any test that purports to enable a person to test themselves at home for #COVID19.  https://t.co/H7vdSEUw8t,2020-03-23 19:40:09,Twitter for iPhone,3,5,covid; 
Two of my COVID-19 response bills passed through the House on Saturday. These bills require insurers to cover the cost of testing and provide states flexibility to administer child nutrition programs to help our families during this crisis. #WA08  https://t.co/SzRFlAXvNy,2020-03-16 22:00:18,Gain Platform,16,60,covid;

While we all continue to monitor the situation with #COVID19 it’s important to be aware that @CDCgov recommends that any non-essential travel be avoided. As a doctor the safety of everyone in #WA08 and across the country is my highest priority.   https://t.co/v2OzRvHU0L,2020-03-13 23:16:47,Twitter for iPhone,8,18,covid;
