As Americans we have so much to be thankful for – from our Constitution that protects our liberties to medical science innovations which have contributed to the speedy delivery of COVID-19 vaccines. I am thankful that healthcare workers are risking their lives to save ours.,2020-11-26 15:19:19,Twitter for iPhone,0,4,covid; 
In-classroom learning is absolutely essential for children.  Isolating students from their support networks is unjustifiable considering the minimal spread of COVID-19 in rural Colorado.  Thanks all for joining me to discuss plans to safely reopen schools. https://t.co/ayHnK7kvE5,2020-08-19 14:39:05,Twitter Web App,40,82,covid; 
This is nothing more than #Russiagate 2.0.   Speaker Pelosi is using USPS conspiracy theories to meddle in the 2020 election.   What happened to providing meaningful COVID-19 relief for struggling Americans? https://t.co/1sQdsqyP4I,2020-08-17 17:20:39,Twitter Web App,675,1466,covid; 
Twitter was noticeably absent from last month’s #BigTech hearing.   It's time we hear from @jack on Twitter's blatant censorship of conservative voices and willingness to protect the Chinese Communist Party's outright lies about the spread of coronavirus.  https://t.co/NFpuofZ4KL,2020-08-07 00:55:20,Twitter for iPhone,302,557,corona;

If Democrats keep playing politics with coronavirus spending bills it could be the death knell of our recovery.   Americans are tired of Pelosi and Schumer piling pork into legislation designed to help small businesses and working-class Americans.  https://t.co/wh0R0Xiem3,2020-07-21 22:05:16,Twitter Web App,102,189,corona; 
Today I introduced the No Bailouts for Illegal Aliens Act to ensure taxpayers aren’t bailing out states and localities that are setting up programs to send COVID-19 cash payments to illegal immigrants. https://t.co/X5M1v2JZTp https://t.co/EuFPttlnke,2020-05-28 17:23:33,Twitter Web App,439,1177,covid; 
Public officials cannot make the best decisions for their constituents with artificially inflated statistics.    I’m calling on the @CDCgov to issue new guidance to follow Colorado’s lead and ensure official death tallies only include cases that are directly related to COVID-19. https://t.co/yckjhrAXWQ,2020-05-21 18:03:54,Twitter Web App,92,200,covid; 
There should always be an asterisk next to anything that China says. The Chinese Communist Party lied about the spread of the coronavirus and put millions of lives at risk.  We cannot continue to fund the World Health Organization if it continues to parrot CCP talking points. https://t.co/QuSeEFkQHh,2020-05-19 18:44:00,Twitter Media Studio,808,889,corona; 
Nancy Pelosi’s latest coronavirus bill is essentially one big get-out-of-jail-free card for millions of prisoners regardless of how heinous their crimes were. https://t.co/CyliqKtF9p,2020-05-14 16:55:51,Twitter Web App,31,51,corona; 
Colorado received over 180000 N-95 masks in the month of April as a result of @WhiteHouse and @FEMA efforts.   Thank you @realDonaldTrump for prioritizing the safety of Coloradans affected by COVID-19!,2020-05-13 15:49:21,Twitter Web App,43,136,covid; 
THIS JUST IN: Under recently passed legislation illegal immigrants are currently eligible for COVID-19 benefits.  Now more than ever we need to prioritize Americans and make sure recovery rebates are only available to people who are in the U.S. legally. https://t.co/RBJ0OGAAUc,2020-05-08 15:31:36,Twitter Web App,94,219,covid; 
The WHO must be held accountable for its role in covering up the Chinese Communist Party’s failed response to #COVID_19.   @realDonaldTrump is right to halt funding for this corrupt organization. https://t.co/TsrPztqHbs,2020-04-14 23:17:47,Twitter Web App,43,167,covid;

I’ve asked the Coronavirus Task Force to provide businesses with industry-specific support and sanitation guidelines to make sure America’s grand reopening is a success.

The Chinese government has covered up its involvement in the coronavirus crisis since the beginning.  It is absolutely necessary that we lead the world community in making sure that China is held accountable in the future. https://t.co/gFp0ILsJ3g,2020-04-03 19:10:00,Twitter Media Studio,1114,1241,corona; 
Rural Health Clinics and Critical Access Hospitals are on the frontlines of the #COVID_19 pandemic in #CO04.   @SBAgov must take immediate steps to ensure CAHs and RHCs are eligible for loan programs so they can continue to serve the community and keep fighting the coronavirus. https://t.co/CKfms7wpG8,2020-04-03 17:02:57,Twitter Web App,8,12,covid; corona; 
Great news! #CO04’s own Aytu Bioscience is stepping up to the plate to provide healthcare professionals with #COVID_19 rapid test kits.  My staff and I have been working consistently with the FDA to approve these rapid tests and I’m pleased Aytu can finally get the ball rolling. https://t.co/hX8cmyQoNn,2020-04-02 17:54:09,Twitter for iPhone,166,370,covid; 
The CCP’s irresponsible handling of the coronavirus and its false propaganda have worsened this global health crisis.  It’s time we as a Congress take a strong stand against China’s nefarious actions.   https://t.co/GxqDGok9iJ,2020-04-02 13:20:12,Twitter for iPhone,819,931,corona;

Unfortunately the CARES Act will harm our future generations in ways that the coronavirus never could — by drastically increasing our national debt by stuffing this bill with pork.  My full statement: https://t.co/POphGdmNQ3,2020-03-27 18:33:47,Twitter Web App,23,77,corona; 
Still I’m finding policies that are straight off of the Democrats’ wishlist in this “coronavirus response” bill.   Page 628 includes a provision that gives sanctuary cities access to $850000000 in law enforcement grants. https://t.co/VES4XkeXKl,2020-03-27 13:57:28,Twitter Web App,44,93,corona; 
Doomsday-like predictions of #COVID_19 have created unnecessary panic and reactionary policy decisions.   We need to instill confidence in the American people and hyperbolic reports like Mr. Ferguson’s are making matters worse. https://t.co/amrIBDNny6,2020-03-26 21:46:52,Twitter for iPhone,22,44,covid; 
Funding for “Washington’s Opera House” has no place in a coronavirus response bill.   We need to focus on policy that will instill confidence in the American people and get our economy back up and running. https://t.co/wykYeD0eHb,2020-03-25 22:03:55,Twitter Web App,94,181,corona; 
This “coronavirus response” package has special carveouts of $75M for public broadcasting and $50M for museums/libraries.   That’s $125M for pet projects instead of for struggling families and businesses.   Dems are again exploiting a crisis to fund their liberal wishlist. https://t.co/l7hEaN2c6w,2020-03-25 20:00:48,Twitter Web App,101,207,corona; 
Everyone should read through this thread on just how ridiculous Nancy Pelosi’s "coronavirus response" bill is.   How exactly are carbon emissions requirements for airlines or same-day voter registration supposed to help vulnerable populations during these hard times? https://t.co/IbEAQBZuf6,2020-03-23 19:07:50,Twitter for iPhone,247,355,corona; 
“We cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself."   I commend the President’s leadership and appreciate his holistic approach to combating the coronavirus.

During my interview with @DanCaplis last night I made it clear that the President is acting in a very measured way to reassure Americans and prevent coronavirus panic.  My problem is with the many conflicting rules from different levels of leadership that cause even more panic. https://t.co/0QzFVyGkH8,2020-03-20 21:07:12,Twitter Web App,8,36,corona; 
It’s our responsibility as members of Congress to promote calm and examine the #COVID_19 situation strategically using facts not hyperbole.

All sorts of Christmas-tree ornaments were added to this bill. 15% of the funds were to be spent on foreign countries &amp; millions went towards unrelated telehealth funding.
