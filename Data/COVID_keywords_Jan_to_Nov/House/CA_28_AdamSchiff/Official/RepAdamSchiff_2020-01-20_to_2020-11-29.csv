Dear @GSAEmily   Your refusal to recognize Biden’s win will do serious long-term harm.   To national security our fight against COVID and more.   Trump’s frivolous lawsuits and baseless conspiracies to overturn the people’s mandate will not succeed.   Do your duty. Right now. https://t.co/jQ3RRQMVq7,2020-11-23 20:17:30,Twitter Web App,6103,28849,covid; 
We’re at a crossroads in our fight against coronavirus.  The virus is spreading as rapidly as it was in the spring.  I know it’s tough. But now is the time to make sacrifices so we can save lives.  Mask. Social distance. Limit travel and gatherings.  Stay safe Californians. https://t.co/ImtDPSFGGk,2020-11-20 02:21:11,Twitter for iPhone,600,3908,corona; social distance; 
A tragic milestone: California now has 1 million cases of COVID-19.  It didn’t have to be this way. But we’re not powerless against this virus.  Be as cautious if not more as you were in March. Wear a mask. Limit travel. Social distance.  We can save lives. But we have to act. https://t.co/LlrFOnAcC1,2020-11-13 02:54:43,Twitter for iPhone,1209,5616,covid; social distance; 
Some good news to start your week: Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine may be more than 90% effective.  There’s light at the end of the tunnel but the virus is still spreading.  As scientists continue to work on a vaccine we all have to do our part. Wear a mask. Social distance. Be safe. https://t.co/Si1AXphitd,2020-11-09 18:54:30,Twitter for iPhone,861,7096,covid; social distance; 
It didn’t have to be this way.  But now we must live with the enormous and unimaginable loss. Americans will carry this collective grief for decades.  In honor of all the lives cut tragically needlessly short:  Wear a mask. Social distance. Stay home and stay safe.  And vote. https://t.co/PPchXoOj8u,2020-10-23 14:34:17,Twitter Web App,2450,11113,social distance; 
It’s time to stop playing games Mitch McConnell.   The coronavirus crisis is far from over. Millions of Americans need help. Desperately.

Act like it. https://t.co/gtkinb4jgp,2020-10-20 21:36:53,Twitter for iPhone,5874,18034,corona; 
Donald Trump held a super-spreader event at the White House. Now he wants to hold another big rally there and still refuses to wear a mask.  I don’t think Donald Trump wants even more Americans to be infected with COVID-19.  But if he did would he be doing anything different? https://t.co/g5kGsSpKP4,2020-10-10 00:01:48,Twitter for iPhone,2636,9303,covid; 
COVID-19 cases are once again on the rise nationally.  Instead of acting to slow the spread Trump is taking $300 million from the CDC for an election season ad campaign.  On masks? No. Distancing? No.  To claim everything is fine. It’s not.  It’s corrupt pathetic and deadly. https://t.co/QF83yk5dGX,2020-09-27 15:14:12,Twitter for iPhone,4447,10038,covid; 
Trump misled the country in February when he downplayed the severity of the virus but told Bob Woodward that COVID-19 was deadly airborne and worse than any flu.  That he is still lying about the virus with 200000 Americans dead and no end in sight is simply monstrous: https://t.co/H2dvp8vxU3,2020-09-22 22:11:12,Twitter for iPhone,4417,12234,covid; 
Another tragic milestone: 200000 Americans have died of coronavirus.  It is difficult to grasp the enormity of this loss. And it’s even more difficult to reckon with the fact this tragedy was avoidable if we had competent presidential leadership.  It didn’t have to be this way.,2020-09-22 19:00:14,Twitter for iPhone,3600,13381,corona; 
Trump knew how deadly COVID-19 was in February.  Not only did he downplay it he blocked steps that would have saved lives.  @RepRoKhanna and I have bills to send masks to the American people just as the USPS wanted to do in April.  It made sense then and it still does. https://t.co/ilFrJbnLMm,2020-09-17 20:55:42,Twitter for iPhone,3824,9519,covid; 
Trump’s own DHS warned us:   "Russia is likely to continue amplifying criticisms of vote-by-mail and shifting voting processes amidst the COVID-19 pandemic to undermine public trust"   Whose criticisms are they amplifying?  Yet again Trump aligns his interests with the Kremlin. https://t.co/Uuumnr23LD,2020-09-17 15:53:01,Twitter for iPhone,2765,6931,covid; 
Trump encouraged us to take unproven drugs mocked wearing masks and mused about injecting bleach. He knew how deadly COVID was and lied.  Stop playing games with our lives Mr. Trump.

Mitch McConnell’s legislative graveyard:  Trillions in coronavirus relief: 121 days  Expanding voting rights: 281 days  Protecting elections: 326 days  Lowering drug prices: 486 days  Protecting coverage for preexisting conditions: 493 days  Universal background checks: 564 days,2020-09-13 16:56:50,Twitter for iPhone,19303,39690,corona; 
The best defense we have against COVID-19 is science.  And from the beginning Trump has marginalized and attacked experts.  That’s why the U.S. has fared worse than any other developed nation. 190000 Americans have died.  How many more have to die until Trump understands? https://t.co/f8oAkMNffd,2020-09-12 19:10:54,Twitter for iPhone,3338,9336,covid; 
In February Trump told a reporter COVID-19 was "more deadly than even your strenuous flu."  But publicly he was calling it "totally under control" and it would miraculously "disappear."  Trump knew and did nothing. He’s a disgrace.  And now nearly 190000 Americans are dead. https://t.co/lEcCj1P1f2,2020-09-09 18:58:10,Twitter for iPhone,4432,11050,covid; 
Other nations contained COVID and saved lives with widespread testing and tracing.  But Trump’s lack of strategy has led to tens of thousands of deaths and now they appear to be ordering less testing.  They’re ok with more loss of life.   Just as long as Trump doesn’t look bad. https://t.co/V2ACke78CM,2020-08-26 18:56:09,Twitter for iPhone,3083,7975,covid;

Donald Trump on coronavirus:  Totally under control. (It wasn't.)  Anyone that wants a test can get a test.  (Not true.)  I don’t take responsibility at all.  (That much is clear.)

We have lost more than 155000 Americans to COVID-19.  Families are mourning. Friends are unable to gather to remember their lives. Communities are torn apart.  It doesn’t have to be this way.

.@Andy is right. The FDA blood ban is discriminatory and unscientific.  Blood or plasma donations rules should be based on science not bias especially when they could help those suffering from COVID-19.

In this sentence we see but one reason Trump is a failed president:  “...senior advisers began presenting Trump with maps and data showing spikes in coronavirus cases among ‘our people’ in Republican states.”  He never viewed himself as representing all of the American people. https://t.co/z5gMPEGamV,2020-07-27 14:09:29,Twitter for iPhone,8579,24950,corona; 
It isn’t enough to beat coronavirus.

Shutting down is a difficult decision but @GavinNewsom is right to do so given the surge in COVID-19 infections across California.  We all must do our part to slow the spread and save lives by social distancing and wearing masks.

Let's review Trump’s comments on COVID-19:  The virus is “very much under control."  It will disappear “like a miracle."  “Anyone that wants a test can get a test."  “Slow the testing down.”  “I don’t take responsibility at all."  And the result? 135000 Americans are dead.,2020-07-13 21:15:54,Twitter for iPhone,13628,39251,covid; 
People under 35 are increasingly testing positive for COVID-19. But we can slow the spread – by wearing masks.  Many young people around our community are showing the way by wearing masks social distancing and urging neighbors to do the same.  Masks work. Masks save lives: https://t.co/4hSdFQyB4L,2020-07-08 21:16:07,Twitter Media Studio,1412,4825,covid; 
Five percent of GDP? One Trillion Dollars. A cloth mask? A few dollars.  Fighting COVID-19 is expensive. Masks are cheap and they save lives.

132000 Americans are dead from COVID-19.  Americans will not “grow numb” as thousands more of our fellow citizens die.  No other country has failed so horrendously to fight the pandemic.

Trump asked Russia for help in his election. He coerced Ukraine.  And now according to Bolton Trump asked China too:  Begging President Xi to help his reelection in exchange for trade concessions.

COVID-19 has taken more than 115000 American lives and infected over 2 million more. This isn’t the first pandemic to hit us nor will it be the last.

Almost 115000 Americans have died from COVID-19. Millions are demanding justice and an end police brutality. And Mitch McConnell still hasn’t acted on the Heroes Act.  So what’s the Senate doing?

Over 90000 Americans have died from COVID-19. Our economy is in a downward spiral to Great Depression-levels.  Trump doesn't want the public to focus on his tragic failures.

Someone close to the President tested positive for COVID-19 so Trump was tested.  This is why it’s vital to observe good practices like social distancing and masks.
