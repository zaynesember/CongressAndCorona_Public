You know what I rarely retweet Sean Hannity.  But he's right about my message to all Americans:  The virus is still spreading. Mask up. Social Distance.  Save lives! https://t.co/7qgNk5pyuD,2020-11-10 20:20:59,Twitter for iPhone,204,1793,social distance; 
We don’t know much about Donald Trump’s second term agenda.  But apparently priority one is to fire the world’s leading expert on infectious disease Dr. Fauci as COVID infections surge.  Another Trump term will be even worse than the first. We can’t let it happen.  Vote. https://t.co/7bzoueP5MG,2020-11-02 19:03:56,Twitter for iPhone,389,1615,covid; 
Trump’s campaign is taking Dr. Fauci’s words out of context to make their failed COVID-19 response seem like a success.  In reality they’ve silenced and sidelined Fauci and anyone else who contradicts Trump’s message.  The results of their dishonesty and incompetence are deadly. https://t.co/74c7ihiDmO,2020-10-12 00:39:32,Twitter for iPhone,673,2236,covid; 
The alternate fact convention is in full gear.   But the truth on COVID is that Trump:  Didn't act quickly.  Didn't act effectively.   And sure as hell didn't act compassionately.   That's why the health of our nation our economy and our democracy depend on voting him out.,2020-08-26 15:34:57,Twitter for iPhone,1123,3919,covid; 
Fact check: True.  The differences are stark. Joe Biden is a good decent man. And Trump is not.  For another you won’t see Biden give a rambling campaign speech full of utter nonsense from the White House on a day over 700 Americans died from COVID-19. https://t.co/3dvrwuVuCt,2020-07-15 19:23:48,Twitter Web App,321,1407,covid; 
Days since the House passed the Heroes Act: 46  Increase in U.S. coronavirus cases since then: 1.14 million  Millions of Americans still unemployed: 19.5   Number of judges the Senate had time to confirm: 7  Number of times they put the Heroes Act up for a vote: 0,2020-06-30 15:58:23,Twitter Web App,841,1985,corona; 
In the chaos of the Covid-19 outbreak Congress didn’t get everything right but we delivered a lot of economic help to Americans who needed it.  It’s helped. But the crisis is not over.  With millions still unemployed and struggling this is no time to be complacent. https://t.co/FAV3C9gljr,2020-06-24 20:12:03,Twitter for iPhone,135,605,covid; 
Imagine what the history books will say:  "As nearly 100000 Americans died from COVID-19 and unemployment hit levels unseen since the Great Depression Mitch McConnell called the Senate back   To confirm judges  And the millions of Americans in need of help — just had to wait",2020-05-20 20:46:09,Twitter Web App,1964,5811,covid; 
On 9/11 our country came together after tragedy struck.  The human toll from coronavirus is many times higher. And once again we turn to our first responders for help and comfort.  We owe them a debt of gratitude we can never repay.  Every single day. https://t.co/8beLv2prb4,2020-05-10 00:18:21,Twitter Web App,326,1717,corona; 
Trump said it was a hoax that Russia helped get him elected. It was all too true  He said Ukraine was a hoax as he corruptly withheld military aid  He said that warnings about Covid-19 were a hoax  Now over 70000 are dead  Also not a hoax:  He’s the worst President ever,2020-05-08 22:04:10,Twitter Web App,4869,20280,covid; 
70000 souls have now been lost from coronavirus in the U.S.  More than the Vietnam War. More than twenty 9/11s.  They aren't just numbers.  They're mothers fathers daughters and sons friends and neighbors. All deeply missed by their loved ones.  Let's hold them in our hearts.,2020-05-06 15:46:57,Twitter for iPhone,1401,5535,corona; 
Coronavirus has changed how we commemorate the Armenian Genocide.  But we still remember. We still put candles in the window. We still meet virtually.  And we know that this community is strong and that we will be together again.  We will never forget. https://t.co/2HUh9MU6lc,2020-04-25 19:32:08,Twitter Media Studio,269,1368,corona; 
Our nation is facing a crisis with coronavirus unlike any we’ve experienced before.   The Administration was slow to respond. Now the estimates are that 100000 may die.   The first person Trump fired?   The Captain who begged for help for his crew. https://t.co/7VuBjDjWoH,2020-04-03 20:30:08,Twitter for iPhone,4734,13685,corona; 
In a public health crisis voting is still essential and there are still safe ways to vote:  In most states you can register online  And send in your ballot by mail.

As @RepKatiePorter demonstrates the CDC has the legal authority to allow every American to get free testing and treatment for coronavirus during a public health emergency.  We must ensure cost is no barrier to getting tested protected and cared for. We’re all in this together. https://t.co/X5eA77ukqz,2020-03-13 15:18:15,Twitter for iPhone,1067,3898,corona; 
Congress has passed a funding package for testing care and research on coronavirus.   We have plans for worker protections free testing paid sick leave and more.  We stand ready to stem the economic damage.  Now all we need is for the President to take this crisis seriously. https://t.co/CC5sLr9ozd,2020-03-10 14:41:31,Twitter for iPhone,851,3233,corona; 
Congress just overwhelmingly passed a $8.3 billion package to fight coronavirus. It will:  —Fund medical supplies treatment and research  —Reimburse states and cities who will lead our response if the infection spreads  —Speed development of treatments and a vaccine https://t.co/I3KGxfju6x,2020-03-05 20:30:19,Twitter Web App,317,1498,corona; 
To fight the Coronavirus people who are ill must get tested when it is indicated. And stay home if they’re sick  But for millions that can be financially ruinous  Universal healthcare and paid sick leave  It’s always been the right thing to do   Now more than ever. https://t.co/LaJ15VbrVj,2020-03-01 22:04:47,Twitter Web App,2741,8238,corona; 
The White House budget request for coronavirus aid isn't sufficient and worse it would cut other health priorities to pay for it.  Congress is going to put forward a real plan to contain the virus and help prepare.  We need a calm science-based response to this growing crisis. https://t.co/AaLIWfGBFD,2020-02-28 20:14:04,Twitter Web App,1431,4815,corona;
