The Keys has its first reported cases of #COVID19.   Both are travel-related &amp; there is no indication of community spread.

Today I sent a letter to @GovRonDeSantis recommending proactive actions &amp; policies to mitigate the spread of #COVID19.  Combating this pandemic is going to require a whole of gov't response.

I sent a letter to Gov. DeSantis this morning asking him to put a stay-at-home order in place for the entire state.  We have a very vulnerable population in FL - 1/4 people is 60+.
