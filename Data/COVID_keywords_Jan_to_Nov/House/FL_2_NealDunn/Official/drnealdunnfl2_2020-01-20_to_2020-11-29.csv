The COVID-19 pandemic has heavily impacted our small businesses this year. If you have the means to please support a local small business today. #SmallBusinessSaturday https://t.co/7mvFqgU7u5,2020-11-28 17:03:12,Twitter for iPhone,3,4,covid; 
Thanks to Operation Warp Speed &amp; the Trump Administration if the FDA approves the Pfizer vaccine we will have 100 million doses ready for distribution. Americans will be able to receive the vaccine free of cost. #FL02 #COVID19 https://t.co/VBKWn5l0jE,2020-11-09 17:39:24,Twitter Web App,6,14,covid; 
Pending FDA Emergency Use Authorizations we may have up to 100 mil doses of FDA-authorized vaccine by the end of the year &amp; project having manufactured enough doses for every American who wants a vaccine by March-April 2021. #OperationWarpSpeed #COVID19,2020-10-08 01:23:41,Twitter Web App,1,5,covid; 
The Trump Administration’s goal is to ensure every American can get a safe &amp; effective #COVID19 vaccine w/o any out of pocket cost. Any vaccine or therapeutic doses purchased w/ U.S. taxpayer $$ will be given to the American people at no cost. #operationwarpspeed https://t.co/4P1fYOsp9M,2020-10-08 01:23:40,Twitter Web App,3,8,covid; 
For months Nancy Pelosi has held up aid for our small businesses. This week my Republican colleagues &amp; I said enough &amp; that it’s time to bring this bill to the House floor for a vote.

My prayers are with @realDonaldTrump &amp; Melania as well as all of those currently recovering from #COVID19. (2/2),2020-10-02 15:37:00,Twitter Web App,1,7,covid; 
I’m wishing @realDonaldTrump &amp; Melania a speedy recovery. #COVID19 is a tough adversary; however the President &amp; First Lady are fighters. We’ve made outstanding progress with treatments in the past few months &amp; I’m confident that both will overcome this quickly. (1/2),2020-10-02 15:36:59,Twitter Web App,4,30,covid; 
#OperationWarpSpeed is not only an effort to find a #COVID19 COVID19 vaccine; it's an effort to find safe &amp; effective therapeutics as well. I'm amazed by the scientific advancements we've seen in the past few months. Watch the video below to learn more. #FL02 https://t.co/PdDvSqOOLz,2020-09-21 18:10:15,Twitter Web App,2,6,covid;

I applaud President Trump &amp; his Administration for taking the initiative to make our nation more independent as we fight the #COVID19 pandemic. For far too long we’ve relied on suppliers outside of the US &amp; our allies for medical supplies &amp; essential prescription drugs. #FL02,2020-08-06 23:27:17,Twitter Web App,6,14,covid; 
It is easy to give up hope &amp; succumb to fear but that is a recipe for failure for us &amp; our children. The only way to overcome this pandemic is to approach it with facts courage &amp; a level-head.

In times like these we should be more focused on using taxpayer dollars to help the American people.  NOT handpicking select committees for political purposes.  I do not see a compelling reason for yet another oversight mechanism. #FL02 #COVID19,2020-04-23 17:37:13,Twitter Web App,1,1,covid; 
Speaker Pelosi has created a “House Select Committee on the Coronavirus Crisis” but there are already EIGHT mechanisms to oversee the govt’s response.   Why does she want to add her own select committee? #FL02 #COVID02,2020-04-23 17:37:13,Twitter Web App,3,0,covid; corona;

I support @realDonaldTrump in hitting the pause button on WHO funding. We need to reevaluate the use of taxpayer dollars &amp; whether they would be better spent in combating #COVID19 &amp; preventing the spread of future pandemics.,2020-04-15 23:48:34,Twitter Web App,0,11,covid; 
The @WHO was negligent &amp; potentially complicit in the Chinese coverup of the #Coronavirus which has so far claimed the lives of 26000 Americans &amp; brought the world to the brink of economic meltdown.,2020-04-15 23:48:33,Twitter Web App,2,14,corona;
