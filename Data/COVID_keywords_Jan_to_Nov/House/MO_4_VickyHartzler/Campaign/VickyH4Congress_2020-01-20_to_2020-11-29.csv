I appreciate the @MoCattle’s support of legislation I’m sponsoring called the Market Transparency Act. This legislation would increase price transparency in the cattle market to help farmers &amp; ranchers recover from COVID. https://t.co/6PNwBMmZAj,2020-10-30 18:32:45,Twitter for iPhone,2,4,covid;

Today is Old Farmer’s Day in honor of the hard labor of farmers throughout American history including during the pandemic. As one of the few farmers in Congress I’m working on bills to help farmers and ranchers recover from the coronavirus.,2020-10-12 14:29:26,Twitter Web App,3,4,corona;

I appreciate the efforts of @realDonaldTrump to fight the coronavirus and begin rebuilding the economy. If it were Joe Biden in the White House he would prevent our economy from moving forward: https://t.co/1Ppg0EBteO.,2020-05-06 16:12:09,Twitter Web App,0,0,corona;
