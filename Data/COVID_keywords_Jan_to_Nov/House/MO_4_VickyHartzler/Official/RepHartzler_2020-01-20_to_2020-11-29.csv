Operation Warp Speed is in full effect to provide a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine!  I agree with CDC Director Robert Redfield. We MUST ensure red tape doesn't stop this needed vaccine from getting to the American people.   America will win this battle on coronavirus. https://t.co/ZgA0stNfCW,2020-09-03 14:11:54,Twitter Web App,159,429,covid; corona; 
We must renew restore and rebuild our country in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.

This was the right decision by @realDonaldTrump. The WHO's handling of the coronavirus was a total blunder covering for #China and the #CCP.  This is just the latest controversy having aggressively promoted abortion using organizational funds (much coming from U.S. taxpayers). https://t.co/zx1vaESXb5,2020-07-08 15:00:15,Twitter Web App,8,23,corona; 
In the case of COVID-19 the world is paying for the #CCP's dishonesty with thousands of lost lives and economic devastation. Now is the time to come together and take action to protect America from the communists in #China.  My latest in @TheHill: https://t.co/aB2TLh5ZWg,2020-07-01 21:15:46,Twitter Web App,651,1286,covid; 
States re-opening is welcomed news!   As we grapple with the #coronavirus many furloughed or temporarily laid off employees are returning to work and businesses are bouncing back from this economic downturn.   Our response is working. Let's keep the momentum going. https://t.co/5TKOg9zjWz,2020-06-12 20:46:58,Twitter Web App,26,102,corona; 
Thank you for your leadership @realDonaldTrump 🇺🇸   I was part of a bipartisan group that urged President Trump to keep the National Guard serving #COVID19 relief efforts at their current status.  He listened and he delivered. They have been an extraordinary help for Missouri. https://t.co/rcOg7S6GP4,2020-05-29 15:51:36,Twitter for iPhone,3,15,covid; 
Nonprofits such as religious ministries and food pantries are vital organizations in our communities.  The Service Assurance Act affords them a layer of legal protection as states reopen protecting these core community partners against threats of COVID-19 liability lawsuits. https://t.co/TnYrHlZcO8,2020-05-22 14:11:47,Twitter Web App,6,14,covid; 
It’s clear that @realDonaldTrump and his admin have been leading behind the scenes not seen in the media today.

Last night I participated in the #MOTownhall with @Fox4KC and the Nexstar Media Group across Missouri.

The world is waking up to #China's deliberate deceit over the #coronavirus. Once again Beijing proves it is not a trusted actor.  America it's time we cut our dependency on China for our pharmaceuticals. Let's take back control of our own security. https://t.co/GlbVaFyqk3,2020-05-04 14:19:20,Twitter Web App,483,509,corona; 
"China’s coronavirus actions are just one of many threats it poses." @NikkiHaley is right on this!  We must reduce our dependence on #China and look for alternative supply chains for critical industries. It's time for America and our allies to stand up.  https://t.co/GNs2JoUXdZ,2020-05-01 18:40:02,Twitter Web App,231,848,corona; 
The #coronavirus highlights our reliance on #China in many sectors essential to national security like our pharmaceutical industry.  That's why I'm leading a bill with @RepGaramendi to reduce our military's dependency on China for basic medical supplies. https://t.co/SYY0jliAXp,2020-05-01 15:13:09,Twitter Web App,951,1025,corona; 
#China's deceit is responsible for the #coronavirus crisis both the health crisis and the economic downfall. China must be held accountable for its spread and for making it harder for the world to respond.   @SecPompeo is absolutely right on this. https://t.co/kDTfLQAwBd,2020-04-30 16:41:24,Twitter Web App,514,580,corona; 
The #PaycheckProtectionProgram is a crucial element of our response to the #coronavirus.   As small business owners my husband and I know the financial uncertainty as we face this threat so we took action to ensure our employees remained on the payroll: https://t.co/vvIqShlwPv,2020-04-29 22:16:21,Twitter Web App,36,87,corona; 
I just voted in support of the #PaycheckProtectionProgram and Health Care Enhancement Act.  ☑️ $310b for #PPP ☑️ $75b for hospitals ☑️ $25b to expand #coronavirus testing  Help is on the way.

We cannot forget our farmers and ranchers who are in desperate need of relief. The #coronavirus has disrupted commodity values and drastically reshaped supply chains.

#China must be held accountable for their lies and cover-up regarding #coronavirus. Their deceit has killed Americans and around the world crippling our economy.

The #PaycheckProtectionProgram is keeping small businesses afloat and employees on the payroll as we face the #coronavirus battle.

I'm pleased to see the federal government's response to the #coronavirus is finally taking shape for Missouri's hospitals:  5000+ Missouri health care providers totaling ~$618.6 million were paid through the first disbursement for hospitals under the CARES Act.,2020-04-13 15:36:06,Twitter Web App,8,23,corona; 
From a.m. call with @VP:  ☑️ Direct payments go out next week ☑️ $90b+ gone out to small biz ☑️ #Coronavirus hotspots stabilizing ☑️ 50k Americans brought home ☑️ $30b to hospitals more on the way  I appreciate the great leadership of VP @Mike_Pence and @realdonaldtrump’s team!,2020-04-08 17:33:19,Twitter for iPhone,4,20,corona; 
Today is #WorldHealthDay  We know the importance of rural hospitals providing critical medical resources to 2.25 million Missourians.

#China's lies and deceit made it harder for the world to respond to the #coronavirus. They are responsible for this pandemic and should NOT be relied on for our medicine - certainly not our military's medicine.

The reinforcements sent to the frontlines of this war must be as bold and extraordinary as the #coronavirus crisis itself.

I'm in Washington and will be voting YES on today's coronavirus bill.  We are fighting a two-front war – a public health battle and an economic battle.

Just as @realDonaldTrump reduced our dependence on  Middle East oil we should also reduce our dependence on #China for our pharmaceuticals.  If #COVID19 has taught us anything it's that China should NOT be trusted with our servicemembers' medicine.  https://t.co/PiIBB5ZoF3,2020-03-25 23:20:47,Twitter Web App,696,823,covid; 
I signed onto a delegation letter to urge @realDonaldTrump to approve the request for a major disaster declaration for Missouri.

#China must be held to account for their response to the #coronavirus. The lack of transparency and their shrewd secrecy made it incredibly difficult for the world to respond to #COVIDー19.

These stories from our rural communities need to be heard.

The #CoronavirusOutbreak highlights a grave national security concern.   In a time of conflict #China could stop our supply of generic prescription drugs and basic medical equipment.
