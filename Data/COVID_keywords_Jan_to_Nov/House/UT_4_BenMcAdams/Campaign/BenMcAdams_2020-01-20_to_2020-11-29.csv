Initially Congress came together in a bipartisan way extended lifelines to individuals and small businesses. But since then partisanship returned. I've called on both sides to come together on the next COVID-19 relief package. #utpol #2020debate,2020-10-13 00:09:39,Twitter Web App,3,17,covid; 
I had to get a Covid test in advance of a medical checkup. I thought I’d share what it’s like. It’s been three months since I was in the hospital with Covid-19. As expected the test was negative. If you have symptoms please get tested. The test isn’t as bad as it looks. #utpol https://t.co/B5NOj3GKdp,2020-07-06 20:38:12,Twitter for iPhone,42,375,covid; 
@ALovelyDesigner @RepBenMcAdams I voted FOR the stimulus that passed last week. There’s another stimulus bill being debated in the Senate that will eventually come to the House where I can vote on it. I’m currently in the hospital with COVID 19 but still working to get a bill passed to help people like you.,2020-03-24 01:15:52,Twitter for iPhone,0,0,covid;
