Good news ➡️ the House just passed a bill to support federal state and local efforts to combat the coronavirus. Make no mistake our role here is not done and we must continue to aggressively work to keep Americans safe.

The Chinese Communist Party has been not at all transparent about the coronavirus has refused the help of our experts and has endangered global health.   But sure they should probably run an organization responsible for protecting the world's health.  https://t.co/u9KY02JHpU,2020-03-04 21:43:52,Twitter Web App,92,118,corona; 
The coronavirus outbreak has revealed severe vulnerabilities in our medical supply chain. That's why @repmarkpocan and I introduced HR 6049 to ensure the FDA better identifies potential shortages and protects access to lifesaving medicines and supplies. https://t.co/ObQ8n0jFdQ,2020-03-04 00:03:27,Twitter Web App,7,22,corona; 
The U.S. government is committed to taking every step necessary to combat the threats of COVID-19. While the risk to Americans remains minimal visit the @CDCgov's website for information on the virus and ways you can reduce exposure.  https://t.co/5s3VxCUgxt,2020-03-02 14:32:34,Twitter Web App,106,139,covid; 
.@joshrogin is right: the coronavirus is "immune to Chinese government propaganda."   For everyone's sake Beijing must be fully transparent about the virus and the severity of this epidemic so we can properly address this threat.   https://t.co/dBJmJrbOhK,2020-02-28 00:09:03,Twitter Web App,212,288,corona; 
If you're blaming America rather than the Chinese Communist Party for the coronavirus you're flat out wrong.,2020-02-27 19:44:20,Twitter Web App,40,176,corona; 
Another reason no one should trust the official coronavirus numbers coming from the Chinese government: Xi is facing intense pressure to get China back to work. Unfortunately for Xi the CCP's Chernobyl is exposing the Party's ineptitude and corruption. https://t.co/mWpq0jKZ1T,2020-02-27 14:13:34,Twitter Web App,834,937,corona; 
Extremely concerning to see coronavirus now impacting the USFK family. Not only do we need all hands on deck to ensure our service members and their families are safe but an outbreak could also have disastrous impacts on training and readiness. https://t.co/O0pZaNZSZ7,2020-02-24 14:01:10,Twitter Web App,9,10,corona; 
Must read: How the coronavirus (aka the Chinese Communist Party’s Chernobyl) exposes the U.S. medical system's unhealthy reliance on China for drugs and supplies. We must strengthen our medical supply chains to include greater domestic vaccine production https://t.co/SW3hlZRMFa,2020-02-06 11:43:38,Twitter for iPhone,947,1191,corona; 
Must read. Weekly reminder that the Chinese Communist Party is not being fully transparent about the Wuhan coronavirus is refusing the help of our experts and is thereby endangering global health. We must be more aggressive in order to prevent a US outbreak. https://t.co/b8OGYW0s6o,2020-02-05 15:34:22,Twitter Web App,671,708,corona;
