This is an unbelievable dereliction of duty. As @GovMurphy said earlier today "we are at war" with #COVID_19 we need to mobilize our manufacturers and act like it. Enough delays @realDonaldTrump let's get to work.,2020-03-21 22:03:30,Twitter Web App,4,12,covid; 
While NJ has received SOME of the medical equipment we need to fight #Covid_19 it isn't enough.

GOP response to COVID-19 is to give half as much to families with fewer means to weather this crisis. Absolutely unacceptable.

I applaud the acceptance of New Jersey’s disaster declaration by the Small Business Administration (SBA) a move that will allow New Jersey businesses and non-profits hit by the coronavirus to apply for disaster assistance loans with deferred repayment and low interest rates.,2020-03-19 01:41:24,Twitter Web App,7,24,corona;

This kind of behavior is inexcusable. Coronavirus does not discriminate on race or ethnicity. We are all in the together. Let’s act like it. Support your neighbors. Check on neighbors and loved ones who live alone or may need help. Practice social distancing to keep us all safe. https://t.co/HfLcgNNRjn,2020-03-18 16:27:24,Twitter for iPhone,15,36,corona; 
The 2nd Coronavirus package includes much-needed assistance while so many are out of work including over 1 billion in food assistance 1 billion to states for unemployment insurance &amp; mandated sick leave. @senatemajldr McConnell and the Senate needs to take these up NOW!,2020-03-17 21:39:23,Twitter Web App,9,36,corona;

To all the young people out there. Even though the mortality rate is low for you even if you feel fine you can still be a carrier of COVID-19 and infect others who are older or have weaker immune systems. You don’t want to be responsible for infecting a friend or loved one. https://t.co/y1DDiZCpyb,2020-03-15 00:01:44,Twitter for iPhone,19,36,covid; 
Some important actions you can take to keep yourself safe from COVID-19 and to prevent its spread: 1. Stay home when sick 2. Avoid touching your face especially your eyes nose or mouth 3. Disinfect objects you touch often. 4. Wash your hands often and for at least 20 seconds. https://t.co/j375kLQE0y,2020-03-13 16:38:27,Twitter Web App,3,8,covid; 
The Trump administration isn’t allowing states to use Medicaid more freely to respond to the coronavirus crisis by expanding medical services.

The @CDCgov was supposed to give NJ the results of our early #coronavirus tests by March 7th. It still has not met that commitment.

This morning the @CDCgov Director told my committee  that "99% of cases last night occurred outside of China. This isn't China. Right now the Epicenter - the New China - is Europe."

If we're serious about stopping a coronavirus outbreak testing and treatment should be accessible to everyone. The danger to ALL Americans is too high NOT to ensure that everyone can be treated.

@AlietaEck The state is monitoring the health of people who have returned from countries with coronavirus cases. So far they have not shown symptoms.   What we are NOT going to do is use panic over coronavirus to target immigrants. Do not spread unfounded rumors or insinuations on my thread,2020-02-28 16:31:10,Twitter Web App,0,2,corona; 
Be wary of fake news surrounding the coronavirus. Confirm that news you get is from a trusted source before sharing. The last thing we need during this situation is false information.,2020-02-28 15:07:21,Twitter for iPhone,5,10,corona;

A poll today shows that a majority of Americans agree that testing and treatment for Coronavirus should be free for all Americans regardless of their insurance.
