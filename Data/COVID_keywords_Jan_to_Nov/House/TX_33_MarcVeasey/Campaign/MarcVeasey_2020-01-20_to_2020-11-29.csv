This type of quote from TX Lt Guv Dan Patrick is exactly why Texans who voted for he and Abbott  2018 are now regretful. #covidisreal https://t.co/sYMBWGEHI3,2020-07-03 22:29:20,Twitter for iPhone,4,6,covid;

Because of the Affordable Care Act 20 million additional Americans gained quality affordable health care. Now more than ever we need to build on that and give uninsured Americans the opportunity to get insured under a special enrollment period for COVID-19.
