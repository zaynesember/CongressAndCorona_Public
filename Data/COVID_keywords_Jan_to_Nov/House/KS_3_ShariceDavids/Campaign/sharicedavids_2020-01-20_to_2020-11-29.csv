Always great to chat with The Pitch about the biggest issues facing our community - from COVID relief to the best barbecue sauce in town and whether or not Patrick Mahomes should run for President (maybe one day but right now we need him where he is).   https://t.co/voEP6c2P5F,2020-10-27 20:18:27,Twitter Web App,15,51,covid; 
Last week I had the chance to help deliver groceries to folks in #KS03 during a community food bank hosted by Roeland Park UMC.

At a time when people across the country are calling out for real leadership this Administration is walking away. It's outrageous and it's wrong.

The coronavirus is not over — and neither are the challenges that Kansans face. I'm continuing to push for bipartisan relief to get help to those who need it most.

A4: COVID-19 has laid bare so many harsh realities that exist in our country - including health disparities. These are complex systemic issues that must be addressed.

When the coronavirus hit and our economy slowed Kansas businesses took a hit. Yet Wall Street’s booming. It shows the deck is stacked.  That's why I'm working to get COVID aid to small businesses keeping Kansans on the job. Watch: https://t.co/nzMjntLjWA,2020-09-08 16:14:14,Twitter Media Studio,42,133,covid; corona;

BIG NEWS! We are up on TV today!   Coronavirus has impacted how we live learn and work. But as the virus surged and our economy slowed down I knew I couldn't.

But we have a lot of work left to do. And that's why I'm running for reelection.   Our country is in crisis.   The coronavirus showed that our economy and healthcare system need to change. I’m committed to making sure those changes help hardworking Kansans not special interests.,2020-08-05 00:29:30,Twitter Web App,34,314,corona; 
Once again this Administration is attempting to downplay the severity of this virus and obscure the facts. This unprecedented move will hurt our ability to fight COVID-19 and undermines the very institutions tasked with keeping us safe. https://t.co/14uYHCepzv,2020-07-15 16:03:02,Twitter Web App,88,270,covid;

It's called the 2019 novel coronavirus or COVID-19. Calling it the "Chinese virus" does nothing but add to the xenophobia Asian-Americans are already experiencing and make it harder to contain the disease.   Let's lead with compassion instead of division and fear.,2020-03-18 17:40:18,Twitter Web App,3025,14704,covid; corona;
