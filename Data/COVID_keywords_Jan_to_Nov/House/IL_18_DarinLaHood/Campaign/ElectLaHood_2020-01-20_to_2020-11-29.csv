One of Illinois’ great strengths is our regional diversity. Our response to #COVID19 must recognize those regional differences.  We need a plan to safely and regionally begin reopening that meets the health and economic needs of individual communities. https://t.co/QPiaU5vI28,2020-05-01 22:43:25,Twitter for iPhone,3,1,covid; 
#COVID19 did not create Illinois’ pension crisis; it illuminated one that already existed. The federal gov’t should not bail out Illinois’ fiscal mismanagement.   Congress should focus on helping Illinois workers small biz and health care professionals. https://t.co/F0KWo5MtxD,2020-04-21 19:39:56,Twitter for iPhone,43,70,covid;
