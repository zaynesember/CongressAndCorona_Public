It's clear that @SpeakerPelosi still hasn't gotten the message: Republicans want to work toward a common sense COVID relief bill that helps the American people. Unfortunately Democrats are more focused on partisan games &amp; pursuing their radical agenda. #LetsWork https://t.co/C3fjRNJrvP,2020-11-24 16:51:44,Twitter Media Studio,87,287,covid;

Our nation faces real challenges because of the coronavirus pandemic and its economic consequences. We need serious competent leadership to address these issues and that means we need a new Speaker of the House. https://t.co/6spELJX7qf,2020-10-20 21:41:39,Twitter Media Studio,25,89,corona; 
House Democrats have a choice to make: will they continue to support @SpeakerPelosi's efforts to block COVID relief for Americans that need it or will they sign @HerreraBeutler's discharge petition extending the Paycheck Protection Program for small businesses? #FightForSmallBiz https://t.co/HVbh6H2hWZ,2020-10-01 18:32:27,Twitter Web App,28,105,covid;

According to Speaker Pelosi:  Brokering a historic agreement between Israel &amp; Bahrain = a "distraction"  Holding China accountable for COVID19 = a "diversion"  You can always count on Speaker Pelosi to put her own political agenda before the safety of the American people.,2020-09-16 15:01:47,Twitter Web App,238,666,covid; 
The Senate is voting today on a COVID-19 relief package that provides targeted aid for families and small businesses. Unfortunately for the American people Speaker Pelosi is still holding relief legislation hostage so that she can pass her partisan wish list. https://t.co/as4aptOLom,2020-09-10 17:28:34,Twitter Web App,146,280,covid; 
Through the China Task Force House Republicans are taking the lead in holding the CCP accountable for unleashing COVID-19 on the world. It's shameful that Speaker Pelosi refuses to work with us while promoting CCP propaganda. Why is she protecting them? https://t.co/JNzjS7mo8c,2020-09-10 14:25:46,Twitter Web App,275,495,covid; 
Monday's House Oversight hearing wasn't about saving the USPS. The facts show that USPS is properly funded. This was a fabricated attack by Speaker Pelosi for political purposes even though she's still holding COVID-19 relief hostage in an effort to pass her partisan wishlist. https://t.co/plGDkFrljX,2020-08-25 13:52:10,Twitter Web App,283,572,covid;

Yesterday @SpeakerPelosi said that efforts to hold China accountable for spreading COVID-19 are “a diversion.”  A real diversion was when she consumed the House Intel Committee with impeachment instead of focusing on global threats including the pandemic threat from China: https://t.co/6LjsBn3ysM,2020-05-15 16:53:13,TweetDeck,73,158,covid; 
The Chinese Communist Party caused COVID-19 to spread around the globe inflicting economic devastation because they did not want to be the only nation that suffered.
