The recent Coronavirus outbreak is shining a light on the oppressive intrusive and deadly policies of the Communist Government of China. Dr. Li was arrested and silenced for trying to warn his country of this deadly outbreak. Dr. Li I wish you Godspeed. https://t.co/uqm7J0qfSB,2020-02-07 18:40:19,Twitter Web App,775,828,corona; 
The Chinese gov't continues feckless &amp; reckless international policies eerily similar to SARS failures which is why I'm actively pressing the #CDC to proactively protect the American People with accuracy &amp; facts. #coronavirususa #coronoravirus   #KnowledgeIsPower #TruthSaves https://t.co/zHMYvWibT7,2020-01-31 21:25:43,Twitter Web App,744,778,corona; 
For years China's communist government has blocked Taiwan’s participation in international organizations.  The recent outbreak of a deadly coronavirus in China and its spread to Taiwan is a clear reason why the US must continue to support Taiwan’s full participation in the WHO. https://t.co/kjfRR5Fsdm,2020-01-22 17:54:00,Twitter Web App,928,1138,corona;
