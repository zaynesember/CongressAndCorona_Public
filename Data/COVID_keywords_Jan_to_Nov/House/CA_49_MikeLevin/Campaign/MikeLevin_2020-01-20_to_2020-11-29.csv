We were closer to a #COVID19 deal than we had been in a long time. Many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have been eager to get more relief to the American people soon.

Trump’s apparent strategy is to pin all his failures on Joe Biden.   Let’s state the obvious here: Trump is President not Biden.  Trump has failed us on COVID-19 and in so many other ways and done nothing but fan the flames of division and fear.  Trump has failed us.

Mitch McConnell said we should let local governments go bankrupt.  Then he said we should pause.   But COVID isn’t taking a pause.  I don’t expect him to agree with every word of what we just passed in the House.    But he must act NOW so a bipartisan compromise can be reached.,2020-05-16 13:42:17,Twitter for iPad,55,190,covid;
