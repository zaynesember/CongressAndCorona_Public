It makes it even more important to elect @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris and a Democratic Congress so we will be in a position to fix the damage the Supreme Court will do to health insurance coverage in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic.,2020-10-27 01:01:01,Twitter for iPhone,0,3,covid; 
After we get COVID under control we must address the child care crisis. All families should be able to afford to send their kids to quality child care. Glad to see @JoeBiden include my bill to cap child care expenses at 7% for hardworking families in his #BuildBackBetter plan!,2020-07-21 18:26:39,Twitter for iPhone,5,13,covid;

Honored to officially be declared the 2020 Democratic nominee for the 3rd congressional district of Virginia! While I am grateful my primary focus at this time is helping our community address the Coronavirus. That’s why I’m back in DC working to pass additional economic relief.,2020-03-27 15:08:27,Twitter for iPhone,4,18,corona;
