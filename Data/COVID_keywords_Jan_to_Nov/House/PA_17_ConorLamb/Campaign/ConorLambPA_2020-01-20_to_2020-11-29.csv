Spoke with @GPghCC members this morning about our coronavirus response the challenges &amp; opportunities ahead of us &amp; what we need to do to beat the virus &amp; get people back to work safely.   A few highlights:,2020-07-10 15:29:02,Twitter Web App,10,39,corona; 
Joined @Darrinkellypgh &amp; @AlleghenyLabor today for an emergency food distribution.   Unions don't just take care of their members. They take care of our communities.  I knew that before #COVID but still blown away by what we've seen from local union members during this crisis. https://t.co/7jivSBUfvf,2020-05-23 02:51:00,Twitter Web App,26,106,covid; 
Spoke with @seiuhcpa President @presyarnell today about the situation at Brighton Rehab &amp; Wellness Center in #PA17 where two residents have died &amp; more than 30 residents &amp; staff have tested positive for #COVID19 #coronavirus.,2020-04-02 20:20:59,Twitter Web App,9,29,covid; corona; 
That's why I cosponsored @TimRyan's bill to require the President to use the #DefenseProductionAct to order medical equipment &amp; PPE.   Hope this bill won't be necessary &amp; the President will do the right thing. But we can't afford to wait any longer. 4/4 #coronavirus #COVID19,2020-03-24 19:23:54,Twitter Web App,8,53,covid; corona; 
It's time now — it was time several days ago — but it is time now to invoke the full powers of the federal government to put the American people first in line for this equipment and to start churning it out in large numbers.   What do we have to lose?  #coronavirus #COVID19,2020-03-20 21:43:30,Twitter Web App,17,66,covid; corona; 
"We need money for people to get through the next month. That is our number-one priority. Every family needs to know that they're going to eat that they're going to pay their mortgage or their rent." #coronavirus #COVID19 https://t.co/rKPjK5Pp8N,2020-03-20 21:22:03,Twitter Web App,15,67,covid; corona; 
The President should not only invoke but USE the Defense Production Act immediately. He could make a call right now &amp; place a $1 billion order for masks ventilators &amp; other protective equipment that our health care workers &amp; first responders desperately need right now. #COVID19,2020-03-19 16:40:09,Twitter Web App,96,390,covid; 
Good to see Senate pass our bill. We need to keep this spirit of bipartisanship alive as we go back to DC &amp; work on the next phases of our response.   Workers the unemployed &amp; people in need of testing were our first priority &amp; will remain our first priority. #coronavirus https://t.co/3croEI7LCt,2020-03-18 20:40:02,Twitter Web App,24,103,corona;
