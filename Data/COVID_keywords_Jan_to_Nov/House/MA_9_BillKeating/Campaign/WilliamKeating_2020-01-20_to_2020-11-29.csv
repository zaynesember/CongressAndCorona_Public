Tired of the lack of progress in Washington on COVID-19 relief? Me too. Here's what the House has passed - twice - and what it means for #ma09.

10 weeks ago I joined my colleagues to pass the #HEROESAct. For 10 weeks that bill has sat on McConnell's desk while millions have lost their jobs or gotten infected by Covid-19.
