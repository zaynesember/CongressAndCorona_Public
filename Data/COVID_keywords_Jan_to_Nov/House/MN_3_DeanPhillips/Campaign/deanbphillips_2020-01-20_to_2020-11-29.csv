Listen to State Representative Dr. Alice Mann’s remarks about covid-19 and then encourage everyone you know to do everything they can to mitigate the spread. We’re America. We unite to protect one another. And we must do so. https://t.co/kz4F4aOcJR,2020-11-13 03:21:20,Twitter for iPhone,20,71,covid; 
How can so many of our leaders care so deeply about defending America from foreign adversaries but care so little about defending us from covid-19 and the undermining of our democratic institutions?,2020-11-13 02:40:52,Twitter for iPhone,21,230,covid; 
Losing @citypages is heartbreaking for the Twin Cities and a painful reminder of how COVID has devastated lives livelihoods and our cultural &amp; economic ecosystem. I intend to put it all on the line to push a bipartisan relief bill through Congress next month. It cannot wait. https://t.co/3YXdSoDwDi,2020-10-28 15:43:57,Twitter for iPhone,12,97,covid;

You’re right Jennifer! No more covid mismanagement no more injustice no more economic devastation no more environmental recklessness no more families bankrupted by medical bills no more international humiliation no more lying and no more chaos. https://t.co/6OH9jV1kkE,2020-09-27 13:56:00,Twitter for iPhone,70,427,covid; 
Everything about this is sickening. Shouting racial and ethnic slurs at @CDC surveyors working to get covid under control? Come on Minnesota. We’re better than that. https://t.co/PZlRAbffNq,2020-09-25 19:17:14,Twitter for iPhone,41,256,covid; 
I’ve never missed a Minnesota State Fair and wasn’t going to let covid keep me from my 51st. While it wasn’t the one to which we’re accustomed I got to share it with my daughter and we left as full and happy as always. Keep the faith and keep your appetites for next year! 🌽🚜 https://t.co/VtzZGW3NR0,2020-09-09 02:43:41,Twitter for iPhone,21,176,covid; 
I have the @amyklobuchar and @peggyflanagan families on my mind and in my heart today along with every family suffering pain and loss due to COVID-19. We’re all in this together and we’ll get out of it together. https://t.co/xOHA3M6dwn,2020-03-23 16:29:50,Twitter for iPhone,10,89,covid; 
Our community and country are strong and I know that optimism is more contagious than coronavirus.  You keep the faith and I’ll keep in touch.-Dean 6/6,2020-03-14 16:20:44,Twitter for iPhone,3,44,corona; 
We each have a role to play in “flattening the curve” and slowing the spread of COVID-19 over time to ensure our healthcare professionals and facilities can meet the growing demand for care. 2/6,2020-03-14 16:20:42,Twitter for iPhone,1,21,covid;
