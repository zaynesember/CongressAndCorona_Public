#COVID19 will also not be the last deadly pathogen the world confronts.  By joining @CEPIvaccines we will help ensure that the U.S. and the world are better prepared for the next deadly disease and that we can stop it before it’s able to cause damage on the scale of COVID.,2020-11-18 22:24:03,Twitter Web App,0,2,covid;

Over 220000 Americans have died from #COVID19 w/ cases rising across the U.S. Instead of issuing a national testing strategy to defeat the virus the President spends his time attacking public health officials.

It is this info and guidance from the #WHO that has helped countries in Europe &amp; Asia tackle and contain #COVID19.  They bent the curve but our cases are increasing.

Now is not the time for the U.S. to go missing from the international stage.  In the absence of U.S. participation and leadership in the global #COVID19 vaccine development other countries may receive a vaccine before our own health care workers.

I joined @RepTedYoho in urging the Admin. to lead international efforts to coordinate the production and distribution of a #COVID19 vaccine.  American ingenuity and leadership have helped contain diseases ranging from Ebola to polio. We can do so again.  https://t.co/b0A11xbuj3,2020-05-01 22:13:20,Twitter Web App,5,18,covid; 
In the absence of U.S. participation and leadership we risk the rules being dictated by countries that may not share our values which could leave American healthcare workers without access to a #vaccine when others receive it. #COVID19,2020-05-01 22:09:42,Twitter Web App,2,11,covid; 
That’s why it’s critical that the U.S. lead on the international development production and distribution of a #COVID19 vaccine including the creation of an international mechanism to ensure that a vaccine reaches healthcare workers around the world first.,2020-05-01 22:07:53,Twitter Web App,3,9,covid; 
Increased #COVID19 testing &amp; contact tracing will allow states to loosen restrictions but only with a vaccine will Americans be able to return to normal.  While I firmly believe the U.S. will be the first country to develop a vaccine it’s possible that others may do so first.,2020-05-01 22:06:23,Twitter Web App,7,19,covid;

Far too many nations suffer from weak health systems w/ unsafe water and inadequate sanitation tools years of conflict humanitarian disasters and food shortages.  All these risk factors around the world only increase the likelihood of #COVID19 reemerging in the United States.,2020-04-28 14:09:30,Twitter Web App,0,3,covid; 
Before #COVID19 hit the @CDC warned that *70%* of countries worldwide were not prepared to prevent detect and respond to a public health emergency. ⚕️  Many nations just aren’t equipped to deal with the #coronavirus or any future pandemic.  #USGlobalResponse,2020-04-28 14:01:43,Twitter Web App,0,4,covid; corona; 
No matter how successful we are in fighting #COVID19 at home we will never defeat it unless other parts of the world are equipped to prevent outbreaks from occurring and can contain them when they do occur.

The #COVID19 pandemic has reinforced this. Since originating in China in Dec. 2019 the virus has quickly spread to 170 countries with over 200000 deaths worldwide.

The decision to halt funding to the WHO *during a global pandemic* is dangerous and short-sighted.  It will take a coordinated international response to defeat #COVID19.
