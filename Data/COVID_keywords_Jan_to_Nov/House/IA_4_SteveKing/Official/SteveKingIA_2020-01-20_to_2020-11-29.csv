.@KimReynoldsIA @IAGovernor Your web site is asking &amp; advising Iowans to squeal on restaurant &amp; bar owners for non compliance with your new COVID orders. You are pitting Iowans against Iowans and turning Iowa into a Surveillance State. https://t.co/vOpE6QDCSG,2020-11-22 22:27:45,Twitter for iPad,42,129,covid;

The motorcoach industry has been among the most decimated by COVID-19. They aren’t asking for handouts but a lifeline to survival.

I’m working with House Ag Chairman Collin Peterson on securing FEMA reimbursements for pork producers who are being forced to euthanize/dispose of hogs. I am also drafting a bill to indemnify them for the COVID-19 losses they are enduring due to packing plant shutdowns. #IA04,2020-05-12 21:59:32,Twitter for iPad,18,57,covid; 
.#IA04 is the #1 pork producing Congressional District in the U.S.. COVID-19 will force our producers to euthanize as many as 10 million hogs worth a billion$’s. We must indemnify them. I will soon introduce a bill to do so. https://t.co/raDZDZR8sF https://t.co/Z3NJtIFtxK,2020-05-08 15:26:22,Twitter for iPad,19,43,covid; 
My thanks to @realDonaldTrump for invoking the Defense Production Act to open up our packing plants that are shut down by #COVID. Here are healthy hogs going to rendering-waste in a hungry world. https://t.co/FdZePHbqme,2020-04-30 08:35:29,Twitter for iPhone,25,85,covid; 
#COVID has shut down a huge %age of meat harvesting capacity. Euthanization of market ready hogs has begun b/c we can’t get &amp; keep plants open. @realDonaldTrump made a timely &amp; correct decision to invoke the Defense Production Act.
