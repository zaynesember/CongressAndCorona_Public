Even Dr. Fauci agrees: Vitamin D is a way to reduce susceptibility to disease and infection. This should be part of our national strategy to curb the effects and spread of COVID 19. https://t.co/Ic3GcVIYYs,2020-09-14 17:00:04,joe.sentry,4,2,covid; 
Recent study found that Vitamin D deficiency increases the likelihood of testing positive for COVID-19 by 77%. I will continue to pressure the CDC to look into the relationship between Vitamin D &amp; COVID because breakthroughs get us closer to defeating it. https://t.co/FZX71aJghZ,2020-09-08 17:25:03,joe.sentry,15,9,covid; 
More studies continue to show the correlation between an increased risk of COVID-19 and low levels of Vitamin D. Ensuring your Vitamin D levels are healthy is an easy step to help make our communities safer and keep our hospitalizations down. https://t.co/hasTFG879g,2020-08-06 17:15:04,joe.sentry,1,1,covid; 
It was a pleasure joining WISC 1130 to discuss what we're working on in Congress COVID-19 relief &amp; the unrest happening across the country. It's always been my mission to stand for Sixth District families expand the economy &amp; support law enforcement. https://t.co/X8lYcUhWFo,2020-07-24 15:50:05,joe.sentry,1,0,covid; 
Battling an invisible enemy like the Coronavirus will take a multi-faceted approach. It's encouraging to see important research going into drugs and remedies that will weaken the severity and mortality rates of COVID-19. https://t.co/u0J4tOGdHK,2020-07-22 20:30:04,joe.sentry,1,0,covid; corona; 
According to studies out of Northwestern University &amp; Trinity College Vitamin-D deficiency plays a role in the severity &amp; mortality rates associated with COVID-19. Did you know WI's 6th District produces many of the Vitamin-D rich products that Americans can take advantage of? https://t.co/siApCU6dh5,2020-07-21 19:00:05,joe.sentry,3,5,covid; 
Thrilled VP @Mike_Pence is in the 6th district today.

There's a correlation between Vitamin D deficiency &amp; COVID-19 mortality rates. My amendment to the HEROES Act which would have required the CDC to research this was shot down by House Dems. I will continue to call on the CDC to study this further. https://t.co/BkY63qHQ1t,2020-07-08 18:10:07,Twitter Web App,5,6,covid; 
Early research has illustrated a clear correlation between vitamin D deficiencies and higher COVID-19 mortality rates. As such I will continue to encourage the CDC to look into vitamin D’s impact on the virus. https://t.co/r19pO1R4Wo,2020-06-08 16:05:04,joe.sentry,4,5,covid;

While we combat COVID-19 we cannot neglect patients who need things like heart stents heart valves and diagnostic testing. We need to get our hospitals reopened safely in Wisconsin.
