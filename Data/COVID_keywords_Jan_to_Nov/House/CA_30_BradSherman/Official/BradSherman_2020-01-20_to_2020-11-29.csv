Asian Americans are increasingly the target of racist attacks as #COVID19 spreads. Asian Americans are not to blame &amp; many are on the frontlines fighting it as doctors researchers &amp; 1st responders. I signed @RepGraceMeng's resolution to condemn this hate &amp; protect all Americans,2020-03-25 17:45:53,Twitter for iPhone,9,18,covid; 
(2/3) I support the big stimulus bill if it’s drafted well &amp; gives big aid to families. But we must remember:   So far the first three bills together provide about $1 billion to fund or incentivize #coronavirus research.   There’s a difference between a billion &amp; a trillion.,2020-03-25 15:10:54,Twitter Web App,1,3,corona; 
(1/3) Medicine teaches: it’s better to treat the cause than to treat the symptoms. The economic downturn is the symptom and we will soon provide over $2 trillion of treatment the cause is the #coronavirus.,2020-03-25 15:10:53,Twitter Web App,3,13,corona;

5/6 At a calmer time we on the @HouseForeign Asia Subcommittee can hold hearings on China and #coronavirus. I think we will find some reasons to criticize China for the first two months of this crisis and reasons to laud their more recent efforts.,2020-03-24 20:02:10,Twitter Web App,2,7,corona; 
2/6 We also need to get private sector drug research companies to pursue every reasonable approach. We need special tax credit for #coronavirus research conducted this year.,2020-03-24 20:02:09,Twitter Web App,1,2,corona; 
As we battle the #CoronavirusPandemic we are grateful that millions of Americans have healthcare thanks to the #AffordableCareAct signed into law 10 years ago today. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/e5SmVGrkTD,2020-03-23 23:39:19,Twitter Web App,1,17,corona; 
As we grapple with #coronavirus today I introduced the Disaster Protection for Workers’ Credit Act which would ensure that people's credit scores are not negatively impacted as a result of the #CoronavirusOutbreak.    https://t.co/dNTp5SXEXM,2020-03-23 22:16:24,Twitter for iPhone,8,19,corona; 
The USNS Mercy the largest naval medical ship on the West Coast should be immediately deployed to the Port of Los Angeles to assist with the #COVID19 response. Today I called on the @DeptofDefense to do just that. https://t.co/b8W70MI4tB,2020-03-22 03:00:47,Twitter for iPhone,21,46,covid;

(2/2) Plenty of blame for the entire political system. We spend nearly a trillion dollars on national defense yet no adequate stockpiles of the masks virus testing supplies or ventilators. #CoronavirusOutbreak,2020-03-19 21:26:02,Twitter for iPhone,4,12,corona; 
I'm pleased to join with @RepAdamSchiff &amp; other colleagues to send this letter in support of our entertainment industry workers during this #coronavirus pandemic. https://t.co/ibbXSFAoWX,2020-03-19 19:49:06,Twitter Web App,13,28,corona; 
We have a research and experimentation tax credit.   We need a special credit for #coronavirus research.  Most research projects fail. We need to encourage every possible private sector research initiative.,2020-03-19 17:31:28,Twitter Web App,1,10,corona; 
The House just took its next major step in combating the spread of the #coronavirus with the #FamiliesFirst Coronavirus Response Act which:  - secures paid emergency/family/medical leave   - strengthens nutrition security initiatives   - increases federal funds for Medicaid,2020-03-14 06:08:48,Twitter for iPhone,9,44,corona; 
(1/3) Today I sent a letter to the Federal Reserve calling for a halt on stock buybacks &amp; dividend payments for "Too Big to Fail" banks until this period of economic stress sparked by the #coronavirus is over. https://t.co/b6zoCNZvkZ,2020-03-13 17:11:10,Twitter Web App,7,20,corona; 
I pressed Wells Fargo's CEO Charles Scharf to halt stock buybacks &amp; dividend payments until this period of economic stress sparked by the #coronavirus is over -- he refused.   #WellsFargo remains "too big to fail" and could pose a risk to the economy.  https://t.co/TwdG3uwl27,2020-03-10 22:09:37,Twitter Web App,9,23,corona; 
Americans need a fully funded &amp; serious government-wide response against the #coronavirus. @HouseDemocrats' emergency response package delivers the resources needed to address this public health crisis while preserving funds for other critical public health priorities. #COVID19 https://t.co/On2OwhZf9C,2020-03-09 20:58:37,Twitter Web App,5,12,covid; corona;

It's outrageous that China has shut out #Taiwan from the @WHO limiting Taiwan’s access to vital information. The #coronavirus is an international health emergency. Taiwan needs the most updated information without delay. That is why I cosponsored HR 353. https://t.co/2g5FkGJpJh,2020-02-03 21:46:26,Twitter Web App,997,1478,corona;
