The Trump Administration turned a COVID vaccine around in record time. Give credit where credit is due. This is leadership.   Meanwhile all of Biden’s plans for combatting COVID are exactly the same as what President @realDonaldTrump is already doing.,2020-11-24 17:37:00,TweetDeck,15,67,covid; 
Even though the media hates to admit it Trump’s COVID Task Force has been working hard—and the end is insight.   https://t.co/KXF3xIMRGr,2020-11-23 22:05:00,TweetDeck,3,18,covid;

Coronavirus is no one’s fault but China’s. President Trump shut the border down ASAP. Beijing Biden and Queen Nancy called Trump a xenophobic racist.,2020-10-23 01:26:00,TweetDeck,8,47,corona; 
Let’s look at the record. Biden’s handling of H1N1 vs Trump’s handling of Covid is a night and day difference. Biden didn’t lead through H1N1 and he can’t lead through Covid.,2020-10-23 01:20:00,TweetDeck,7,36,covid; 
Gov. Parson contracted COVID and the media is insinuating it’s due to his mask policy. Meanwhile Gov. Northam — a huge supporter of mandatory masks —  tested positive for COVID and it’s no one’s fault. This media bias is divisive and outrageous.,2020-09-25 23:35:00,TweetDeck,23,71,covid; 
The Pentagon is watching China closely. COVID-19 started there the People's Party knew it was dangerous our President acted quickly China's failures brought world economies to a screeching halt — and here they are meddling again. It's time to hold China accountable.,2020-06-25 20:15:00,TweetDeck,656,787,covid; 
Incredible work from Missouri’s 4H members! Despite fundraising suspensions due to COVID-19 they’ve successfully raised over 250000 meals for those in need across our state.   https://t.co/Q0VydXdYBz,2020-06-10 19:15:00,TweetDeck,7,13,covid; 
China reporting “0 new coronavirus cases” is as reliable as their first public statements about it. We cannot trust their reports. Period.,2020-05-29 15:32:00,TweetDeck,8,27,corona; 
Missouri is sending a clear message - China owes us all for their lies and deceit over this disease. They need to be held accountable for covering up the truth about COVID-19 which led to its mass spread. https://t.co/bRsP1CzHVz,2020-04-23 02:04:10,Twitter for iPhone,681,808,covid;

Let me be very clear: COVID-19 originated in the Chinese city Wuhan. Period. Full stop. Now a motley crew of bad actors (China Russia and Iran) are trying to say otherwise. Ridiculous.  https://t.co/IOK3xj9a93,2020-04-09 16:10:00,TweetDeck,137,201,covid;

Trump and his team have been taking action since the moment the danger of COVID-19 came to light. It began by ending flights to and from infected areas and continued with guidance on health measures and lifting regulations holding back the FDA. 1/2,2020-03-28 20:33:39,Twitter Web App,9,33,covid; 
When Senators should have been coming together the Ds were playing politics. They pushed ludicrous measures that have absolutely nothing to do with COVID-19 relief &amp; the MSM let them get away with it! Enough is enough. Pelosi Schumer &amp; all you crooks - DO YOUR JOB.,2020-03-26 15:20:00,TweetDeck,9,37,covid; 
We must never forget: China is a bad actor. They don't play be the same rules we do and they don't want to. Look at how they handled COVID-19 - in secrecy silencing most who dared to speak. China should have been transparent from the start. https://t.co/wswI8Wyr2D,2020-03-25 20:09:00,TweetDeck,712,839,covid;
