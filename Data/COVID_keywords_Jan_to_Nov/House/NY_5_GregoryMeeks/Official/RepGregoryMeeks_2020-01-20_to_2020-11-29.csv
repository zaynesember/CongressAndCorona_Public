If the Trump administration had a platform or plan on managing COVID - which 9 months in they still don't - its apparently to root out anyone with any competence or public trust. https://t.co/XFRtWnHAZC,2020-11-02 19:14:14,Twitter Web App,3,5,covid; 
Trumps tax returns are around the corner just like his healthcare plan or his COVID one. #PresidentialDebate2020 https://t.co/5A05bhPJdq,2020-10-23 01:35:40,Twitter for iPhone,8,49,covid; 
And that's with social distancing. Trump is back to likening COVID to the flu and endangering anyone who will listen. https://t.co/6w63taAhDx,2020-10-06 14:02:12,Twitter for Android,5,9,covid; 
Its this mentality that put Trump in the hospital in the first place and promoted a culture of skepticism that has exposed countless people to contracting COVID.  Remember Americans do not have the luxury of access to the top doctors/ experimental treatments that he's had. https://t.co/ndhbI67Zvp,2020-10-05 19:10:17,Twitter Web App,8,15,covid; 
CDFIs MDIs have supported low income and minority communities most devastated by COVID. But they’re disappearing at an alarming rate leaving families and businesses vulnerable to predatory lending. Grateful for the bipartisan support for my bill to help these institutions. https://t.co/704TEFDJQg,2020-09-21 21:06:52,Twitter Media Studio,4,9,covid; 
Says a lot that Republicans won't put aid for states and localities in their COVID relief bill but they'll let Trump twist federal agencies into playing out his inane politics threatening funding when people need it most.   This would be funny if it wasn't downright dangerous. https://t.co/ZswbJBh6fq,2020-09-21 18:53:42,Twitter Web App,4,9,covid; 
This administration's focus wasn't overcoming COVID it's focus was convincing the public the crisis wasn't happening. They allowed the pandemic to fester and as a result we are the coronavirus capital of the world. https://t.co/nGPWWwal9X,2020-09-17 22:35:12,Twitter for Android,3,6,covid; corona; 
Trump downplayed COVID refused to lead a response and fueled a skepticism about the virus that allowed it to spiral out of control. Countless lives have been lost our economy's in shambles and we have the tapes to show he knew the danger all along and did worse than nothing. https://t.co/lXdIfMRT9S,2020-09-09 18:02:43,Twitter Web App,4,6,covid; 
On #LaborDay we remember the hard fought victories that secured a livable wage a 5 day work week family leave and all that we sometimes take for granted. But this year let’s reflect on the many inequities highlighted by COVID and create opportunities for all American workers.,2020-09-07 18:20:18,Twitter for iPhone,9,17,covid; 
As if this administration hasn't failed Americans enough with a lack of COVID strategy costing more lives and economic damage than necessary now they're pulling back on testing.  Trump's focus is sweeping the pandemic under the rug putting PR over people. https://t.co/OUIJlqo2SP,2020-08-26 18:59:19,Twitter Web App,1,5,covid; 
This is the result of the administration's failure to lead during a pandemic and yet another example of the United State's diminishing role as a global leader.  But more than costing us our nation's reputation Trump's  has cost us invaluable time to get COVID-19 under control. https://t.co/3CVtiyUtID,2020-06-30 17:48:35,Twitter Web App,1,8,covid; 
Our ports railways bridges and tunnels are critical to our economy as well as the thousands of jobs these projects generate. We cannot allow the losses caused by the coronavirus pandemic to derail our transportation system.  https://t.co/sOYGLuujah,2020-06-12 15:48:55,Twitter for Android,1,3,corona; 
No question federal assistance for the Port Authority is critical for the functioning of our region's economy now and after this crisis. The drop in revenue caused by COVID-19 must be mitigated immediately through federal aid. https://t.co/LSSQOojb88,2020-05-21 20:37:13,Twitter Web App,6,11,covid;

Kushner has zero experience and should not be at the helm of this administration's coronavirus response. It takes a great deal of arrogance to discount expertise in times of crisis let alone when you're already so ill-equipped to execute on these responsibilities. https://t.co/8MAmScLBKn,2020-05-05 17:17:02,Twitter Web App,1,6,corona;

This is an absurd attempt to scapegoat and rewrite history. This administration was briefed by its own intelligence about coronavirus and ignored the ugly truth for political reasons. Cutting funding to the WHO doesn't erase that it just makes a global pandemic worse. https://t.co/BSZdnZrZgX,2020-04-14 22:41:19,Twitter Web App,10,17,corona; 
Structural inequities that have existed for small businesses long before COVID is now hurting their ability to receive aid. Dems are working to make sure they don't slip through the cracks.   That isn't hostage taking that's called negotiation. Read: https://t.co/RLW1CvWKF4,2020-04-13 17:28:07,Twitter Web App,6,11,covid; 
This administration's response is not commensurate to the state of the crisis in New York and across the United States. They continue to drag their feet and downplay the realities of coronavirus while those on the ground continue raising the alarm. https://t.co/BbusGDMVyn,2020-04-07 17:26:12,Twitter Media Studio,5,12,corona; 
Today I will cast my vote in DC to pass the $2 trillion coronavirus relief package.

Coronavirus response and precautions will inevitably complicate the Census campaign on the ground which is vital for an accurate count. It’s only reasonable to receive an extension for the 2020 Census so we have better data.   We only do this every ten years; let’s do it right. https://t.co/876yzPtKhQ,2020-03-12 21:47:13,Twitter for iPhone,7,11,corona; 
It's in everyone’s interest that coronavirus testing is made available and free that families can take emergency sick leave and that government is able to quickly respond to the public's needs.
