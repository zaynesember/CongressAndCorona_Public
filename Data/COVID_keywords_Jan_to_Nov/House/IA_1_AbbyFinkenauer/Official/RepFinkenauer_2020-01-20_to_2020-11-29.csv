I can’t stress enough how disappointed I am that biofuels were denied aid from @USDA — but I'm proud to join Sec. Vilsack and Lt. Gov. Judge in the fight to support our growers &amp; producers. I’ll demand assistance in any new COVID-19 aid package. #IA01 https://t.co/XQhVEYOp0H,2020-05-03 17:53:16,Twitter for iPhone,15,54,covid;

Our ag economy has been hit especially hard by this crisis — and so far received inadequate help from the administration. Our next package must include more help for producers who have lost markets due to coronavirus as well as targeted assistance for biofuels producers. #IA01,2020-04-28 18:44:55,Twitter Web App,3,14,corona; 
Today I released my priorities for the next coronavirus relief package. With our families and communities still hurting we must come together to provide additional aid and slow the spread of COVID-19 https://t.co/2O6l8Z0CG1 #IA01,2020-04-28 18:44:53,Twitter Web App,6,14,covid; corona; 
I’m happy to see @USDA and @CDCgov taking important steps to help our livestock producers and essential workers as we fight the COVID-19 pandemic and outbreaks at our processing plants. #IA01,2020-04-27 17:51:33,Twitter Web App,4,13,covid; 
On Monday @USDA announced $19B in Coronavirus aid — but not a penny for biofuels. Now CR is losing an ethanol plant furloughing 90 workers &amp; cutting off an essential market for farmers. We must support producers &amp; keep the Midwestern economy strong. #IA01 https://t.co/V7DILySpdd,2020-04-23 23:30:28,Twitter Web App,21,47,corona; 
Why are colleges &amp; universities being left behind on emergency COVID-19 payments? We’ve learned it’s because @usedgov didn’t do its job.  Less than 1% of the aid has actually been sent. This is unacceptable &amp; @RepPorter and I are urging the Dept. of Ed. to fix this problem #IA01,2020-04-21 17:36:04,Twitter Web App,31,129,covid; 
Our farmers and producers need all the help they can get amid the coronavirus pandemic and Trump’s ongoing trade war — but any aid package that leaves out support for biofuels is inadequate and unacceptable. We must do better than this. #IA01 https://t.co/xM1lJmAI8Y,2020-04-20 20:02:54,Twitter for iPhone,6,7,corona; 
Essential workers in Iowa and across the country are facing shortages of the protective gear they need in the fight against COVID-19. It's time for the president to use his authority to produce more live-saving PPE. #IA01 https://t.co/Xm3faehYjk,2020-04-16 16:09:48,Twitter Web App,16,44,covid; 
Head Start programs in Marshalltown will receive a $1.7 mil. grant as part of the CARES Act the COVID-19 relief bill we passed. Preparing the youngest in our community to learn and thrive is a top priority even as we continue battling this pandemic. #IA01 https://t.co/dHy5S68dr1,2020-04-13 16:37:55,Twitter for iPhone,3,17,covid;

Re-opening ACA marketplaces and allowing uninsured Iowans to enroll in health plans could save lives and ensure financial security during the coronavirus pandemic. I sent a letter to HHS Sec. Azar encouraging the Administration to reconsider this misguided decision. #IA01 https://t.co/1j9rDeRB98,2020-04-02 00:32:24,Twitter for iPhone,36,92,corona;

If hard-working families need to stay home because of coronavirus they shouldn't have to stress about taking a devastating financial hit. That's why we fought for this bill and we'll keep fighting to protect Iowans. #IA01 https://t.co/FyHGTGba91,2020-03-14 05:33:24,Twitter for iPhone,4,30,corona;

I voted today to put money into research for coronavirus vaccines and treatments. Also this package will help ensure our local health agencies have the resources they need to handle a response.
