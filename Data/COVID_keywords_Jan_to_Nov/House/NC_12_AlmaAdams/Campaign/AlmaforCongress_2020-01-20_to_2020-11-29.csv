“I take full responsibility.”  President Trump finally admits his failure on COVID. #Debates2020,2020-10-23 01:17:53,Twitter for iPhone,1,5,covid; 
He’s known about COVID since January. He has no clear plan. 220000 Americans are dead. He has no business being president. #Debates2020,2020-10-23 01:13:20,Twitter for iPhone,1,5,covid;

This election comes down to one question: Who is on your side?  After tonight the choice couldn’t be clearer.  President Trump isn't worried about us. He isn’t worried about COVID victims. He's worried about himself.   Joe Biden is on our side. He’s who we need. #Debates2020,2020-09-30 02:57:59,Twitter for iPhone,2,5,covid; 
President Trump​ knowingly and willingly lied to the American people about the threat COVID posed to our country. For months.  He panicked.  He didn’t have a plan then and he made clear tonight – more than six months into the pandemic – that he still has no plan. #Debates2020,2020-09-30 02:54:56,Twitter for iPhone,2,3,covid; 
Trump’s poor planning has also led to 200000 deaths from COVID-19: an absolutely unacceptable number.   Regardless of what he says about his plan one thing’s for sure: @realDonaldTrump doesn’t care about your health. Actions speak louder than words.,2020-09-24 21:48:01,Twitter for iPhone,2,5,covid;

The Coronavirus has killed enough Americans to fill Bank of America Stadium and the Spectrum Center. COVID-19 isn’t a partisan issue: it’s a life and death issue. Right now we don’t need a photo opp; we need protective equipment and protections for workers.,2020-05-21 20:28:49,Twitter for iPhone,5,13,covid; corona;
