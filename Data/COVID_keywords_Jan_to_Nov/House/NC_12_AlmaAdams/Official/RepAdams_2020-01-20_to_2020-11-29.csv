People are losing work pay and jobs due to coronavirus. No one should have to go hungry or lose their shelter due to this crisis.

The coronavirus is a life or death crisis not a partisan crisis. That is why I have asked the leaders of the #NCGA to convene a special session and pass legislation that will provide immediate relief to NC families and mitigate the health and economic effects of the coronavirus. https://t.co/k8WGrPf0yy,2020-03-12 20:43:42,Twitter Web App,12,35,corona;

President Trump has taken his negligence to a new level.
