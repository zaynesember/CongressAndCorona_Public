COVID-19 is one of the greatest challenges we’ve ever faced. I’m grateful for the dedication of frontline healthcare workers like Reps. @YadiraCaraveo &amp; @Kyle_Mullica. Thanks for sharing your experiences with me. Together we can fight to get our communities the resources we need. https://t.co/1edcB8iX44,2020-10-17 00:10:00,Twitter Web App,7,34,covid; 
Thanks to @JEWISHco for inviting me to the 2020 Candidates Forum. We had a great convo about issues that matter most to Coloradans -- from healthcare &amp; COVID-19 relief to ensuring our elections are safe &amp; secure. Make your voice heard this election &amp; vote! https://t.co/vB2QiTsMZh,2020-10-15 20:18:36,Twitter Web App,8,16,covid; 
I’ve been hearing from Coloradans in CD6 about how COVID-19 has upended their lives. That’s why I’m fighting in Congress for more support for our small businesses funding for testing and contact tracing and PPE for our first responders. https://t.co/sAAuk9Okpi,2020-09-23 00:43:42,Twitter Web App,158,256,covid; 
Jared Kushner has been going on TV to vouch for Trump’s COVID-19 response but I don’t know under what scenario Kushner has credibility left in this debate.  We need a President who won't downplay the facts &amp; strong leadership in the White House to guide us out of this crisis. https://t.co/sfD5VUmEyk,2020-09-16 16:41:13,Twitter Web App,211,528,covid;

It is time that we had a fighter in the Senate who will support Coloradans - not play politics with people’s lives.  Thanks to @Hickenlooper for inviting me to join today's roundtable on COVID-19 relief.

We need to rapidly build up our public health workforce. The first step is making sure we have the people in place to address this crisis. I’m proud to introduce a bill to create a Health Force to train and employ Americans to respond to COVID-19.  https://t.co/UqTE1fYWoK https://t.co/Z8xQp5MDaL,2020-05-12 18:29:49,Gain Platform,17,50,covid;

Proud to join @RobinLynneKelly @BLeeForCongress @AyannaPressley and @KarenBassTweets in calling on the CDC to release racial &amp; ethnic data on COVID-19.
