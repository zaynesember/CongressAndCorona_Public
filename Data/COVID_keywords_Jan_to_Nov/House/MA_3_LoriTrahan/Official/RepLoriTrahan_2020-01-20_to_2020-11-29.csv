Cases are rising. Hospitalizations are rising. Deaths are rising.   Yet @SenateMajLdr and Republican Senators are willing to let #COVID19 benefits expire when families will need them most.   Calling this heartless would be an understatement. https://t.co/m9Kfc8qGKF,2020-11-22 18:39:30,Twitter for iPhone,6,26,covid; 
Economists agree: Our job market will look completely different for the foreseeable future because of #COVID19.  We need solutions at the federal level to get people back to work in family-sustaining jobs.

President Trump and Mitch McConnell are throwing a party at the White House tonight while millions of American families are on the brink of being evicted or going hungry.

Here’s why Mitch McConnell’s opposition to additional #COVID19 relief makes no sense:  Our unemployment rate is 7.9% (twice what it was in February) and many workers are leaving the workforce for good.

The House’s new #COVID19 relief package: ✔️Direct payments ✔️Funding for testing tracing &amp; treatment ✔️Food security &amp; housing assistance ✔️School &amp; child care investments   If that sounds familiar it should.
