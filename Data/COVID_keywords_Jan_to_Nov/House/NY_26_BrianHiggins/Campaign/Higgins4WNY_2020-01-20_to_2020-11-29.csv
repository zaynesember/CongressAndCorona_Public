One year ago @JoeBiden said that our country was not ready for a public health risk like COVID-19. Under this President’s failed leadership our country now faces the biggest case counts since the outbreak began. It didn’t have to be this bad. #vote https://t.co/unMm9vLrte,2020-10-25 13:48:34,Twitter for iPhone,2,3,covid; 
This President doesn’t acknowledge that our frontline workers are essential to fight COVID-19. We need to get out there and get #soulstothepolls to elect @joebiden to help our country overcome the biggest health crisis we have faced in a century. #voteearlyday https://t.co/TcLC2Gd5df,2020-10-24 18:00:49,Twitter for iPhone,0,3,covid; 
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic voting by absentee ballot is a safe way to vote if you don't feel comfortable going to the polls. You can request an absentee ballot for the general election easily online. https://t.co/6KfxyGntpR,2020-08-26 16:01:11,Twitter for iPhone,1,2,covid;

It’s unacceptable that 4 months into the #COVID19 pandemic we still face #ppe shortages and testing result delays and appalling that Trump calls testing “overrated.”,2020-07-23 19:25:52,Twitter for iPhone,1,2,covid; 
#COVID19 is impacting every aspect of our lives including elections. This is a defining moment in protecting our right to vote. @MoveOn is right: Congress must support $4B to increase access to voter registration expand early voting and allow all Americans to #VoteByMail https://t.co/cBlcvB6DH5,2020-04-13 18:37:47,Twitter for iPhone,5,7,covid;
