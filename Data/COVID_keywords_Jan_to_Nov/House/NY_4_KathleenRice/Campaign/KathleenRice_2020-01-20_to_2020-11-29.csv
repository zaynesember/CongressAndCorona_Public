The hardworking men and women of @NALC_National  have always worked tirelessly to keep our communities connected. And that's been especially true during the COVID-19 pandemic. I'm so proud to have their endorsement and will always stand with them in Washington. #NY04 https://t.co/tejDAUDM4W,2020-10-19 17:31:19,Twitter Web App,2,7,covid; 
Grocery store workers have been on the frontline of the COVID-19 outbreak since it started. They've kept our community going and deserve hazard pay until this crisis ends. Join me in calling on @StopandShop to extend hazard pay for these brave men &amp; women. https://t.co/HSmDC4pjr9,2020-07-08 19:51:56,Twitter Web App,3,9,covid; 
Honored to receive the endorsement of @1199SEIU. I'm always grateful to have the support of our allies in labor especially those on the frontline in our fight against COVID-19. These hard-working men and women never stop fighting for us and I'll never stop fighting for them. https://t.co/muxVgpTzrW,2020-06-15 16:49:25,Twitter Web App,2,6,covid; 
6 weeks ago we launched a virtual food drive to support @LongIslandCares' COVID response. We set out to raise 5000 lbs of goods. As our drive comes to a close today we've raised more than 15000.  I'm so grateful to everyone who chipped in. It made a real difference! Thank you! https://t.co/BvyHjRXr41,2020-06-01 23:02:15,Twitter Web App,4,14,covid; 
Take a look at my top priorities as your Representative in Congress. I'm honored to be your voice in Washington and look forward to continuing to fight for our district in 2020 and beyond especially as we work to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. #NY04 https://t.co/tLL70a3yA0,2020-05-28 16:37:10,Twitter Web App,1,5,covid; 
The COVID-19 crisis has created unprecedented food insecurity across LI. And @LongIslandCares is doing everything they can to support those in need. But they can't do it alone. If you can donate to my virtual food drive to help keep their shelves stocked: https://t.co/9HOJ68CLa8 https://t.co/T9o3qriDfN,2020-05-26 21:11:24,Twitter Web App,2,5,covid; 
Last month we started a virtual food drive to help families who have been affected by the coronavirus outbreak. Since then you all have helped us donate 7500 pounds of good to @LongIslandCares! But we still have one more week before our food drive ends! https://t.co/cp4DPrY6OW,2020-05-23 15:20:07,Twitter Web App,1,2,corona;
