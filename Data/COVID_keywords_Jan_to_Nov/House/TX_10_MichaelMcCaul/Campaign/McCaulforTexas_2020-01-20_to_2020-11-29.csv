#TX10: @SiegelForTexas is too busy criticizing the United States to denounce the CCP for covering up the coronavirus outbreak and allowing a regional epidemic to become a global pandemic. https://t.co/zYFTKxys6I https://t.co/SP9KRKYBCa,2020-09-22 13:59:31,Twitter Web App,1,1,corona; 
The CCP is America's top national security &amp; economic threat. The CCP is guilty of covering up the COVID outbreak abusing human rights engaging in military aggression &amp; ripping off American workers &amp; businesses. What does @SiegelForTexas say about any of this? Nothing. #TX10 https://t.co/dd6yEjxIdt,2020-08-19 15:57:20,Twitter Web App,4,15,covid; 
#TX10: @SiegelForTexas called Speaker Pelosi a "tremendous leader" -- the same Speaker who delays COVID relief every time she doesn't get her exact partisan wishlist. Republicans asked for a temporary extension of unemployment while negotiations continued &amp; Pelosi walked.,2020-08-03 19:46:40,Twitter Web App,2,5,covid; 
Americans have lost jobs as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. Instead of helping these Americans looking for work @SiegelforTexas would raise middle class taxes and then give taxpayer money to illegal immigrants and people “unwilling to work.” #TX10,2020-07-31 15:22:27,Twitter Web App,1,5,corona; 
The China Task Force's report on the origins of the coronavirus outbreak went viral in China. Now the Chinese Communist Party's propaganda outlets are attacking me and the China Task Force. That means we're winning. -MTM #TX10 https://t.co/WuDXgC3Vxn,2020-07-25 16:49:08,Twitter Web App,3,6,corona; 
The Chinese Communist Party's greatest fear is losing its hold on power. It's why they covered up their monumental failure to contain COVID. It's why they don't allow free speech. It's why they are trying to take over Hong Kong. It's why they try to bully Taiwan. https://t.co/gwczddanx7,2020-07-09 20:33:12,Twitter Web App,333,364,covid; 
We will get through this hard time and be stronger than ever.

The report I released on the origins of the coronavirus reads like an indictment of the Chinese Communist Party. The CCP covered up the spread of the virus allowing it to become a global pandemic. It should have been contained but the CCP refused to be honest with the world. https://t.co/ubWq2ENMIV,2020-07-02 18:57:24,Twitter Web App,642,678,corona; 
While American scientists are working to develop a life-saving vaccine to rescue the world from coronavirus the CCP is trying to steal that research for their own selfish purposes.   Congress has to be united in condemning these cyberattacks.  https://t.co/C7aywAO9ZU,2020-07-02 00:12:14,Twitter Web App,5,7,corona; 
Speaker Pelosi delayed talks on COVID-19 relief twice. When it came time for her next bill the Speaker chose not to negotiate at all. She crafted 1800 pages and $3T worth of spending w/ ZERO GOP input. It needs to be bipartisan &amp; needs to address bringing jobs back to the USA. https://t.co/rflnKA1bkl,2020-06-17 19:29:25,Twitter for iPhone,2,6,covid; 
With 36M Americans unemployed due to the COVID19 outbreak Congress needs to debate real bipartisan solutions to help Americans. Pelosi's $3 TRILLION bill is 1800 pages of partisan wish list items that don't solve the daily problems facing American citizens and businesses.,2020-05-15 18:41:52,Twitter Web App,3,4,covid; 
As Chairman of the #ChinaTaskForce I'm working w/ colleagues to:  1⃣ Hold the Chinese Communist Party accountable for its cover-up of COVID19  2⃣ Detail plans for the USA to outcompete the CCP economically.

2003- CCP didn't properly alert world to SARS causing a pandemic.

Coronavirus has caused economic devastation across Texas and America. Now some are hijacking this crisis to push a job-killing Green New Deal that abolishes oil and gas.
