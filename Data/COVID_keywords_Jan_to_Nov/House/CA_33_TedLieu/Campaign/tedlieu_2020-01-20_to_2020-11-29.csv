This is what happens when @CIA assesses Russia paid Taliban to kill US troops and @realDonaldTrump does nothing. It encourages further Russian aggression.

Dear @realDonaldTrump: Americans are not showing up at hospitals because they got a positive #COVID19 test.

Physically reopening schools is a worthy goal. But we must not repeat the mistakes of countries like S Korea &amp; Israel which reopened schools then shut them down and are trying again.

Dear @realDonaldTrump: You can’t force local schools to reopen. But you can help them try to reopen by signing the HEROES Act. Schools need PPE reduced class sizes &amp; online learning as a backup.

Dear @realDonaldTrump: You are so freakin’ stupid. Testing is what allows people to take action to stop the spread of #COVID19. You are killing Americans with your ignorant anti-science statements and policies.  And you’re a hypocrite.

Why so many empty seats at the #TrumpsCoronavirusRally?  A. Seeing @POTUS is not worth dying  B. @realDonaldTrump’s base shrank so much they can’t even fill an arena in a red state  C.

You can pin the abject failure of our country’s response to #COVID__19 on @realDonaldTrump. He never tried to do national testing or contact tracing. He discourages mask wearing. He attacks medical experts. And now he’s going to do a #Coronapalooza in Tulsa. Absolutely INSANE. https://t.co/90Py8ddhuk,2020-06-20 00:01:01,Twitter for iPhone,2922,8316,covid; corona;

We know that the highest transmission places for #COVID19 are indoor areas where people are close together for long periods of time especially if they don’t wear masks.  @realDonaldTrump’s indoor Tulsa rally will make a number of participants sick including possible death. https://t.co/LWhOrqcrmO,2020-06-19 21:38:35,Twitter for iPhone,800,2842,covid; 
Here’s a simple question. How do you think #COVID19 spreads? Answer: respiratory droplets from coughing sneezing or talking.  What’s one way to stop spreading respiratory droplets? Masks. Wearing masks is not a political issue. It’s a health issue.   https://t.co/Vrd8dTR4Yu,2020-06-19 07:30:22,Twitter for iPhone,1676,5500,covid; 
@BeckyJohnson222 @realDonaldTrump @Surgeon_General @CDCgov Do you think @CDCgov and @Surgeon_General are just making things up? Also there are multiple studies that show wearing masks reduces #COVID19 transmission.  https://t.co/Vrd8dTR4Yu,2020-06-19 06:36:04,Twitter for iPhone,6,23,covid; 
Dear CEOs: The @realDonaldTrump Administration’s @Surgeon_General &amp; @CDCgov say wear masks. Numerous studies show masks reduce #COVID19 transmission.

Dear @realDonaldTrump: You are full of BS about mask wearing somehow being about you. Your own @Surgeon_General &amp; @CDCgov tell Americans to wear masks in public.

Dear @realDonaldTrump &amp; @VP: Sticking your head in the sand won’t stop the pandemic. Whether or not you want to do testing people who have trouble breathing will still go to the hospital.

Dear @realDonaldTrump: You are really stupid. If we stop testing there would be even more cases of people who go to the hospital because they are gasping for air. And even more thousands of Americans per week will die because they can’t breathe as a result of #Covid_19. Get it? https://t.co/JirvNXQDMK,2020-06-15 20:52:38,Twitter for iPhone,3160,12207,covid;

The long and boring West Point speech by @realDonaldTrump could just as easily have been done by video.  @POTUS made a reckless decision to force over 1100 cadets to go back for an in-person graduation to a #COVID19 hot spot state in violation of New York’s mass gatherings order. https://t.co/yuW4I4FW5s,2020-06-13 16:03:14,Twitter for iPhone,5372,17246,covid;

Perhaps @realDonaldTrump is now tightly hugging Confederate names &amp; symbols to help him win key demographic groups. Wait what?

Turns out the strategy of @realDonaldTrump of risking the lives of senior citizens by downplaying #Covid19 has not gone over well with senior citizens.   @POTUS disrespects the elderly when he refuses to wear a mask lies about the virus and suggests injecting bleach into people. https://t.co/Hpx9WVUmwg,2020-06-11 06:33:11,Twitter for iPhone,2143,7299,covid; 
You should have a Snickers bar or Ben &amp; Jerry’s ice cream today. Why? Because they have the same effect on #COVID19 as #Hydroxychloroquine which is nothing.

Two reasons over 101000 Americans died from #COVID19.  1. @realDonaldTrump &amp; his Administration reject science when it conflicts with their political agenda.  2.

@GM062616 @RepClayHiggins Wrong. Both the Trump Administration’s Surgeon General &amp; CDC urge Americans to wear masks in public. The issue is stopping your saliva droplets.

@keithccurtis @ScottGottliebMD The multiple large studies on hydroxychloroquine show it doesn’t work on Covid19 &amp; it can be dangerous. Most people with Covid recover.

Dear @realDonaldTrump: Your magical thinking &amp; downplaying of the virus has led to over 61000 American deaths from #COVID19. Please learn from your mistakes. Saying the virus is gonna leave doesn’t make it go away. But more testing &amp; PPE would help stop its spread.

Dear @SECNAV Modly: Capt. Crozier warned the Navy that #Covid_19 was spreading through the ship. He was protecting his personnel. The fact that you got embarrassed is not a valid reason to relieve him of command.

It’s possible hydroxychloroquine helps #Covid_19 patients. It’s also possible if you gave them grape juice or a placebo you would get similar results. Without controlled studies we really have no idea.

It is a scientific fact that #Covid_19 can spread through large gatherings of people.

Today @RubenGallego &amp; I sent a letter to @DoD_IG requesting an investigation of @SECNAV Modly.

Dear @realDonaldTrump: Dr. Fauci said 15% of people infected with #COVID19 get so sick they have to be hospitalized. That’s a huge number. And if they need a ventilator &amp; can’t get one they die.

Dr. Fauci said 15% of people who contract #COVID19 get so very sick they have to be hospitalized. A recent article shows 38% were age 54 or under.

At the beginning of March the US had 70 #COVIDー19 cases. Now it’s over 42k. By end of March we will have over 100k if social distancing didn’t work.

Dear @realDonaldTrump: The reason we now have approximately 40000 cases of #COVIDー19 is because the virus didn’t primarily come through our borders with Mexico or Canada.

Dear @realDonaldTrump: I agree with you we are at war with a hidden enemy #COVID19. You’ve likened yourself to a wartime president. We need the ammo to fight #coronavirus.

Dear @WhiteHouse: This virus has an official name Covid-19 and an unofficial name Coronavirus. Your language will cause more discrimination against Asian Americans.

I urge everyone to read the Imperial College study on #COVID19 &amp; this thread below which summarizes it. Upshot is we will need to sustain Americans for a year or more until we get a validated vaccine. Stimulus plan by @realDonaldTrump is way too small.

At beginning of March we had around 70 #COVID2019 cases. Today it’s over 5000 because the virus spreads exponentially. Based on math number of cases will exceed 100000 by end of March IF we don’t do any social distancing. This is why everyone needs to do social distancing. https://t.co/CVVPu0JBwc,2020-03-18 01:32:45,Twitter for iPhone,1845,4618,covid; 
More evidence below of why we need a bigger and longer stimulus plan from @realDonaldTrump. #Coronavirus is not a weeks-long crisis. It’s a year-long crisis until we get a vaccine. I will be pushing in Congress for a stimulus plan that can sustain Americans for at least a year. https://t.co/FWVikfakFE,2020-03-18 00:03:54,Twitter for iPhone,1335,4143,corona; 
Why do we need a stimulus plan that sustains Americans for a year? Because “silent spreaders” will cause #coronavirus to spike again once social distancing stops. Only way to solve this is a vaccine which is 1 year away. We need to think about this as a year-long crisis. https://t.co/ii9RMGQeMS,2020-03-17 23:31:24,Twitter for iPhone,1296,3873,corona; 
I agree with @realDonaldTrump #coronavirus is a hidden enemy. Best way to find it? Testing. This is why we need to dramatically increase the currently insufficient testing. We also need to work with other countries such as China to solve the testing reagent shortage. https://t.co/z3frdZxOxO,2020-03-17 21:16:06,Twitter for iPhone,966,4861,corona; 
I look forward to working with @WhiteHouse on a stimulus plan. Need to emphasize again that the Administration’s plan is too small. Because there is no immunity to #COVID2019 this crisis will not go away in weeks. We need to reorient to a time period of many months to a year. https://t.co/TZUudj9eo9,2020-03-17 19:08:26,Twitter for iPhone,306,1218,covid; 
A good explanation of why we must take strong social distancing actions. But one upshot is that because there is no immunity #COVID2019 will spike again if these actions go away. We need to stop thinking about this crisis in terms of weeks. We need to reorient to months or more. https://t.co/hBsyq11Gpx,2020-03-17 18:31:13,Twitter for iPhone,443,1033,covid; 
Dear @WhiteHouse: We are in an unprecedented health crisis. All Americans are at risk from #coronavirus which does not discriminate. The next few months will be very difficult for our nation. Please stop your bigotry. It is not helpful. We all need to work together. https://t.co/Bb92pULMTX,2020-03-17 15:57:18,Twitter for iPhone,1242,4569,corona; 
The spread of #COVID2019 in America has been exponential just like the experts predicted. Current mortality rate of #coronavirus is more than 10 times that of the flu just like the experts predicted.  Please listen to experts like Dr. Fauci at @NIH and do social distancing NOW. https://t.co/Y1tdz9mF6s,2020-03-17 06:27:14,Twitter for iPhone,2023,5558,covid; corona; 
Dear @realDonaldTrump: Please use your powers under the Defense Production Act to start producing medical equipment to fight #coronavirus. Here again is our letter to you led by @RepAndyLevin. https://t.co/P7GCjiSK2x https://t.co/SOvrXzSc0h,2020-03-17 04:04:48,Twitter for iPhone,3404,8616,corona; 
We will have ample time later to examine Fox News’ role during this #coronavirus crisis. I’m pleased they are changing their tune. Right now we need all Americans including #MAGA folks and those who watch @seanhannity to engage in social distancing NOW. Lives are at stake. https://t.co/JyPZfqVG4T,2020-03-17 03:19:19,Twitter for iPhone,1225,4842,corona;
