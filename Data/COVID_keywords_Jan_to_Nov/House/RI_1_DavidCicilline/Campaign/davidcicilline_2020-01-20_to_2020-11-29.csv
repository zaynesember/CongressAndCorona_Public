Today is #NationalFirstRespondersDay - I’m grateful for the sacrifices they make every day.

The White House just put out a list of “First Term Accomplishments.”   Among them is “Ending the COVID-19 Pandemic.”  In the real world 226000 Americans died. 50000 are in the hospital. We’ve had half a million new cases this week! We can’t let this president get a 2nd term.,2020-10-27 20:27:08,Twitter for iPhone,338,1100,covid; 
One year ago today long before COVID-19 appeared @JoeBiden warned us that President Trump wasn’t prepared for a pandemic.   But Donald Trump didn’t listen.   A President’s bad judgment does have consequences. https://t.co/jZXxmOJehw,2020-10-25 20:38:53,Twitter for iPad,91,341,covid;

The American people are hurting. I’m grateful that @speakerpelosi is leading the fight to pass another COVID-19 relief package. Mitch McConnell needs to get out of the way. https://t.co/asZGFLKdRh,2020-10-21 01:10:16,Twitter for iPhone,274,843,covid; 
200000 people dead. Millions out of work. But Republicans still won’t pass a COVID-19 relief package. Why?   They’ve got their hands full this week spreading Russian disinformation and jamming through another right wing Supreme Court justice.  America deserves better.,2020-10-15 13:59:14,Twitter for iPhone,275,687,covid;

50 days to go. Last night the President hosted another open mic night where he may have exposed thousands of Nevada voters to COVID-19.  Right now @JoeBiden is talking about a serious plan to confront the damage that’s been done to our environment. https://t.co/NBRQ35FLBC,2020-09-14 17:43:59,Twitter for iPhone,42,130,covid; 
The President knew how deadly COVID was. He kept holding rallies. He kept downplaying the risks. He ignored the experts.  It’s an unprecedented betrayal. Blood is on his hands.  If he had a shred of decency he’d resign. If Republicans had any integrity they’d demand it.,2020-09-09 23:04:16,Twitter for iPhone,541,1576,covid; 
Trump’s “America First” is really just “America Alone.” To not join the world in distributing a coronavirus vaccine is effectively flipping off the entire planet.  https://t.co/emY9WYXzXG,2020-09-01 19:10:01,Twitter for iPhone,736,1711,corona;

The President had the time to commute Roger Stone’s sentence today.   He still doesn’t have a COVID-19 strategy or a response to Putin putting bounties on American soldiers.,2020-07-10 23:59:36,Twitter for iPhone,734,2083,covid; 
That's it. That's the white flag. President Trump is surrendering to COVID-19 and telling the American people "You're on your own." https://t.co/ti5HrONy55,2020-07-07 20:53:28,Twitter Web App,243,807,covid; 
Why is Trump obsessed with eliminating DACA? Many of these Dreamers are on the front lines helping fight coronavirus while the president tweets about conspiracy theories from the White House. https://t.co/YaJVXVWnsM,2020-07-06 20:07:39,Twitter for iPhone,82,211,corona;
