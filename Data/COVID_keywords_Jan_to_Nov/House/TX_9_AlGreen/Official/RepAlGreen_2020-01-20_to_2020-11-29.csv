As Texas and other states see their highest numbers of #COVID19 cases the President asks #SCOTUS to invalidate the Affordable Care Act.

To whom it may concern  Decisions about going back to business as usual during a pandemic should be medical NOT political. We should rely on Dr. Fauci‘s medical expertise regarding #COVID19 NOT President Trump’s political whims. #NotDying4WallStreet,2020-03-24 17:37:59,Twitter for iPhone,363,1146,covid;

An impeached president who's been exposed to #coronavirus but does not get tested while encouraging others to be tested for the virus is worse than a bad example.

Mr. President blaming CNN for reporting news and Democratic politicians for speaking out is more propaganda than a plan when it comes to dealing with the coronavirus.
