While #COVIDー19 affects all of us it has a uniquely devastating impact on students.   Check out my report which features firsthand stories from students in #CA15 to learn more about how the coronavirus has changed the future for so many.   https://t.co/sVYdob3RmX,2020-3-24 19:06:05,Twitter for iPad,126,439,covid; corona; 
Please join me and @SteveLockhartMD for a Facebook Live town hall. We’ll answer all of your questions surrounding the #coronavirus outbreak. Tune in this Thursday March 26th here: https://t.co/oXQHO20nAK https://t.co/HMLy5FFiqs,2020-3-24 13:44:27,Twitter for iPhone,70,182,corona; 
The #coronavirus economy is in a freefall. Rent health care and payroll costs are coming due soon. Let’s unite to keep Americans out of quicksand. But can’t we do that without giving this guy a $500 billion slush fund for his friends? https://t.co/k7kwUTr64n,2020-3-23 0:23:29,Twitter for iPhone,5689,17220,corona; 
Want to help in a crisis? We have a blood shortage at our East Bay hospitals. Go to https://t.co/kRUpOJVAHM put in your zip code and find closest donation bank. We need you! #CoronaVirusUpdate,2020-3-20 23:06:24,Twitter for iPhone,167,285,corona; 
As we consider what #coronavirus stimulus looks like for America’s businesses my top priority will be to help the businesses who KEEP their employees. It’s not just about wages and benefits it’s the unmeasurable dignity of having your job.,2020-3-20 16:30:15,Twitter for iPhone,197,883,corona; 
I never served in war. Too many friends (like @RubenGallego) have. I don’t think @realDonaldTrump should compare #coronavirus to a war. We’re in this crisis together &amp; it’ll take a mobilization of resources. But let’s not diminish those who lost their lives on the battlefield.,2020-3-20 16:10:12,Twitter for iPhone,708,4414,corona; 
Attention building community: As the number of #COVID19 cases continue to rise in CA we are calling on you all to donate your available N95 masks.

Message to America’s CEOs: your businesses have been hit hard by #coronavirus. I want to help. But what you do next determines how Congress helps. Will you avoid layoffs &amp; share the pain w/ workers? Or will you leave people in the cold so those at the top survive? #DoWhatsRight,2020-3-18 3:14:10,Twitter for iPhone,4148,16235,corona; 
@weijia *Not serious about handling #coronavirus. Racist in general.,2020-3-17 15:33:52,Twitter for iPhone,455,10645,corona; 
Welcome back! Glad you’re healthy. Now go vote and pass the  House’s #FamiliesFirst bill that expands #coronavirus testing beyond just senators. https://t.co/ZMk5h4lwtF,2020-3-17 3:21:49,Twitter for iPhone,1759,10257,corona; 
We need physical distancing NOT democratic distancing. Governor show agility: Allow people to vote in waves over a longer period of time in smaller groups. Use it as a stimulus opportunity to hire poll workers who’ve lost jobs/hours to #coronavirus. And extend absentee voting. https://t.co/m3eRNPcykH,2020-3-17 3:01:40,Twitter for iPhone,2262,6923,corona; 
This Thursday March 19th I'll be joined by two renowned Bay Area public health experts for a live telephone town hall on #coronavirus. Head to my website or official Facebook for more details.  I hope you'll join us. https://t.co/OZOiQ7sasp,2020-3-16 20:23:49,Twitter Web App,127,407,corona; 
College students: I want to hear from you. If the #CoronavirusOutbreak has caused unplanned changes to your semester or quarter let me know. Share your story with my office at the link below.    We will get through this together. https://t.co/wkZahYZrrw,2020-3-16 13:47:15,Twitter for iPad,279,817,corona; 
I reject “social distancing.” As @brianstelter said on @CNN let’s instead practice “physical distancing” to beat #coronavirus. In meantime let’s keep our humanity and fire up FaceTime call friends &amp; maybe just maybe re-download @WordsWFriends. Challenge me at RepSwalwell.,2020-3-15 19:04:03,Twitter for iPhone,1136,7412,corona; 
If you worked at a supermarket or a pharmacy today thank you. A million. We need each other. #coronavirus,2020-3-15 3:17:55,Twitter for iPhone,13077,102700,corona; 
Do you think maybe you and the Senate should be in Washington voting on the @HouseDemocrats passed/@realDonaldTrump-supported #coronavirus stimulus? Enjoy your beer. https://t.co/Dab6AxWs3T,2020-3-14 21:34:16,Twitter for iPhone,9348,43215,corona; 
Millions of college students will be affected by #coronavirus leaving many homeless without food and farther in debt without credits to show for it. Share your story with me so I can be your voice as Congress seeks to help those in need. Share here: https://t.co/wkZahYHQ2W,2020-3-14 20:50:57,Twitter for iPhone,1092,3070,corona; 
When lawmakers refer to #COVIDー19 as a “Chinese” virus they are not only misleading the public about a disease with confirmed cases in over 100 countries they are stoking racism &amp; xenophobia in our communities. Diseases don’t have an ethnicity. Period. https://t.co/aytY5Jr76c,2020-3-13 17:56:17,Twitter Web App,1453,5610,covid; 
Every second @GOPLeader @senatemajldr &amp; @realDonaldTrump screw around with #coronavirus #FamiliesFirst funding more people will get sick some will die and the economy will sink further. Time to lead.,2020-3-13 14:59:41,Twitter for iPhone,2109,8475,corona; 
Every day @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP &amp; @SenateGOP delay a #coronavirus stimulus package people will get sicker and our economy weaker. Enough is enough. It’s time for free testing for all and sick leave for families affected. RT if you agree. #FamiliesFirst,2020-3-13 1:45:36,Twitter for iPhone,6043,10951,corona; 
The best way to protect yourself against #COVIDー19 is to stay informed. Check out my video below for the simple steps we can all take to help slow the spread of the virus. https://t.co/UTGrs64BaK,2020-3-12 22:36:17,Twitter Media Studio,592,2152,covid; 
My Securing Energy Critical Elements &amp; American Jobs Act just passed out of subcommittee on @HouseScience!   China’s rare earth exports have fallen by 17% due to coronavirus lowering our domestic supply of #energycriticalelements &amp; further underscoring the need for this bill. https://t.co/imxF9pdNCu,2020-3-12 15:40:51,Twitter Web App,59,210,corona; 
The President is making a major health care crisis worse. He must be sidelined and refrain from saying anything further about #coronavirus and allow @VP and Congress to work together to take action. Every word Trump unintelligently speaks puts more lives at risk.,2020-3-6 23:56:03,Twitter for iPhone,9613,41019,corona; 
No one should be turned away from coronavirus testing because of costs. I’m thrilled to see CA’s leadership &amp; dedication to protecting all residents regardless of income.  Remember: anyone showing signs of respiratory illness including fever should report these symptoms ASAP. https://t.co/0JvVwXDG2U,2020-3-6 17:28:51,Twitter Web App,1464,5666,corona; 
There are several confirmed cases of coronavirus in the Bay Area &amp; the lack of test kits available is shameful. While I am pleased that the House is working to pass an $8.3 billion emergency supplemental package we need swift action &amp; strong leadership from the White House now. https://t.co/jjx2NFMtt2,2020-3-4 20:01:06,Twitter Web App,721,2570,corona; 
Stop wearing face masks. #coronavirus,2020-3-4 6:04:27,Twitter for iPhone,3628,6344,corona; 
We cannot let the coronavirus stoke fear and discrimination against our Asian American neighbors in the East Bay and around the country. As we tackle this public health crisis let us do so with facts and science — not prejudice.,2020-3-3 16:23:37,Twitter Web App,230,1601,corona;

My office just received a call from a constituent who yelled “I’m not falling for the Democrat #coronavirus hoax.” President @realDonaldTrump it’s imperative people take this seriously. Your words are giving them the impression that it’s not serious. You must do better.,2020-3-2 18:37:07,Twitter for iPhone,16623,75998,corona;
