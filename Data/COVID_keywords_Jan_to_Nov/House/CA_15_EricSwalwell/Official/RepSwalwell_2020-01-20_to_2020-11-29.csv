As we consider what #coronavirus stimulus looks like for America’s businesses my top priority will be to help the businesses who KEEP their employees. It’s not just about wages and benefits it’s the unmeasurable dignity of having your job.,3/20/2020 16:30,Twitter for iPhone,197,883,corona; 
I never served in war. Too many friends (like @RubenGallego) have. I don’t think @realDonaldTrump should compare #coronavirus to a war. We’re in this crisis together &amp; it’ll take a mobilization of resources. But let’s not diminish those who lost their lives on the battlefield.,3/20/2020 16:10,Twitter for iPhone,708,4414,corona;

Message to America’s CEOs: your businesses have been hit hard by #coronavirus. I want to help. But what you do next determines how Congress helps. Will you avoid layoffs &amp; share the pain w/ workers? Or will you leave people in the cold so those at the top survive? #DoWhatsRight,3/18/2020 3:14,Twitter for iPhone,4148,16235,corona; 
@weijia *Not serious about handling #coronavirus. Racist in general.,3/17/2020 15:33,Twitter for iPhone,455,10645,corona; 
Welcome back! Glad you’re healthy. Now go vote and pass the  House’s #FamiliesFirst bill that expands #coronavirus testing beyond just senators. https://t.co/ZMk5h4lwtF,3/17/2020 3:21,Twitter for iPhone,1759,10257,corona; 
We need physical distancing NOT democratic distancing. Governor show agility: Allow people to vote in waves over a longer period of time in smaller groups. Use it as a stimulus opportunity to hire poll workers who’ve lost jobs/hours to #coronavirus. And extend absentee voting. https://t.co/m3eRNPcykH,3/17/2020 3:01,Twitter for iPhone,2262,6923,corona; 
This Thursday March 19th I'll be joined by two renowned Bay Area public health experts for a live telephone town hall on #coronavirus. Head to my website or official Facebook for more details.  I hope you'll join us. https://t.co/OZOiQ7sasp,3/16/2020 20:23,Twitter Web App,127,407,corona;

We will get through this together. https://t.co/wkZahYZrrw,3/16/2020 13:47,Twitter for iPad,279,817,corona; 
I reject “social distancing.” As @brianstelter said on @CNN let’s instead practice “physical distancing” to beat #coronavirus. In meantime let’s keep our humanity and fire up FaceTime call friends &amp; maybe just maybe re-download @WordsWFriends. Challenge me at RepSwalwell.,3/15/2020 19:04,Twitter for iPhone,1136,7412,corona; 
If you worked at a supermarket or a pharmacy today thank you. A million. We need each other. #coronavirus,3/15/2020 3:17,Twitter for iPhone,13077,102700,corona; 
Do you think maybe you and the Senate should be in Washington voting on the @HouseDemocrats passed/@realDonaldTrump-supported #coronavirus stimulus? Enjoy your beer. https://t.co/Dab6AxWs3T,3/14/2020 21:34,Twitter for iPhone,9348,43215,corona; 
Millions of college students will be affected by #coronavirus leaving many homeless without food and farther in debt without credits to show for it.

When lawmakers refer to #COVIDー19 as a “Chinese” virus they are not only misleading the public about a disease with confirmed cases in over 100 countries they are stoking racism &amp; xenophobia in our communities. Diseases don’t have an ethnicity. Period. https://t.co/aytY5Jr76c,3/13/2020 17:56,Twitter Web App,1453,5610,covid; 
Every second @GOPLeader @senatemajldr &amp; @realDonaldTrump screw around with #coronavirus #FamiliesFirst funding more people will get sick some will die and the economy will sink further. Time to lead.,3/13/2020 14:59,Twitter for iPhone,2109,8475,corona; 
Every day @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP &amp; @SenateGOP delay a #coronavirus stimulus package people will get sicker and our economy weaker. Enough is enough. It’s time for free testing for all and sick leave for families affected. RT if you agree. #FamiliesFirst,3/13/2020 1:45,Twitter for iPhone,6043,10951,corona; 
The best way to protect yourself against #COVIDー19 is to stay informed. Check out my video below for the simple steps we can all take to help slow the spread of the virus. https://t.co/UTGrs64BaK,3/12/2020 22:36,Twitter Media Studio,592,2152,covid; 
My Securing Energy Critical Elements &amp; American Jobs Act just passed out of subcommittee on @HouseScience!   China’s rare earth exports have fallen by 17% due to coronavirus lowering our domestic supply of #energycriticalelements &amp; further underscoring the need for this bill. https://t.co/imxF9pdNCu,3/12/2020 15:40,Twitter Web App,59,210,corona; 
The President is making a major health care crisis worse. He must be sidelined and refrain from saying anything further about #coronavirus and allow @VP and Congress to work together to take action. Every word Trump unintelligently speaks puts more lives at risk.,3/6/2020 23:56,Twitter for iPhone,9613,41019,corona; 
No one should be turned away from coronavirus testing because of costs. I’m thrilled to see CA’s leadership &amp; dedication to protecting all residents regardless of income.  Remember: anyone showing signs of respiratory illness including fever should report these symptoms ASAP. https://t.co/0JvVwXDG2U,3/6/2020 17:28,Twitter Web App,1464,5666,corona; 
There are several confirmed cases of coronavirus in the Bay Area &amp; the lack of test kits available is shameful. While I am pleased that the House is working to pass an $8.3 billion emergency supplemental package we need swift action &amp; strong leadership from the White House now. https://t.co/jjx2NFMtt2,3/4/2020 20:01,Twitter Web App,721,2570,corona;
