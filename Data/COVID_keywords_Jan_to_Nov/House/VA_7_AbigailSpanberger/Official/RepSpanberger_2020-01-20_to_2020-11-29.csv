As our neighbors communities and small businesses struggle in need of an additional relief bill the Senate held an all-night session.   Not to debate COVID-19 relief not to create a deal but instead to rush through a Supreme Court nominee. (2/4),2020-10-27 00:39:03,Twitter Web App,2,10,covid;

Negotiations between House and Senate leadership on a new COVID-19 relief package have stalled. This is unacceptable. The CARES Act in March proved that we can work quickly with bipartisan &amp; bicameral support to address a crisis and we need that same urgency now.

Negotiations on a new COVID-19 package have stalled. House &amp; Senate leadership must realize that the livelihoods of REAL FAMILIES in #VA07 and across the country are on the line.

In #VA07 we’ve seen firsthand how telemedicine is critical to keeping seniors families and veterans safe during COVID-19. Without this lifeline thousands of Central Virginians could be cut off from their routine appointments and lifesaving care.  https://t.co/PGxqn2eo9y,2020-07-31 01:23:28,Twitter Web App,9,38,covid; 
Both bills passed with bipartisan support —  Child Care is Essential Act: awards grants to childcare providers to help cover increased costs due to COVID-19.

Telehealth has clearly demonstrated its importance and its popularity during the pandemic.  The COVID-19 Telehealth Program Extension Act recognizes the role this technology should continue to play especially as we see a resurgence of the virus in communities across the country.,2020-07-23 21:07:52,Twitter for iPhone,4,12,covid; 
During COVID-19 telemedicine has been a vital lifeline for thousands in #VA07.   Unfortunately the @FCC’s COVID-19 Telehealth Program ran out of funding this month.

Free &amp; low-cost clinics are vital to thousands of uninsured families in Virginia. As COVID-19 persists we cannot forget the ongoing needs of Americans at EVERY income level.

3. Equitable Data Collection and Disclosure on COVID-19 Act.
