Joe Biden would have been a disaster if he were at the helm of USA’s response to #coronavirus!  @realDonaldTrump’s leadership saved lives.   No one can lead America’s comeback like he will. #MAGA2020Landslide https://t.co/05TOYOIdTT,2020-05-04 00:38:52,Twitter for iPhone,6,13,corona; 
Can you imagine if Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders were running the country’s response to Coronavirus?! The American people WOULD NOT have same confidence that they have in @realDonaldTrump to bring leadership needed in such a challenging time. Thankful that @POTUS is at the helm!!,2020-03-04 00:51:23,Twitter for iPhone,4,24,corona;
