The #CARESAct was meant to be a lifeline to Americans while we controlled #COVID19 but the #TrumpAdmin didn't take the virus seriously. We need the #HeroesAct to give more relief to those most in need. Not doing enough now will cause long-term economic damage.,2020-08-05 18:41:14,Twitter Web App,4,19,covid; 
Good news for renters: @WAStateCommerce is distributing $100M in federal #CARESAct funding that can pay up to 3 months in rent and avoid evictions.

#COVID19 has shown just how helpful telemedicine is to caring for people especially in rural areas or where we have provider deserts. We should learn from this moment to make telehealth an important tool going forward. https://t.co/X5dukwiMFq,2020-08-04 19:49:40,Twitter Web App,2,9,covid; 
The lack of a coordinated national response to #COVID19 is having a devastating impact on our ability to curb the spread of this virus and safely reopen our economy. The #TrumpAdmin needs to step up before more people suffer from this outbreak. https://t.co/cfVYXL3Zr6,2020-08-03 22:07:33,Twitter Web App,6,14,covid; 
We need to use every tool available to help stop the spread of #COVID19 but also protect our personal information.

#COVID19 has only exacerbated the existing affordable housing crisis. 1/3 of Americans (mostly renters) said they couldn't pay their full housing cost this month. We need to make affordable housing a priority in pandemic relief.,2020-07-31 16:28:26,Twitter Web App,8,21,covid;
