The President still has not said if he has tested negative yet still wants to invite hundreds of people to the site of a COVID-19 hotspot. This is reckless and DANGEROUS. https://t.co/lMOPNhb3IM,2020-10-10 17:08:38,Twitter Web App,2,5,covid; 
We often think of mental health as an isolated issue but it's not. Stress from COVID-19 racial injustice homelessness election unemployment &amp; more all play a role.

Too many Americans have already lost a job due to COVID-19. We can’t afford to lose any more. That’s why my priority of a jobs protection plan was included in the Heroes relief package. (1/2),2020-05-20 17:48:49,Gain Platform,1,3,covid;
