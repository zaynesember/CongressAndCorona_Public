The surge in COVID clusters we’ve been seeing is incredibly concerning and must be addressed. We made too much progress to go backwards.

I voted against Heroes 2.0 because this bill means both sides have given up on getting a deal on COVID-19 relief—and I will never do that. It's time to put our country first. https://t.co/xxnJJlkR0l,2020-10-02 00:28:30,Twitter Web App,11,35,covid; 
COVID relief was essential but it will have all kinds of tax implications that families &amp; businesses will need to get ahead of. But right now Staten Islanders have no way to get free full service in-person help.  I'm asking @IRSnews to change that. https://t.co/xedP8LZxfs,2020-09-24 20:19:11,Twitter Web App,2,5,covid; 
From building hospitals to distributing tests our National Guard members who deployed to help with COVID saw what needed to be done and they did it even if wasn't what they were used to.

Proud to stand with my colleagues @ProbSolveCaucus to unveil our framework to break the partisan gridlock &amp; bring Congress back to the table on a COVID-19 relief bill.

We've got just a few weeks until the cash runs dry for the federal government but for too many families &amp; businesses it already has.

From limited access to healthcare to crowded living conditions–public housing presents some of the top COVID risk factors.

The medical exams our veterans need for their benefit claims are pretty routine so there's no reason they can't be done via telehealth.

FEMA is right 50m total COVID tests is great but it's not nearly enough. Until there's a vaccine we need to be doing millions of tests every day.  Yet when we ask for a strategy to get there this Administration puts its head in the sand. https://t.co/UlglR62M3G,2020-07-22 18:29:32,Twitter Web App,17,49,covid; 
We’ve come a long way in New York to bring down our coronavirus numbers but until a vaccine is widely available we need continual and aggressive testing programs—and pooled testing is the most effective way to do that. https://t.co/wOJ5N8rHsO,2020-07-20 15:39:29,Twitter Web App,2,4,corona; 
REMINDER: Today is the new Tax Day after it was extended from April 15th but the challenges taxpayers are facing from #COVID19 haven't gone away.

The VA is committed to innovative ways to ramp up #COVID testing but right now they're struggling to operate at more than about 50% testing capacity because they don't have enough swabs.

Our Public Safety Officer Pandemic Response Act of 2020 will ensure that a COVID-19 diagnosis will be presumed to constitute a personal injury in the line of duty so that no police officer or their family has to fight with the government about whether they got sick on the job.,2020-04-21 19:18:49,Twitter for iPhone,1,5,covid;
