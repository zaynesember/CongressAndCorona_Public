The new SSG Michael Ollis Ferry has already been delayed long enough. So when COVID pushed it even further @HeyNowJO and I got to work.

NEW AD: When the pandemic hit we stood up a COVID-only hospital in just 6 days and got the first drive-thru testing site in the whole city right here in #NY11.

This is everything we hate about politics. If it wasn’t clear before it is now: the only person standing in the way of COVID relief is Mitch McConnell. https://t.co/9C92hHvJLR,2020-10-20 21:20:16,Twitter for iPhone,84,327,covid; 
Let’s be clear: politics and elections cannot and must not be a factor in COVID relief negotiations. People are hurting and the last thing they care about is who in Washington gets credit for doing our jobs. Leaders in both parties need to stop the posturing and get a deal done. https://t.co/V5rB5kM2rf,2020-10-19 15:21:07,Twitter Media Studio,24,82,covid; 
I have consistently stood up to leadership in both parties and fought for bipartisan bold COVID relief. The consequences of not doing so would be catastrophic for first responders public servants and all the people of #NY11. #NY11debate https://t.co/WN5zVTvWjn,2020-10-14 23:14:53,Twitter Web App,12,38,covid; 
At the height of the COVID pandemic @NMalliotakis shared a photoshopped picture of herself on the frontlines cut $400 million from our hospitals and protected shady nursing homes from being held accountable. #NY11debate https://t.co/sI1BVQUWjy,2020-10-14 23:11:19,Twitter Web App,10,35,covid; 
I am honored to have @NYNurses’ support. When COVID hit nurses risked everything to save lives. They are the definition of heroes. But @NMalliotakis shared photoshopped pictures of herself on the frontlines and cut $400 million from our hospitals and the nurses who work there. https://t.co/0Gc9YSV0Hy,2020-10-11 21:08:24,Twitter Web App,34,175,covid; 
Failing to provide federal COVID relief will have very real devastating consequences for Staten Islanders and South Brooklynites. Our neighbors are already struggling to make ends meet and our small businesses will only continue closing.,2020-10-10 16:58:07,Twitter Web App,5,12,covid; 
We’re on the verge of economic collapse in NYC unless we get a substantive COVID relief bill passed.

Even though leaders in Washington have given up -- I haven’t and I won’t. We can and must pass bold bipartisan COVID relief that extends unemployment supports our small businesses and yes provides aid for our state and local governments. https://t.co/XHe9ukyFQ9,2020-10-07 22:21:22,Twitter Web App,14,59,covid;

COVID relief is critical--and possible. When lives and economies are on the line we can’t shrink from our responsibility. We’re Americans first not Democrats or Republicans.

When the city shut down our union brothers and sisters kept going. It is up to us to have their backs like they had ours both here at home and in Washington.
