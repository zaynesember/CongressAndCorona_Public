Latinos are disproportionately impacted by COVID-19 – both by the virus itself and its economic consequences. This Hispanic Heritage Month we can’t hide from that reality. It’s not enough to celebrate Latino culture if we are not working to protect Latino lives. #HHM,2020-09-24 23:08:43,Twitter Web App,7,14,covid;

Women make up 52% of essential workers during the #COVID19 pandemic.

Rent is due &amp; many families don't know how they're going to make payments amid #COVID19. The Republican Senate's failure to act means that millions could soon lose the roofs over their heads.
