Responsible action on #COVID19 has been delayed for months while @SpeakerPelosi plays politics and obstructs Paycheck Protection Program legislation. Congress needs to get back to work and leave political agendas at home. My latest opinion in @knoxnews ⬇️ https://t.co/dyIphB5R2m,2020-11-02 17:51:19,Twitter Web App,52,173,covid; 
I joined @6News to react to President Trump testing positive for COVID-19.  I'm praying for President Trump and the First Lady and wish them both a speedy recovery.

"We can’t go home" without a coronavirus relief deal – Speaker Pelosi on July 26.  Then she recessed the House when negotiations didn’t go her way.   She was right the first time. Congress needs to stay in town after Saturday’s messaging vote to work on a sensible relief bill.,2020-08-19 17:49:07,Twitter Web App,6,62,corona; 
At the same time its a shame @SpeakerPelosi is prioritizing messaging bills over a bipartisan Coronavirus relief bill. Congress needs to be in Washington working through the committee process ensuring all Americans' voices are heard to deliver an effective federal response.,2020-08-17 19:47:49,Twitter Web App,40,141,corona; 
Negotiations over the next #COVID19 relief package were a disaster and show Congress’ dysfunction. This is what happens if major decisions are left up to a few party leaders. Americans lose when Congress skips the committee process or refuses to work with the President.,2020-08-12 14:21:15,Twitter Web App,5,87,covid; 
If businesses are protecting their customers employees and public health they deserve to be shielded from frivolous COVID-19 lawsuits.
