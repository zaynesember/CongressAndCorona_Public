For months experts have agreed we need to test millions/day.   Sunday the Trump 'testing plan' said 300000/day is enough.   I trust the experts.

Former FDA head @ScottGottliebMD says we can only process 16000 tests/day in labs right now.  @SteveFDA if that's true it'll take 60 days to process kits we currently have.  Huge problem. https://t.co/eWs2A1ojVg,2020-03-11 16:51:28,Twitter Media Studio,39,65,corona; 
The American people are worried about missing paychecks affording coronavirus tests &amp; being able to afford healthcare period.  But @realDonaldTrump wants to bail out the oil industry?  Leave it to Trump to prioritize his friends over the American people. https://t.co/3TiErMksGG,2020-03-10 21:04:24,Twitter Web App,228,431,corona; 
.@realDonaldTrump &amp; @CDCDirector now both say with more coronavirus tests getting out anyone can get tested.  But what matters is whether we have the capacity to actually process those tests.   If we can only process 16000 total patients/day—that's not enough. https://t.co/zFg0bYSpJI,2020-03-10 18:29:13,Twitter Web App,11,36,corona; 
This afternoon at 1:30 PM CT I'm hosting a Facebook Live to give an update on the coronavirus outbreak.  Tune in and ask me your questions! https://t.co/S042hdhKju https://t.co/4ZRHx5DPYx,2020-03-08 14:34:44,Twitter for iPhone,8,13,corona; 
We need transparency.  That's why @RepGallagher and I introduced the Medical Supply Chain Security Act--to ensure we understand how coronavirus abroad threatens the supply of life-saving medical devices in America. https://t.co/SKc4NZWrVG,2020-03-07 18:39:25,Twitter Media Studio,17,57,corona; 
We don't need politicians telling people to go to work if they have coronavirus.  We need doctors guiding our nation with the facts. https://t.co/xmjDFY60qJ,2020-03-06 23:50:29,Twitter Media Studio,33,131,corona; 
This Sunday I'm hosting a Facebook Live to give the people of the 2nd District and update on the coronavirus outbreak.  Tune in on March 8 1:30 PM CT to ask me your questions! https://t.co/0u2T9G1Aj6 https://t.co/wFTB9fF8H1,2020-03-06 18:50:09,Twitter Web App,5,10,corona; 
Now more than ever it's important to know the facts.  See below for some key information from the Wisconsin Department of Health Services on coronavirus in Wisconsin.  If you have any questions please contact the Wisconsin DHS at (608) 266-1865. https://t.co/tsUrJtKG3i,2020-03-06 00:59:09,Twitter Web App,13,21,corona; 
It's time that we begin to proactively test people for coronavirus nationwide.  We can no longer just wait for sick patients to walk into the hospital.  It's time we take action. https://t.co/itakafK1Ub,2020-03-05 18:14:12,Twitter Media Studio,29,93,corona; 
This is a public health crisis.  ‘Corona flu’? Suggesting people with coronavirus go to work? Disputing actual World Health Organization data?  This president is completely unfit to lead this country through this national crisis.  I am deeply concerned. https://t.co/T2ElXZ6lbr,2020-03-05 14:21:09,Twitter for iPhone,218,634,corona; 
The experts agree: we NEED to be proactively testing for coronavirus.  Anything less is a threat to our nation. https://t.co/7qsBxOCf2m,2020-03-04 19:29:45,Twitter Media Studio,32,98,corona; 
Still no information about the number of people tested for coronavirus.  @CDCDirector the American people deserve transparency.  Your silence is deafening. https://t.co/y6uRMHxeqU,2020-03-03 17:33:25,Twitter for Android,67,145,corona; 
Ahead of @realDonaldTrump's press conference on coronavirus I'm urging him to for once in his life to listen to the experts in the room.   The American people cannot afford anymore mixed messages.  Give the mic to a doctor. Please. https://t.co/ejF6t6yz2O,2020-02-29 18:52:24,Twitter Media Studio,23,102,corona; 
A point I also made with @SecAzar in our hearing yesterday.  The FDA has warned of drug shortages from China due to our lack of domestic manufacturing but @SteveFDA isn't a part of the team working on our coronavirus response?  The priorities of this president are baffling. https://t.co/7oCdAzqNyL,2020-02-27 17:56:38,Twitter Web App,11,34,corona; 
The spread of coronavirus makes one of the strongest cases for why we urgently need #MedicareForAll.  If folks can't afford to get tested or treated how do we manage the spread of disease?  A year after it was introduced we need #M4A now more than ever. https://t.co/lIcO7KZ7Ex,2020-02-27 15:44:15,Twitter Web App,288,735,corona; 
While we didn't agree on everything Trump's former FDA commissioner @ScottGottliebMD fought to get generic drugs to market quicker and has been an acute observer of the trends &amp; data around coronavirus.

.@realDonaldTrump has tried to take $3.8 billion in defense funds to build a useless &amp; racist border wall.  If he actually cared about protecting Americans he would use that 'wall' money to fight the coronavirus.  Or at least learn how to spell it. https://t.co/FNC4eGMIjW,2020-02-26 18:26:48,Twitter Media Studio,78,237,corona; 
When a vaccine for #coronavirus becomes available it should be affordable and accessible for all Americans.  That’s why l joined @janschakowsky to call on @realDonaldTrump to ensure fair drug pricing for a COVID-19 vaccine that taxpayers have already invested in. https://t.co/EDuUnTW9Zs,2020-02-21 13:56:41,Twitter for iPhone,11,61,covid; corona;
