I led a letter today with @RepJayapal and other members of the WA delegation urging @fema and @HHSGov to allow #COVID19 test specimens in WA to be sent to our public health labs that have capacity. This would cut the wait time for results from up to 8 days to only 24-48 hours. https://t.co/PdREZBCrgN,2020-03-25 23:45:14,Twitter Web App,77,259,covid; 
As civilian medical facilities around the South Sound have become strained with the #COVID19 crisis I am in contact with Madigan Army Medical Center to find out what they need to keep caring for patients and prepare to assist with capacity for the region as the virus spreads.,2020-03-24 23:53:14,Twitter Web App,3,15,covid; 
As the #COVID19 pandemic continues we’re changing our way of life to slow the spread of the virus at least for the near future. We’re all going to need to adapt and that can be challenging. Servicemembers and their families can be particularly affected.,2020-03-24 23:49:27,Twitter Web App,14,54,covid; 
Thank you to @Up4Growth for endorsing the Emergency Rental Assistance Act of 2020. As you point out our national housing shortage was already straining American families and we need to be innovative and efficient in getting them relief during the #COVID19 crisis. https://t.co/Qc5K9Ajii6,2020-03-24 20:04:17,Twitter Web App,4,18,covid;

Due to the #COVID19 crisis many American families won't be able to afford April rent next week. Today I introduced emergency legislation to put $100 billion into rental assistance and expand the number of people who will get help. https://t.co/9IonOWYXOu,2020-03-23 19:55:27,Twitter Web App,30,111,covid; 
#COVID19 doesn't recognize race ethnicity or nationality.  We will only keep our community healthy if we all choose to take preventative steps to stop the spread of the virus and recognize that we are all in this shared fight together. https://t.co/x0uaDinOFk,2020-03-23 15:48:43,Twitter Web App,15,48,covid; 
Social distancing is necessary to slow the spread of COVID-19 and protect our families and neighbors. But there are challenges that come with it. @WADeptHealth is sharing some ways to cope with the stress.

Our economic response to #COVID19 must match the speed and size of the crisis. This week I wrote to Speaker Pelosi outlining policies that can serve as the basis for an effective stimulus package that provides immediate relief to American families. https://t.co/2b5WskGTVX,2020-03-21 15:52:26,Twitter Web App,14,68,covid; 
As @Chris_ArnoldNPR writes we can’t leave renters out of the equation. In addition to mortgage forbearance I called on Speaker Pelosi and the House to include immediate and increased rental assistance in the next #COVID19 stimulus package. https://t.co/D1n0ztgyxU,2020-03-20 17:48:04,Twitter Web App,0,13,covid;

Two weeks ago Secretary Azar proposed using the Defense Production Act to boost the manufacture of critical medical supplies.
