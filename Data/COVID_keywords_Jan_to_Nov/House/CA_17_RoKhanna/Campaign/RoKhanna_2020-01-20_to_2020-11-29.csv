It’s unconscionable for Republicans to continue cutting SNAP at a time when working class Americans could lose wages or wind up with medical debt due to COVID-19.   Instead of cuts we need to make sure that SNAP is available for all those who need it. https://t.co/Fm2DL0X9P4,2020-03-14 18:34:00,TweetDeck,188,588,covid; 
When we think of people missing work due to COVID-19 we have to consider the 48 million Americans with student debt.   All those who have to miss work should have their student loan payments temporarily suspended.,2020-03-14 02:17:00,TweetDeck,196,966,covid; 
There’s a public health crisis &amp; instead of focusing on testing people for COVID-19 and supporting workers who could lose wages or even their jobs Trump is trying to start a war with Iran.

Congress must take immediate action to stop the spread of COVID-19. https://t.co/RfVV77k6EW,2020-03-13 18:03:00,TweetDeck,54,175,covid; 
When many federal employees had to find temporary jobs during last year’s government shutdown it showed the reality of living paycheck-to-paycheck in America.   The spread of COVID-19 will have an even greater impact.  We need to guarantee paid sick leave immediately.,2020-03-13 16:03:00,TweetDeck,112,411,covid; 
A payroll tax cut won’t be enough to help those who have to stay home because they are sick.  It won’t help those who could see their hours cut or even lose their jobs due to the economic impact of COVID-19.  Congress must expand Medicare and guarantee paid sick leave to all.,2020-03-13 14:02:00,TweetDeck,206,724,covid; 
Researchers in Texas developed a coronavirus vaccine in 2016 that could be adapted but didn’t have NIH funding to develop it.  Meanwhile the CDC budget is only 1.5% of our defense budget as we lag behind on testing.  This raises serious questions about public health funding. https://t.co/aapHKxCuaC,2020-03-13 01:43:18,TweetDeck,863,2241,corona; 
I want to clarify that it was a coronavirus vaccine as I said on MSNBC and not specific to Covid 19. It still would have been extraordinary helpful and made tweaking it easier.,2020-03-13 00:29:44,Twitter for iPhone,34,278,covid; corona; 
@OmanReagan @but_rly_tho @briebriejoy I had said coronavirus on MSNBC based on the NBC report. Your correction is a fair point for precision. Thanks.,2020-03-13 00:25:40,Twitter for iPhone,0,13,corona; 
The United States is one of the few countries that doesn’t provide paid sick leave to our people. To make sure that people stay home when they are sick and aren’t forced to miss a paycheck due to COVID-19 we must guarantee paid sick leave to every worker ASAP. https://t.co/VXJIFqmun2,2020-03-11 18:13:00,TweetDeck,126,350,covid; 
Many working class Americans work in jobs where they can’t work remotely have no paid sick leave and live paycheck-to-paycheck.   The loss of business due to the coronavirus will disproportionately affect them whether they get the virus or not. https://t.co/9iJVFC55FG,2020-03-11 16:11:00,TweetDeck,79,242,corona; 
Bailing out the oil industry won’t help the workers who have to choose between their health and their paychecks.  It won’t help the people who could go into medical debt from COVID-19.   We need paid family leave and Medicare expanded to every American. https://t.co/EUKwuEnAnh,2020-03-11 14:23:00,TweetDeck,99,336,covid; 
Here’s what Congress must do to stop the spread of the coronavirus:  ✅ $15 billion in emergency funding to help get tests out as quickly as possible  ✅ Extending Medicare coverage to all for primary care and emergency visits  ✅ Guarantee paid sick leave for workers,2020-03-10 23:59:00,TweetDeck,344,938,corona;

There are 7 million food service workers in the United States who are forced to go without pay if they are too sick to work.  The threat of the coronavirus stresses why it's so important to guarantee paid sick leave to every American. https://t.co/8d9YQJAYu1,2020-03-09 16:49:00,TweetDeck,111,298,corona; 
To tackle coronavirus Congress should extend Medicare coverage without copays or deductibles to all Americans for primary care visits &amp; emergency care especially for people over 50 with chronic health issues. We can do so even on a temporary basis. @BernieSanders @howserob,2020-03-07 16:39:54,Twitter for iPhone,390,1188,corona; 
Harry Truman Dr. King and Barack Obama have all been falsely branded as socialists in the past.  @BernieSanders is talking about common sense and he’s our best choice to lead whether it’s in defeating Donald Trump or stopping the coronavirus. https://t.co/8wNZmHl2TI,2020-03-02 15:11:00,TweetDeck,921,3416,corona; 
Coronavirus shows the importance of @BernieSanders' Medicare for All.  In a pandemic you don't want people avoiding getting tested or treated because they can't afford a $3000 medical bill.  We're only as safe as the least insured person among us. Everyone has to be covered. https://t.co/CrHQnlvf4U,2020-02-29 21:17:41,Twitter Media Studio,5798,21218,corona; 
Trump’s budget is making cuts to the National Institutes of Health and Center for Disease Control at a time when we have the Coronavirus. To me that is just mind boggling. https://t.co/h5NJ30sMoi,2020-02-26 21:31:00,TweetDeck,130,363,corona; 
.@RonaldKlain is absolutely right to sound the alarm on what we are doing to prepare for the coronavirus. He brought extraordinary competence to government. Excellence at the job is one of the most under appreciated virtues in public service. It is devoid in this administration. https://t.co/BlstdlzMRX,2020-02-25 02:18:10,Twitter for iPhone,60,158,corona;
