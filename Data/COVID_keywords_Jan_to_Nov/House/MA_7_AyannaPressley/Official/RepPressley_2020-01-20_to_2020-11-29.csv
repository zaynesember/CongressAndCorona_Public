Last week @RepAOC @NydiaVelazquez  &amp; @RepRashida and I sent a letter to the Director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons demanding information on what steps the BOP is taking to prepare for and prevent the spread of the COVID-19 within federal prisons. #StopCOVID19inJails https://t.co/k2xhQ2IDOy,2020-03-14 22:27:10,Twitter Web App,121,395,covid; 
One vulnerable population that has been ignored during #COVID19 response are the 2.3 million people in prison who are at high risk for virus spreading. Prisons can be incubators for infectious disease.  I'll be discussing this &amp; more w/ @TheRevAl shortly on @MSNBC #TuneIn,2020-03-14 21:04:39,TweetDeck,398,1840,covid; 
#Covid_19 is a #PublicHealth crisis and the federal gov't must confront it with every tool at our disposal to protect the most vulnerable among us including our nation's incarcerated men and women. #JusticeGuarantee #StopCovid19inJails https://t.co/DchB4Mds3E,2020-03-13 20:14:14,Twitter Web App,31,128,covid; 
Housing is a fundamental human right and the displacement of families will only exacerbate the #CoronavirusPandemic. TY for your leadership @LydiaMEdwards! https://t.co/u5N4hQfeD8,2020-03-12 20:48:05,Twitter for iPhone,124,540,corona;

#Coronavirus testing must be made free to the public if we are going to understand the scope of this crisis.   Anything less will undermine America’s effort to protect our communities and save lives.   RT if you agree #FamiliesFirst,2020-03-12 12:15:33,Twitter for iPhone,12193,26686,corona; 
At today's @FSCDems hearing w/ #WellsFargo CEO Charles Scharf I asked him whether or not he would provide ALL Wells Fargo employees - including custodial call center &amp; third-party workers- w/ paid leave sick days &amp; remote options while we combat #coronavirus #COVID19 https://t.co/fvw9Gxbl7Q,2020-03-10 20:34:01,Twitter Media Studio,88,409,covid; corona; 
The risk of catching the #coronavirus for my friends &amp; neighbors in #MA7 remains low. @HealthyBoston &amp; @BOSTON_EMS have taken extensive steps to prepare for a potential outbreak. As the @CDCgov works to develop a vaccine there are steps you can take: https://t.co/ss5rumDJF1,2020-03-04 17:49:04,Twitter Web App,11,66,corona; 
Americans have already invested almost $700 MILLION into #coronavirus research. That’s why I joined my sister in service @janschakowsky &amp; 40+ of my colleagues to demand that the White House ensures that the COVID-19 vaccine is affordable &amp; accessible. https://t.co/VlrgXHyzdY,2020-02-20 19:46:18,Twitter Web App,14,65,covid; corona;
