It's the first Thanksgiving in my life I don’t want to spend with my parents because the risk is too great—but I’m thankful they are alive &amp; well. For more than 250000 American families the empty spots at the table this year are a grim reminder of the devastating toll of COVID19,2020-11-26 16:39:24,Twitter Web App,92,795,covid; 
The United States just set a record for new coronavirus cases in one day: 77640. And President Trump still doesn't have a plan. https://t.co/PSTpzSVtNs,2020-10-23 17:03:29,Twitter Web App,51,171,corona; 
Whether it’s coronavirus or forest fires the president’s message is “you’re on your own"—the antithesis of our nation's motto: "Out of many one."   It’s time for a leader who will prevent crises rather than politicize them. Joe Biden will restore empathy to the White House. https://t.co/30LoVUEipg,2020-10-16 20:26:51,Twitter Web App,18,108,corona; 
Gold Star families have already suffered unspeakable tragedy. For the President to suggest it's their fault he contracted Coronavirus when he has been flouting medical advice since day one of the pandemic would be laughable if it weren't so reprehensible. https://t.co/F7yR9adCBH,2020-10-08 17:11:30,Twitter Web App,234,881,corona; 
"Because of Covid-19 Trump called himself a wartime president but he didn’t heed his generals and never ordered ammunition." https://t.co/YyDloW47Sx,2020-09-14 20:36:24,Twitter for iPhone,21,93,covid; 
On Jan. 28 Trump was told coronavirus would be "the biggest national security threat" of his presidency. Just days before he said "We have it under control. It's going to be just fine." https://t.co/sHiJ4rPcgq,2020-09-09 19:51:28,Twitter Web App,21,65,corona; 
The coronavirus and the president’s trade war are a one-two punch against our fishermen. I’m going to keep fighting back with them. https://t.co/NleU9oKqC1,2020-08-29 14:00:17,Buffer,13,49,corona; 
When I heard about the first death of a grocery store worker from Coronavirus I got on the phone with the governor and asked that they be classified essential in order to get priority testing. It was done the next day. https://t.co/qGi2DxHxxe,2020-08-28 12:06:05,Buffer,15,137,corona;

Why is the MLB taking Coronavirus more seriously than Republicans in Congress? https://t.co/AidlydlRTY,2020-07-30 12:02:00,Buffer,18,80,corona; 
Coronavirus has disrupted our lives in ways we never could have predicted. This is an opportunity to think big transform our country and come out stronger on the other side. https://t.co/uq6VL6aL10,2020-05-19 20:59:31,Twitter Web App,19,135,corona; 
I'm glad that we could help @NortheastArc locate this shipment. Nonprofits and states in the richest country on Earth should be focused on the response to coronavirus not competing against each other for protective equipment. https://t.co/IIiMC3rQyR,2020-05-06 19:38:36,Twitter Web App,7,11,corona; 
I'm hosting a virtual conversation today at 5 pm in partnership with Samaritans of Boston to discuss access to mental health resources during coronavirus. Join us at https://t.co/pwkF1svR5v,2020-05-06 13:53:22,Twitter Web App,2,4,corona;

We know about the public health consequences of COVID-19 but the pandemic leaves us vulnerable in other ways too. I’m looking forward to joining @Maura_Healey for a conversation on how to protect yourself from online threats in the age of coronavirus. https://t.co/U97zvylLsJ,2020-04-27 17:11:02,Twitter Web App,3,11,covid; corona;

I sent a letter to the Trump administration more than a month ago asking what the @DeptofDefense is doing to protect our armed forces from COVID-19. I still haven't heard back from them but it looks like the answer is clearly not enough. https://t.co/Z6LvJ43cqq,2020-04-15 18:10:18,Twitter Web App,17,65,covid; 
History will remember that President Trump chose to ignore the threat of the coronavirus. We need to make sure Americans remember that decision when they make theirs at the polls this November. https://t.co/4ddksyrv2C,2020-04-08 18:51:45,Twitter Web App,32,120,corona; 
No one should die of COVID-19 because they are in jail. We must ensure people in the criminal justice system aren't being overlooked in this crisis. https://t.co/MFx5xLCAcB,2020-04-06 13:38:03,Twitter for iPhone,5,35,covid; 
I strongly support the @PIH contact tracing efforts announced by @MassGovernor today. I’m lucky to count Dr. Paul Farmer as a member of my Coronavirus Advisory Team. PIH’s efforts led by some of the most experienced people in the world will save lives. https://t.co/blBAiAUidz,2020-04-03 21:32:02,Twitter for iPhone,17,76,corona; 
Coronavirus testing and treatment should be free. https://t.co/t8vJ500Dzx,2020-03-31 13:08:29,Twitter Web App,45,201,corona; 
We all have a part to play in fighting #coronavirus. Congress is acting today to help hospitals &amp; health care workers. MA-businesses are stepping up where they can. I’m proud of the work of @ColinAngle and @iRobot who donated some surgical masks locally.,2020-03-27 16:05:25,Twitter Web App,4,45,corona;

This is the right call @MassGovernor. We all must do our part to stop the spread of COVID-19. Stay home. https://t.co/5UntvFYyup,2020-03-23 14:52:06,Twitter Web App,6,48,covid; 
We know the best way to stop #coronavirus is to stay home. A statewide shelter in place is the right thing to do. If Governor Baker ordered this I would strongly support it and I know several North Shore mayors would too.,2020-03-23 13:57:04,Twitter Web App,31,208,corona; 
.@DeptVetAffairs responsible for more than 9 million patients has administered 322 coronavirus tests. Our veterans deserve better than this. We need to increase testing everywhere especially within the VA. https://t.co/tMVSlFqm8C,2020-03-18 20:23:01,Twitter for iPhone,72,154,corona;

We are currently operating at Level 2 but are vigilantly monitoring the situation and prepared to shift if necessary. I’m confident that implementing guidelines such as these will significantly slow the spread of COVID-19.,2020-03-12 16:29:48,Twitter for iPhone,4,25,covid; 
It’s important we react to COVID-19 in a measured but decisive manner. That’s why I’ve developed and implemented a comprehensive plan for my team that I hope can serve as an example for others. Our response operates on three levels:,2020-03-12 16:27:27,Twitter for iPhone,14,79,covid; 
I'm thankful the Vice President is listening to the experts taking the threat of Coronavirus seriously and acting accordingly.  This is how a leader responds in a crisis. https://t.co/LSMe5G10X3,2020-03-11 22:25:45,Twitter Web App,25,157,corona;

Good news: Mike Pence who doesn't believe in evolution or climate change (science!) is in charge of managing Coronavirus. Problem solved! https://t.co/pVVQs36UqU,2020-02-27 00:33:29,Twitter for iPhone,99,484,corona;
