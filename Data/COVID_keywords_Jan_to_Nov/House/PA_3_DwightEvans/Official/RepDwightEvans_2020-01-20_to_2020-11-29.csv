.@HouseDemocrats have passed major #Covid_19 relief twice now! (May 15 Oct. 1) Trump keeps negotiating with himself on Twitter but the even bigger roadblock may be McConnell and the Republican Senate: https://t.co/CHKPTZAkC4,2020-10-16 16:48:16,Twitter for iPhone,5,6,covid; 
.@HouseDemocrats saw this coming – so we passed the #HeroesAct in May &amp; an updated version Oct. 1. Meanwhile Trump has been negotiating with himself on Twitter &amp; McConnell has a “skinny” #Covid_19 bill that’s less than 1/3 the size of Trump’s inadequate plan. https://t.co/QQIcMnUoE6,2020-10-16 14:37:35,Twitter for iPhone,9,14,covid;

@215Juni The House has passed it twice in the Heroes Act first in May &amp; then an updated version on Oct. 1. The GOP Senate hasn't passed it or a major Covid relief since the Cares Act in March. https://t.co/pMoScvPpSX,2020-10-12 21:53:34,Twitter Web App,0,0,covid; 
4/ The coronavirus crisis has exacerbated the housing crisis.   That’s why I support the updated #HeroesAct @HouseDemocrats passed – it would help struggling families afford a safe place to live with tens of billions in new supports to assist renters and homeowners. https://t.co/fKIwETQyfT,2020-10-08 20:21:38,Twitter for iPhone,2,2,corona;

McConnell says he’s “full steam ahead” on rushing through Trump’s Supreme Court nominee despite Trump &amp; a GOP senator testing positive for Covid.

4/ Rather than implement a national testing strategy the WH believed “an effective political strategy” would be blaming Democratic governors for #COVID19.   Now more than 7M Americans have been infected – including Trump!   We need #UniversalTesting. https://t.co/D1vmHYXkdT https://t.co/8gR6jLYL6P,2020-10-02 20:34:42,Twitter for iPhone,2,5,covid;

1/ I wish for a speedy recovery not only for the president and first lady but for all the 6800000 surviving Americans who have tested positive for Covid.   I hope this news convinces all Americans to take this virus seriously.,2020-10-02 14:00:46,Twitter for iPhone,10,25,covid;

3/ What would it take for Republicans in DC &amp; Harrisburg to focus on the country’s biggest problem – the #Covid_19 pandemic – and work with Democrats to get the virus under control?   Over 200000 Americans have died &amp; millions of Americans are out of work.   #CovidReliefNOW,2020-09-30 21:57:56,Twitter for iPhone,8,21,covid;

1/ In DC GOP Senate wants to rush through Trump’s Supreme Court nominee to strike down the Affordable Care Act.   But no vote on the #HeroesAct major Covid relief the House passed 138 days ago!   @HouseDemocrats are meeting GOP halfway by passing an updated Heroes Act today.,2020-09-30 21:57:21,Twitter for iPhone,33,45,covid;

1/ CDC eviction moratorium just “kicked the can down the road.”   This is why the @HouseDemocrats’ compromise #HeroesAct announced last night includes $50 billion in rental assistance.   Will GOP Senate finally compromise &amp; help us deliver more #Covid_19 relief? https://t.co/rWJFBpyGav,2020-09-29 15:12:43,Twitter for iPhone,37,61,covid;

Justice Ginsburg was crucial on health care.   The Affordable Care Act was only saved by one vote on the Supreme Court.   The American people deserve the chance to weigh in on this vacancy especially during the Covid pandemic! https://t.co/hvXy2wSaUF,2020-09-21 20:05:18,Twitter for iPhone,2,9,covid; 
If Trump forces a #Covid_19 vaccine out before independent scientists say it’s safe &amp; reliable he should volunteer to be FIRST to receive it.

The #COVID_19 pandemic has created unforeseen challenges for us all – leaving many us of mentally drained. Thankfully in PA @GovernorTomWolf has launched a mental health resources page.   You can find help here: https://t.co/yOTnT2z6vM,2020-08-19 21:02:22,Twitter for iPhone,3,6,covid; 
1/ Both landlords and tenants have experienced economic hardship due to #COVID_19. @HUDgov has provided resources for both tenants &amp; landlords dealing with missed or delayed payments due to the pandemic.   ➡️Renters: https://t.co/TKfM1iTyAw ➡️ Landlords: https://t.co/18Ha2xWVTJ,2020-08-17 22:17:19,Twitter for iPhone,1,3,covid; 
More than 20 million Americans will face eviction in the coming weeks.  Trump’s executive orders do nothing to quell this problem!  @HouseDemocrats on the other hand passed the #HeroesAct back in May to help our most vulnerable families during #COVID_19. https://t.co/PGUcFyNXCh,2020-08-13 18:59:37,Twitter for iPhone,2,2,covid; 
You can’t fight #COVID19 without testing and contact tracing. Trump has refused to develop and implement a national strategy and this #FailuretoLead is costing lives. This is a national crisis that requires a national strategy. https://t.co/OY7cCQhIDy,2020-08-12 20:42:05,Twitter for iPhone,2,3,covid; 
Today at 1:30 PM I’ll be doing a live interview with @StacyBrownMedia of @BlackPressUSA.   We’ll be talking about #Covid19 relief problems with the Postal Service the Census and more!

2/ #COVID19 has closed hundreds of the #Philly area’s small businesses – and it could get worse without the lifelines for people &amp; small businesses in the #HeroesAct.   @HouseDemocrats passed it 12 weeks ago &amp; the GOP Senate should vote on it!   https://t.co/XSbuXtsllA,2020-08-11 00:14:24,Twitter for iPhone,2,6,covid; 
Nearly 5000 PA small businesses have received #COVID19 financial relief through the state.   Like in other states across the country PA #smallbiz need additional federal aid to get the economy back on track!   https://t.co/lfg15ZLDUI,2020-08-11 00:14:15,Twitter for iPhone,6,9,covid; 
1/ American families need federal funding to fight this pandemic.  In #Philly @PhilaHsgAuthPHA will use $4.5 million of #CARESAct funding to help low income families respond to #COVID19. https://t.co/0hwqYM1UVD,2020-08-10 22:07:18,Twitter for iPhone,2,5,covid; 
2/ @WhipClyburn has outlined 3 steps to stop #COVID19 deaths in nursing homes accounting for 40% of overall toll:  ☑️Coordinated testing/ PPE ☑️Rigorous oversight of nursing homes ☑️#FairPay/ #PaidLeave for staff  The Admin still has yet to implement any of these #FailuretoLead,2020-08-07 21:40:01,Twitter for iPhone,10,13,covid; 
➡️4.9 million cases. ➡️160000 dead. ➡️55 million first-time unemployment claims.   President Trump’s #FailuretoLead left millions infected thousands dead &amp; the worst economic disaster since the Great Depression. #COVID19,2020-08-07 21:39:43,Twitter for iPhone,8,17,covid; 
#COVID19 relief and protections are running out:   •unemployment benefits-❌EXPIRED • federal moratorium-❌EXPIRED   Millions of America’s renters could soon be pushed to the brink. All b/c Senate Republicans have failed to act &amp; provide relief to families during this pandemic. https://t.co/EU5pGE8S2M,2020-08-06 20:16:44,Twitter for iPhone,2,0,covid; 
I was proud to stand with postal workers &amp; congressional colleagues Wednesday to call for funding the Postal Service in the next Covid relief package – story by @KurtzPaul @KYWNewsradio #SaveUSPS https://t.co/9S36ScMXNd,2020-08-06 15:50:38,Twitter for iPhone,2,5,covid; 
I am proud to lead this effort along with my @TheBlackCaucus colleagues to expand the Earned Income Child Tax Credit.    These improvements would relieve our most vulnerable families during the coronavirus pandemic. https://t.co/w27TwLLeVw,2020-08-05 21:02:52,Twitter for iPhone,13,28,corona; 
3 MILLION Pennsylvanians have depended on unemployment benefits to get them through the coronavirus pandemic. Here are some ways to get help as we wait for Senate GOP stalling to end:  https://t.co/VJceROy5Ov,2020-08-04 22:25:17,Twitter for iPhone,3,1,corona; 
Congratulations to @PIDCphila for being awarded a $6780000 in federal funding for a Revolving Loan Fund (RLF) to lend to #Philly borrowers to alleviate sudden &amp; severe economic dislocation caused by #COVID_19.,2020-08-03 22:56:06,Twitter for iPhone,8,15,covid; 
Join us next Thursday August 6 to learn about the legal supports available to you while dealing with high utility costs during the #COVID_19 pandemic. https://t.co/UHtZw0BykE,2020-07-31 22:36:50,Twitter for iPhone,2,3,covid; 
I’ve voted for federal Covid relief funding &amp; am pleased @GovernorTomWolf’s administration will use a portion of it to help Pennsylvanians exercise our sacred right to vote. https://t.co/8Huj8xGlwQ,2020-07-31 22:00:38,Twitter for iPhone,3,11,covid; 
More Covid-19 testing is available in #Philadelphia! For a citywide list visit https://t.co/wqrgkltFaN https://t.co/JJqAvyRxxa,2020-07-31 18:33:04,Twitter Web App,8,8,covid;

#Covid_19 has had a disproportionate impact on communities of color. That’s why a vaccine trial that includes #Philly is seeking diverse participants: https://t.co/Befq7JkmAO,2020-07-27 23:20:24,Twitter for iPhone,4,2,covid; 
4 million Americans have confirmed cases of coronavirus. And still Trump &amp; Congressional Republicans have no real plan to protect lives &amp; livelihoods.   Pass the #HeroesAct now!,2020-07-23 21:34:19,Twitter for iPhone,2,7,corona; 
President Trump’s threat to cut off funding for the @WHO during the #COVID19 pandemic is counterproductive &amp; dangerous. I support @AppropsDems’ FY21 State &amp; Foreign Operations bill because it would restore funding for the WHO &amp; strengthen international health efforts. https://t.co/lw8dgNWaKS,2020-07-22 20:53:50,Twitter for iPhone,2,3,covid; 
We don’t have to choose between risking lives and closing schools indefinitely. The #HeroesAct would provide $100 BILLION in funding to help schools address the impact of #COVID19 and cover unexpected costs as they work to #ReopenSafely. https://t.co/Mp2l2ZpVGX,2020-07-20 22:34:09,Twitter for iPhone,5,10,covid; 
Earlier this morning I spoke with @NBCPhiladelphia about the legacy of civil rights hero @RepJohnLewis &amp; about what I’d like to see in the next #COVID19 relief package. https://t.co/OZ0YDL5niI,2020-07-20 21:41:44,Twitter for iPhone,3,11,covid;

2/ My agenda today also includes hosting a meeting with #Philly-area health care stakeholders to address operational challenges &amp; find solutions for our hospitals in the midst of #COVID19.  This is a follow-up to a meeting I convened in January before the pandemic: https://t.co/CysdzfVRWC,2020-07-17 20:12:10,Twitter for iPhone,3,5,covid; 
1/ Today I’m working on multiple fronts to help #Philly recover from #COVID19. This morning I questioned @SBAjovita and @stevenmnuchin1 about what we can do to ensure recovery for all small businesses. https://t.co/kdqEmTER0V,2020-07-17 20:09:51,Twitter Media Studio,6,9,covid;

1/ From #UnemploymentInsurance to #ChildCare to the #EITC — now more than ever our families are going to need a safety net to survive the COVID economy. #SolvingCOVIDCrisis,2020-07-16 21:14:01,Twitter for iPhone,3,5,covid; 
1/ I’ve voted for $3 trillion in urgent Covid relief. Now I’m asking for your help to ensure your taxpayer $$$ are being spent efficiently effectively &amp; equitably.   Report any waste fraud or online abuse here: https://t.co/TwpKshCndQ,2020-07-16 20:51:11,Twitter for iPhone,3,3,covid; 
GOOD NEWS: After I and Democratic colleagues called on the Trump-Pence administration to drop this rule ICE is doing exactly that! This is good for students who don’t have to risk exposure to Covid and good for Philadelphia home to so many universities. https://t.co/g3C8oMiGns,2020-07-14 22:07:45,Twitter for iPhone,1,7,covid;
