Proud of my friend @DrRandyFriese for winning re-election! You have done such incredible work for Arizona especially amidst the pandemic and I cannot wait to continue working alongside you to improve the lives of Southern Arizonans. #LD9 (pre-COVID picture) https://t.co/ufwteJaPZS,2020-11-04 19:15:05,Hootsuite Inc.,2,11,covid; 
Congratulations to my friend @EngelForArizona on her win yesterday! Kirsten is a fierce advocate for quality public education environmental protection a better-serving economy and a fairer criminal justice system. I can't wait to continue working with her!

We cannot let our guards down. COVID-19 is still out there and is still dangerous.   Stay home as much as possible wash your hands and wear a mask when you must leave the house. 😷#MaskUpAZ  https://t.co/K2KtJSFJyK,2020-10-26 17:35:04,Hootsuite Inc.,7,12,covid; 
We all want our lives &amp; the economy to return to normal — but we can't achieve that until we get #COVID19 under control. This means:  ✅ Financial relief for families ✅ Loans for small businesses  ✅ Support for frontline workers   We'll get it done—together. #Vote4AZ  #VoteBlue,2020-10-16 17:01:05,Hootsuite Inc.,4,5,covid; 
Too many families have lost a loved one to COVID-19. This is a disease that doesn't discriminate — we need to come together &amp; meet this moment.    #MaskUpAZ,2020-10-15 19:01:13,Hootsuite Inc.,3,16,covid; 
We each have a role in stopping the spread of COVID-19. Together we can get through this! #MaskUpAZ https://t.co/E1lEWiXafz,2020-10-02 18:40:03,Hootsuite Inc.,4,8,covid; 
5632 Arizonans are dead from #COVID19.  200000 Americans are dead. 7 million are infected in the US.   Instead of talking tax returns &amp; tweets Americans are starving for leadership. The choice is clear. #Biden2020 #Debates2020,2020-09-30 01:48:23,Twitter for iPhone,17,66,covid;

COVID-19 disproportionately affects America's Hispanic &amp; Latino population — but instead of rolling out a national pandemic strategy the President is busy campaigning...for the votes of the very people he is failing to serve while currently in office.   https://t.co/M2nZS7xPvH,2020-09-14 18:30:06,Hootsuite Inc.,3,8,covid; 
Our country is facing a series of challenges — the COVID-19 pandemic a collapsing economy and racial inequality. But if history proves one thing it's that when we stand united we can overcome anything. @JoeBiden &amp; @KamalaHarris understand that and they will #BuildBackBetter.,2020-08-17 20:00:44,Hootsuite Inc.,5,8,covid; 
Arizona: our daily numbers are still alarming. Please wear a mask. Practice social distancing. Take this virus seriously. We all play a part in preventing the spread of #COVID19.   https://t.co/DWvmaynouH,2020-07-29 19:00:38,Hootsuite Inc.,2,3,covid; 
Changing up the system in the middle of a crisis isn't a strategy — it is a recipe for disaster and will worsen our current situation. Once again this administration will not listen to experts. #COVID19  https://t.co/ctezxBMY6R,2020-07-16 17:59:15,Hootsuite Inc.,5,6,covid; 
This 4th of July you are safest at home. We have been witnessing a scary rise in COVID-19 cases; don't go adding to it by attending mass gatherings this weekend.,2020-07-04 00:15:08,Hootsuite Inc.,6,10,covid; 
#COVID19 doesn't care that it's a holiday weekend — if you aren't careful you will risk getting sick &amp; getting others sick. The more we work to slow the spread the sooner we can return to normalcy. It's up to us.,2020-07-03 17:05:19,Hootsuite Inc.,2,9,covid; 
The number of infections in Arizona surpassed 79000 yesterday and the state reported 1632 deaths. Today the numbers are exponentially higher.   Take this virus seriously. Wear a mask. Demonstrate that you care. #COVID19,2020-07-01 22:30:27,Hootsuite Inc.,7,14,covid; 
This virus is not going to go away on its own — we need to be vigilant and cooperative to get through it. Please wear your mask stay home as much as possible and avoid close encounters with others! #COVID19,2020-06-27 18:30:30,Hootsuite Inc.,2,11,covid; 
Arizona: we hit a record number of COVID-caused deaths today. Please wear a mask show respect to others' health and stay socially distanced! #COVID19,2020-06-25 00:10:03,Hootsuite Inc.,6,29,covid; 
To Trump campaigning is paramount. He only cares about power — not people. Otherwise why would he be visiting a state that has made nat'l news for record Covid-19 cases and NOT follow CDC guidelines at a 3000 person rally? https://t.co/jg9jgbakjL,2020-06-23 21:10:12,Hootsuite Inc.,15,32,covid; 
Just a few days after admitting he slowed down testing Trump is visiting AZ where COVID-19 cases and deaths are surging. He is unabashed in his priorities and is singlehandedly costing American families' lives and livelihoods. #VoteHimOut,2020-06-23 17:25:04,Hootsuite Inc.,5,23,covid; 
Remember: the COVID-19 incubation period is anywhere between 2-14 days. Get tested use common sense and follow CDC guidelines!  We must all fight together against this virus. #COVID19,2020-06-12 16:04:00,Hootsuite Inc.,1,3,covid; 
Regardless of the lies Donald Trump is telling us and himself our economy is suffering because of lack of leadership in the face of the coronavirus Americans need help not meaningless boasts. https://t.co/NqemKGrPWR,2020-06-10 20:25:14,Hootsuite Inc.,3,3,corona;

Our President has his priorities:   ❌100K+ Americans dead from COVID-19 = no action ❌ Rampant police brutality = condoned encouraged  ✅Twitter fact-checking and hiding his tweets = Executive Order outcry.   #VoteHimOut,2020-05-30 17:30:22,Hootsuite Inc.,5,11,covid; 
Now more than ever we must support the health workers on the front lines. On a small scale it means wearing a mask in public for the safety of yourself &amp; others but on a large scale it means demanding a better strategy from our government. #COVID19 https://t.co/d5K8ZlB9ij,2020-05-28 20:35:03,Hootsuite Inc.,2,1,covid; 
Contrary to popular belief there was no "miracle" and COVID-19 did not just "disappear."

Very proud of the efforts of the Navajo and Hopi Family COVID-19 Relief Fund — together they raised $4 million since March.

While the world &amp; our country gets swept up with coronavirus this administration has been busy slashing environmental protections.  This is totally unacceptable:   https://t.co/6eUxIxXmGc,2020-05-12 16:30:42,Hootsuite Inc.,1,1,corona; 
The #ACA is best positioned to respond to the #COVID19 crisis. We simply cannot let Republicans and the current Administration continue their attempts to gut it. It's time to act like real leaders and help struggling Americans not harm them. #DropTheLawsuit #ProtectOurCare,2020-05-08 02:20:04,Hootsuite Inc.,3,4,covid; 
President Trump botched our country’s response to coronavirus.  His ‘visits’ are poor attempts to campaign for his re-election.  https://t.co/gl7rtTIy7W,2020-05-06 16:35:07,Hootsuite Inc.,7,14,corona;

When will Arizona hit the COVID-19 peak? Models disagree about “when“ but not about “if.”  Please continue to stay home so we can continue flattening the curve!   https://t.co/yBv2DVeeSu,2020-04-28 19:00:25,Hootsuite Inc.,5,8,covid; 
If Trump wants to #ReopenAmerica for business he needs to remember that our economy is propelled by immigrants. Issuing another #ImmigrationBan should not be the priority right now. Instead he should help medical professionals get PPE and ramp up widespread testing. #COVID19,2020-04-21 19:40:22,Hootsuite Inc.,5,19,covid; 
What’s the difference between President Trump medical doctors and scientists?   Doctors &amp; scientists know more than the President about containing pandemics. Make sure your information comes from credible sources. #COVID19,2020-04-16 17:15:15,Hootsuite Inc.,5,11,covid;

The spread of coronavirus is scary and it can come with even more harrowing consequences — surprise medical bills.
