As we’ve highlighted for months as much as many state &amp; local governments have tried to claim that they are taking steps to save some lives from COVID-19 they have compromised countless other lives due to draconian restrictions based on fear &amp; hysteria. https://t.co/U3GYbgHiOb,2020-09-13 21:56:26,Twitter for iPhone,285,784,covid; 
And there appears to be no effort to obtain this information now that the state knows it is missing.  Arizonans should demand the sensitivity levels of our state’s COVID-19 tests. Otherwise we may not be able to trust our COVID-19 positive test results.,2020-09-12 23:42:06,Twitter for iPhone,128,336,covid; 
A recent report in the New York Times showed that 90% of COVID-19 positive results were non-infectious/false positives due to the high sensitivity of the tests (called the cycle threshold).  The cycle threshold for Arizona’s COVID-19 tests remains unknown. https://t.co/axFRvAP4Vb,2020-09-12 23:40:58,Twitter for iPhone,387,727,covid; 
Arizonans need to know what the cycle threshold is for our state’s COVID-19 PCR tests. https://t.co/394bddNjY0,2020-09-11 03:53:48,Twitter for iPhone,86,283,covid; 
Too many lives and livelihoods have not been valued and protected.  Too many businesses have been decimated.  Too many liberties have been lost.  Arizonans deserve freedom from some of the most oppressive COVID-19 restrictions in the nation. It’s past time to #ReOpenArizona. https://t.co/n5YPn4SM95,2020-09-11 01:25:28,Twitter for iPhone,235,614,covid; 
This year maybe more than recent years due to government reactions to COVID-19 we know that there are many men women and children who have contemplated suicide.  Our community is here for those who are having doubts or insecurities about their worth in this world. #AZ05 https://t.co/7q5vTJqsQQ,2020-09-10 20:35:41,TweetDeck,30,85,covid; 
Important thread on COVID-19 PCR test cycle thresholds/sensitivity.   Arizonans deserve to know the Ct for their PCR tests. https://t.co/h63RVlwkm1,2020-09-10 18:01:36,TweetDeck,62,128,covid; 
It’s time for a new approach in AZ one that values &amp; protects all life. We must give hope to the public &amp; set forth a plan to reopen the economy &amp;  remove oppressive gov't restrictions.   Right now the cure for COVID-19 has proved worse than the disease itself.  #ReOpenArizona https://t.co/7VyWItSn3X,2020-09-09 17:10:27,TweetDeck,304,634,covid; 
The mainstream media and radical left are at it again - engineering a new round of fear and hysteria over COVID-19.  This time it's over COVID-19 cases at college campuses.  Cases. Not hospitalizations. Not deaths. But cases. https://t.co/HPjQMfPYrm,2020-09-08 23:46:20,TweetDeck,263,570,covid; 
According to @Garrett_Archer from @abc15 the Arizona Department of Health Services has not kept a record of the cycle thresholds that determine the sensitivity of the COVID-19 PCR tests.  This is completely unacceptable. https://t.co/7nXR0FIMmZ,2020-09-08 20:03:41,TweetDeck,116,225,covid; 
Do you trust the mainstream media to give you information about COVID-19 that you can use to make informed decisions for you your family and your loved ones?,2020-09-08 03:45:15,Twitter for iPhone,1157,914,covid; 
According to a recent poll only about a third of registered voters trust the media for COVID-19 information.  Many in the mainstream media oppose President @realDonaldTrump’s efforts to give Americans the right to try hydroxychloroquine.  That should tell you everything. https://t.co/z9cFlGFHUc,2020-09-08 01:14:30,Twitter for iPhone,202,442,covid; 
Members of the Arizona media must start asking questions about the false COVID-19 positives in our state.   What is Arizona’s cycle threshold for PCR tests?!   How many of our reported positives should not have been categorized that way? https://t.co/2YI6DyMYf2,2020-09-08 00:27:24,Twitter for iPhone,380,744,covid; 
Americans’ trust in the accuracy of COVID-19 tests is rapidly declining with these reports.   Ask questions. Demand answers. Don’t assume that government and health officials know what they are doing when it comes to fielding and releasing test results. https://t.co/B7rDPAc0qx,2020-09-07 02:57:23,Twitter for iPhone,371,866,covid; 
Non-profit organizations across the U.S. are working hard to provide relief for Americans affected by the economic impacts of COVID-19.

Nothing can go wrong with health officials coming to your door right?

Masks provide cover for government and health officials who have been wrong so often with their COVID-19 predictions and edicts.  Your mask protects them not your community. #UnMaskArizona https://t.co/tAWhdT9ilc,2020-09-06 01:59:37,Twitter for iPhone,388,864,covid; 
The NYT recently reported that in MA/NV/NY up to 90% of COVID-19 positives were non-infectious based on the sensitivity of the cycle threshold for the PCR tests.  What percentage of ARIZONA COVID-19 PCR positive results do you think are false positive or non-infectious?,2020-09-05 21:07:57,Twitter for iPhone,111,119,covid; 
Arizonans need to demand answers from our local government officials about the basis for which they are compiling these positive COVID-19 results and about the sensitivity of the PCR tests for our state.,2020-09-05 16:50:13,TweetDeck,91,218,covid; 
First the NYT now the BBC picks up on the explosive story of FALSE COVID-19 POSITIVES.  It's become crystal clear that local officials were willing to devastate economies &amp; societies based on fear of the unknown-&amp; they were wrong on just about everything. https://t.co/A1UE6aCgQU,2020-09-05 16:47:45,TweetDeck,956,1463,covid;

Not even the COVID-19 shutdowns can stop the American economy from roaring back thanks to President @realDonaldTrump's pro-growth policies.  President Trump built a solid economy before COVID-19 and he is leading the great American comeback now.

It’s hard to believe how many of the Chinese Communist government’s tactics Arizona has emulated since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak.

Flash poll three parts. Please answer seriously. Part 1: How many people do you personally know who have died from #Covid?,2020-09-02 16:48:50,Twitter Web App,397,319,covid; 
Who in Arizona's state or local government or our media will investigate how many false positive COVID-19 cases have been reported in AZ?  We need to know the cycle threshold of our PCR tests to give Arizonans a more complete perspective on the testing sensitivity. https://t.co/ULZJbODhyq,2020-09-02 15:02:33,TweetDeck,522,1066,covid; 
President @realDonaldTrump and @GovRonDeSantis know that Dr. @SWAtlasHoover has the right perspective on COVID-19 and that he will tell the truth based on science data and common sense. https://t.co/VanDPE5PBX,2020-09-01 16:29:42,TweetDeck,139,361,covid;

Pivoting to flu season and tying COVID-19 efforts to the flu is one of the most dishonest movement of the goalposts the nation has seen over the last six months.   It's time to reopen Arizona and America.  Restore FREEDOM and #UnMaskArizona.,2020-08-31 22:33:17,TweetDeck,658,1427,covid; 
In March if Arizonans had known that part of our state and economy would have remained shut down entering September they would have never submitted to draconian restrictions and onerous mandates over COVID-19,2020-08-31 22:30:10,TweetDeck,1492,3888,covid; 
We found out that 90% of positive cases in 3 states "carried barely any virus."  Our policies-&amp; the insistence on these tests -are affecting MILLIONS of Americans and destroying countless lives &amp; livelihoods. We need an exit strategy from this COVID-19 pseudoscience IMMEDIATELY.,2020-08-31 21:07:49,TweetDeck,476,887,covid; 
ICYMI: Many government officials and health bureaucrats have been consumed with reporting on COVID-19 cases while refusing to put the numbers into perspective or to allow Americans to push back against these unprecedented methods. https://t.co/t8qFtkEex9,2020-08-31 21:05:50,TweetDeck,248,497,covid; 
President Donald J. Trump has advocated for Americans to have the right to try hydroxychloroquine in the ongoing fight against COVID-19 but this drug has unfortunately become too politicized including in Arizona. https://t.co/hW4Qbto0mK,2020-08-31 16:20:45,TweetDeck,306,731,covid; 
.@AlexBerenson has been at the forefront of COVID-19 Team Reality by championing the science &amp; data behind the hysteria.

Another takeaway:  New York has the highest number of COVID-19 deaths in the country;  New York has the second-highest deaths per 100000 people in the country.  Governor Cuomo is the last person in the nation to be giving COVID-19 health advice or patting himself on the back. https://t.co/IJfJzdgGCK,2020-08-30 20:21:59,Twitter for iPhone,254,610,covid; 
Arizona's cure for COVID-19 was much worse than the disease.   There are countless stories showing that our state did not value &amp; protect all lives.

Arizona has mandated that some bars but not others close because of the existence of COVID-19.  This is not fair nor is it scientific in any way.

Arizona is one of the most restrictive states in the U.S. due to the government's response to COVID-19 &amp; the effects on small businesses are devastating.

Dr. Scott Atlas has had a measured approach to COVID-19 in the face of mainstream media hysteria. His credentials are unmatched &amp; he is a welcomed addition to the White House team.

Fauci is an unelected bureaucrat who’s been wrong on just about everything when it comes to COVID-19.  Any COVID-related deliberations are better off w/o Fauci in the room.

There's no scientific evidence to show that masks contribute to decreasing COVID-19 cases. Rather there's other health concerns that might be evolving w/ increased mask usage.  It's time for the mask mandates to come to an end. Arizonans should value freedom more than tyranny.,2020-08-26 19:48:40,TweetDeck,308,785,covid; 
Many government officials and health bureaucrats are applauding themselves for mask mandates that they claim have slowed the spread of COVID-19.  COVID-19 science and data disagree with that flawed conclusion. https://t.co/lXbxlqu8BP,2020-08-26 19:46:00,TweetDeck,381,758,covid;

Public health officials and the government officials who have blindly followed their advice throughout this COVID-19 outbreak have lost a great amount of credibility thanks to the number of times they have been flat out wrong in their dire predictions. https://t.co/JG88Dyyzap,2020-08-24 17:59:11,TweetDeck,199,509,covid;

The mask is a symbol of freedom versus totalitarianism.   There are many jurisdictions around the country and world with more mask compliance than Maricopa County that have large numbers of COVID-19 cases.   The mainstream media and radical left ignores these data points.,2020-08-20 00:10:31,Twitter for iPhone,93,328,covid; 
The goalposts have been dramatically moved with this COVID-19 hysteria - especially in Arizona.   We have moved from “15 days to slow the spread” to “No more cases - your freedoms and livelihoods can be sacrificed to accomplish our mission.”,2020-08-20 00:09:55,Twitter for iPhone,261,615,covid;

Dr. Atlas is not “new.” He’s been giving sound advice since the media hysteria over COVID-19 started in March.

They think it’s good for business &amp; more importantly they believe it’s good for their anti-@realDonaldTrump politics. https://t.co/TJwv9PTuuZ,2020-07-11 23:49:32,Twitter for iPhone,1397,2575,covid; 
As more Americans do their own research about COVID-19 members of the mainstream media and the radical left are increasing their hysteria and distortions to force more shutdowns of our society and economy.

More national hysteria over COVID-19 numbers including more Arizona finger pointing.  Maybe the national media doesn't realize that AZ's total mortality rate has gone from 4.43% on 6/1 to 1.79% today.  And that's not even taking into account CDC estimates of 10x infections... https://t.co/41JcYdct5b,2020-07-11 16:32:25,TweetDeck,561,1098,covid; 
➡️ Last month the CDC estimated that the U.S. may only be identifying 1/10 of positive COVID-19 cases.  ● IF that estimation is applied to ARIZONA the percent of positive COVID-19 cases hospitalized would be .48%;  ● and the total mortality rate would be .18%.

Distorting the truth helps no one. It only leads to more panic and hysteria that creates more problems than those we are trying to solve with the COVID-19 outbreak.   Let's help our most vulnerable not scare everyone out of their minds.,2020-07-11 16:23:32,TweetDeck,748,2767,covid;

National praise for Arizona’s own @DavidCaltabiano.  He’s setting the standard for local reporting amongst our local media with the COVID-19 situation. https://t.co/Rjbs8bmyt5,2020-07-11 06:39:31,Twitter for iPhone,65,192,covid; 
Her fear mongering and attempts to escalate the hysteria over COVID-19 in our state must end.

COVID-19 is serious - especially for our older population. Yet we know much more now about how to protect our most vulnerable from COVID-19. Arizonans are smart &amp; resourceful.

More testing ➡️ More cases detected ➡️ lower hospitalization rate ➡️ lower mortality rate.  This is what you need to know about Arizona's current COVID-19 situation.

Maybe instead of creating more hysteria in Arizona the NYT should ask more questions about why New York's and New Jersey's COVID-19 death rate are still the highest in the nation.  ➡️ NJ: 170.9 deaths/100k pop. ➡️ NY: 164.9 deaths/100k pop. ➡️ Arizona: 25.5 deaths/100k pop.,2020-07-09 02:58:55,TweetDeck,199,432,covid;
