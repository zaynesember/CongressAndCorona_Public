The time is now to bring relief to our country but Senate Democrats blocked the $300 billion COVID-19 stimulus package. Democrats should stop playing political games with relief for American small businesses. https://t.co/vUJ4BOmLN5,2020-09-22 14:25:01,Sprout Social,0,4,covid;

Democrats in Washington blocked COVID-19 relief for millions of Americans while demanding a far-left wish list. Democrats again chose partisanship and a radical agenda over results for the American people. https://t.co/0EYnyDQIFk,2020-08-11 17:21:01,Sprout Social,0,3,covid;
