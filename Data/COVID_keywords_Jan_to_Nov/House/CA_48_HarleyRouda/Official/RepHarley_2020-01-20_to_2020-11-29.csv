The stakes are too high to shortchange small businesses during the #COVID19 crisis. I'm fighting for #SmallBizRelief that helps working families — not billion-dollar corporations.

A math lesson for @realDonaldTrump:  The United States is ~4.25% of the world's population.  ~30% of global #COVID19 cases are in the United States &amp; ~20% of global #COVID19 deaths are in the United States  That doesn't add up to equal a "perfect" response.,2020-04-14 22:43:12,Twitter Web App,40,106,covid; 
No one should feel unsafe in their community — especially not in their own home. During #COVID19 we must ensure that those most vulnerable to #domesticviolence are safe.  @HouseDemocrats and @HouseGOP passed #VAWA a year ago...  @senatemajldr — do your damn job and pass the bill.,2020-04-09 22:16:43,Twitter Web App,8,26,covid;

Americans need clean air &amp; clean drinking water now more than ever.   This is a horribly misguided directive from an Administration hell bent on protecting corporate interests NOT people.
