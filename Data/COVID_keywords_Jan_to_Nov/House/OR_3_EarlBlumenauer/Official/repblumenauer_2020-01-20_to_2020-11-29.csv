With COVID-19 on the rise we should provide monthly direct cash payments of $2000/month for at least the next 6 months to keep families afloat.  It’s common-sense policy that will save lives.,2020-11-13 21:03:44,Twitter Web App,566,3260,covid; 
Given COVID's impact on our economy it has never been more important to pass transformative solutions to the #HousingCrisis.

Hope Trump's team of doctors includes a chiropractor to treat the whiplash from his incoherent and erratic decision making.  COVID relief might be a game to Trump and his fellow Republicans but it isn't to the millions of American workers and small businesses that need help NOW.,2020-10-07 20:02:32,Twitter Web App,18,104,covid; 
While Trump gets free world-class COVID-19 treatment in his ivory tower he just rejected bipartisan #stimulus relief efforts for the rest of the country. Here’s what this means for you:,2020-10-06 20:22:17,Twitter Web App,362,919,covid; 
Like millions of Americans with COVID-19 Trump now has another pre-existing condition.  If he is successful in overturning the Affordable Care Act in court all of those people could be denied health insurance.

Another telling example of empty boasting stunning incompetence &amp; cruelty as @realdonaldtrump threatens to deny badly needed resources to cities hit hard by COVID-19.

Just like with COVID Republicans on the House floor are arguing that Trump's sabotage of our mail system is a hoax.   Tell that to the 500+ Oregonians who've told me harrowing stories about how mail delays have already created serious problems in their lives.  #SaveThePostOffice,2020-08-22 19:45:13,Twitter Web App,56,141,covid; 
You've got to ask yourself what planet Republicans live on as they continue to block more COVID relief.  Don’t they hear constituents' fears? Don’t they get the economic trauma? How can they ignore the most urgent set of interrelated crises in our history?  People need help NOW!,2020-08-07 21:59:28,Twitter Web App,31,165,covid; 
Trump wants you to think more COVID testing is unnecessary while he is tested daily.  Trump wants you to think #VoteByMail is fraudulent while he does it often.  Trump wants your kid to go back to school while his kid's school stays closed.  We must vote this fraud out of office!,2020-08-06 02:10:16,Twitter Web App,99,302,covid; 
Disgraceful. Trump thinks the staggering coronavirus death toll in the United States "is what it is".

It's unfathomable that @SenateGOP has allowed $600/week in unemployment insurance to expire.  Millions of Americans are still unemployed because of Trump's disastrous COVID-19 response.

I worked w/ @RepDelBene @cathymcmorris &amp; other #PNW members to urge the Trump admin to address the growing demand of ventilators in our region which we severely lack.
