Watch #DonaldTrump's @CDCgov Director confirm that a wall will do nothing to stop the #CoronavirusPandemic.  In fact xenophobia and social stigmatizing will only compound the crisis. https://t.co/03vENY5yCN https://t.co/jOrpm1zKAg,2020-03-13 15:11:51,Twitter Web App,19,58,corona; 
Trump's major policy solutions have been building a wall and burying his head in the sand.   We will fight #coronavirus by coming together following the facts and putting #familiesfirst. https://t.co/8ZxV7Gq5lU,2020-03-13 14:23:25,Twitter Web App,18,47,corona;

Trump is in court RIGHT NOW trying to take #healthcare away from millions of Americans.  You can't separate the #Covid_19 crisis from his dangerous health care policies that could leave even more Americans uninsured and unprotected. #ProtectOurCare #ACA #Obamacare https://t.co/OJrFX8SzMH,2020-03-03 21:39:01,Twitter Web App,54,92,covid;

You don't start preparing for an emergency after it's already begun. Trump proposed slashing almost $700 MILLION from the @CDCgov eliminated critical positions charged with managing pandemics &amp; just sent Congress a #coronavirus response funding request that's totally inadequate. https://t.co/uUi3SyCDhz,2020-02-26 18:24:46,Twitter Web App,60,115,corona;
