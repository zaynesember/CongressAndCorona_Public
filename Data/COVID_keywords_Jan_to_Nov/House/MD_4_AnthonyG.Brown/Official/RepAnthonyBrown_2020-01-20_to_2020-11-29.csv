America is more than capable of defeating #COVID19 - we need a coherent organized strategy to marshal supplies and get them to the frontlines.  No more blame. No more spin.

As we work to aggressively expand testing @drJoshS is correct we need a strategy to limit the spread of #COVID19 in our communities once it's found.  Our approach must be comprehensive quick and precise. If we work together and #StayHome we can defeat this virus. https://t.co/4qYedo7Zei,2020-04-02 23:17:20,Twitter Web App,4,10,covid;

Using the Defense Production Act to ensure medical professionals have vital supplies isn’t radical but rather acknowledges the realities on the ground.   This crisis calls for decisive leadership. We can't wait for the situation to get worse we must prepare now. #COVID19 https://t.co/WtX2sXKAMY,2020-04-01 00:04:45,Twitter Web App,7,14,covid;

Lack of supplies isn’t just an issue in MD it’s an issue everywhere in this country and the federal government must step up.
