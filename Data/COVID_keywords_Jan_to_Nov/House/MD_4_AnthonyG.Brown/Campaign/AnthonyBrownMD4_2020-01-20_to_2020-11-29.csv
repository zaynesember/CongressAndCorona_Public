.@realdonaldtrump should stop blaming states for the lack of #Coronavirus testing. He needs to mobilize the federal government to increase our testing capacity so we can safely reopen the economy.   These are literally life and death decisions. https://t.co/JxGBfa5TsT,2020-04-20 16:34:30,TweetDeck,3,4,corona; 
We need a dramatic increase in testing to re-open our economy &amp; keep people safe. Without more testing we can't properly track the spread of #Coronavirus.   The federal government must keep its promises and ramp up testing. https://t.co/qRIjg3hUPP,2020-04-17 20:08:10,TweetDeck,1,7,corona; 
I stand with @iupat_dc51 and @GoIUPAT to put #WorkersFirst as we provide more relief during the #COVID19 crisis.  I'll keep fighting to: ✔️ Expand healthcare coverage ✔️ Protect worker retirement plans ✔️ Invest in our infrastructure   We need to take bold action now. https://t.co/g3a3DpRfrp,2020-04-10 15:05:56,TweetDeck,8,16,covid; 
#Coronavirus is exacerbating the racial disparities - in health care in our schools &amp; in our economy - that have already existed. This means that people of color are suffering disproportionately &amp; not receiving the testing or treatment they need.  This has to be addressed now https://t.co/uMyCEys9si,2020-04-07 17:01:11,TweetDeck,4,4,corona; 
MDers out of work due to the #coronavirus can now apply for unemployment benefits right now to put money in their pockets.  We’re also working to expand benefits - giving workers $600 more a week for 4 months. We will keep fighting to get working families through this crisis. https://t.co/lln2jyrAo6,2020-03-26 19:35:00,TweetDeck,4,7,corona; 
The most effective way to slow #Coronavirus and save lives is to practice social distancing stay at home and follow the advice of medical professionals. Prematurely forcing people back to work could kill potentially millions and have a huge economic impact. https://t.co/Y4k6uXwcbq,2020-03-24 16:05:00,TweetDeck,1,5,corona; 
The Affordable Care Act has helped millions to get the care they need. It's been critical during the #COVID19 response. But #Obamacare is on the ballot again in 2020 - and we must continue the fight for affordable health care for all. #ProtectOurCare  https://t.co/GOG3TLzZb0,2020-03-23 17:23:00,TweetDeck,1,12,covid; 
In the UK over 60 companies including Rolls-Royce and Jaguar committed to help produce 20000 ventilators in just 2 weeks.   Maryland and other states face critical equipment shortages. We have to mobilize the entire country to respond to #Coronavirus  https://t.co/8jppOJEbHq,2020-03-20 17:15:00,TweetDeck,3,10,corona; 
I support the decision by @GovLarryHogan to postpone Maryland's primary elections until June 2nd. Our hard-earned right to vote is sacred but I believe this is a necessary step to keep people safe from #coronavirus.

Trump delayed #coronavirus testing to artificially keep the numbers of infections down in order to help his reelection  Outrageous. This pandemic is worse because of Trump   As our health care providers work to stop the spread Democrats will make testing free for everyone https://t.co/JAJI2C9UXI,2020-03-13 21:02:00,TweetDeck,5,15,corona; 
Trump’s proposed budget would cut $700M from the CDC severely jeopardizing our ability to fight the Coronavirus outbreak House Democrats recognize this is wrong. I will continue advocating for spending that properly addresses this public health crisis.  https://t.co/m74Rh56sYo,2020-02-27 21:59:58,TweetDeck,2,10,corona; 
Americans need a coordinated fully-funded whole-of-government response to keep them and their loved ones safe. The President’s request for coronavirus response funding is long overdue and completely inadequate to the scale of this emergency. https://t.co/NpGThQwtVF,2020-02-25 13:21:39,Twitter for iPhone,58,185,corona;
