.@RealDonaldTrump's tweets are childish and don't help whatsoever in addressing the #coronavirus crisis.  Instead of online attacks the President should focus on getting his day job done: more tests more personal protective equipment more respirators for states. NOW. https://t.co/7ISGZMG68R,2020-03-17 14:56:30,TweetDeck,28,147,corona;

@diverdutch @aliasvaughn According to doctors and the @CDC coronavirus (COVID-19) is a new disease and we are still learning more including if those who have contracted the virus develop a protective antibody or if the virus mutates.   Please continue to check the @CDC's FAQ. https://t.co/yaCcmMdKkJ,2020-03-13 23:00:41,TweetDeck,0,1,covid; corona;

Self-reporting #coronavirus symptoms to your doctor is important for your safety and the safety of others in our community.  If you do not have symptoms follow @CDC guidelines: practice good hygiene &amp; regularly wash hands avoid individuals who are sick &amp; large crowds. https://t.co/KP7JMuTfvT,2020-03-12 22:51:44,Twitter Web App,5,7,corona;

You can’t wash your hands and prevent illnesses like #coronavirus if you don’t have water. That’s why I led a letter with @RepDebDingell &amp; @RashidaTlaib urging relief for Americans facing high water bills or shut-offs. https://t.co/8SIDVominE https://t.co/oLViTWCWnT,2020-03-12 19:44:13,Twitter Web App,139,523,corona; 
You can’t wash your hands and prevent illnesses like #coronavirus if you don’t have water. I am working with Congress and local officials to restore water to any home that has experienced water shut-offs. Access to clean affordable water should be a right—not a privilege. https://t.co/fFTiC6qGMz,2020-03-12 19:33:18,Twitter Web App,38,234,corona; 
In the richest country in the world #paidsickdays for all workers should be a right. Americans shouldn't have to choose between a paycheck and getting others sick. With the coronavirus outbreak I am working to expand paid sick leave for workers. https://t.co/wKzgB5SMK5,2020-03-11 17:01:23,Twitter Web App,11,30,corona; 
Pleased that the U.S. House passed a coronavirus emergency aid bill. This package will provide $8.3 billion in funding to ensure Americans are protected from this public health crisis.
