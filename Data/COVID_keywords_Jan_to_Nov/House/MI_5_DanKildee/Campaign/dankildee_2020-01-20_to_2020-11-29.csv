We are living through a global pandemic. Now is not the time to cut millions of people off from unemployment insurance who are out of work because of this health and economic crisis. #COVID19  https://t.co/EwWY56op3P,2020-07-23 23:00:49,Twitter Web App,2,1,covid; 
As people continue to deal with the impact of the #coronavirus they shouldn't have to worry about losing access to water. Now is not the time for obscenely high water bills and water shut offs especially for those who were already struggling the hardest. https://t.co/2dYwwv7O2b,2020-05-29 13:00:00,Twitter Web App,2,2,corona; 
For my hometown of Flint the #coronavirus pandemic represents a crisis on top of the crisis. We must do more to help families weather this pandemic especially the most vulnerable. https://t.co/brbDZ8UYk7,2020-05-28 17:30:09,Twitter Web App,4,5,corona; 
During times of crisis America has persevered when we stood together. Now is not the time for partisanship in the middle of a global pandemic. For us to get through this we must remember that the enemy is the #coronavirus not each other. https://t.co/c6kwQcmNZP,2020-05-14 20:07:43,Twitter Web App,4,9,corona; 
Thank you @Rihanna @BigSean &amp; everyone who are fighting #COVID19. Communities of color are disproportionately hit the hardest by the coronavirus. Cities like Flint &amp; Detroit greatly benefit from this help but we must continue to push for further relief. https://t.co/smtbC5v9JI,2020-05-11 21:17:56,Twitter Web App,20,20,covid; corona; 
There has been a racial disparity in health outcomes in this country for a long time. That's why I'm fighting alongside fellow Dems to get help from the fed gov for minority communities like Flint that #COVID19 is disproportionately sickening. https://t.co/wPUngOryhD,2020-04-10 14:25:30,Twitter Web App,14,20,covid; 
#COVIDー19 rips the cover off the inequities in our society. Flint was already reeling from a water crisis. We must recognize that part of the resolution of this crisis is to right some of the past wrongs of inequity in places like Flint and Detroit https://t.co/xWzItYGghj,2020-04-09 17:08:00,Twitter Web App,10,17,covid; 
It's so great to see @MI_Dems State Rep. Tyrone Carter on @cnn a moment ago looking strong as he recovers from #COVID19.,2020-04-07 14:59:51,Twitter Web App,1,4,covid;
