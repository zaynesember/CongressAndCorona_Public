10/ And why when the COVID-driven downturn came last spring one of the first things the Trump administration did was inject tax payer $ to try and prop up the oil industry.  https://t.co/Tw0z1Exe1f,2020-11-21 13:52:30,Twitter Web App,4,20,covid; 
If you are encouraging people not to wear masks and social distance you are responsible for needless death.  If you are denying the legitimacy of Biden's victory you putting our democracy at risk.  If you sit silently you are complicit.  Stand up.  History is watching.,2020-11-19 15:01:28,Twitter Web App,76,397,social distance; 
Really important thread to read as you think about how to minimize COVID spread and protect not only your loved ones but other people's loved ones as well. https://t.co/69nO492HdD,2020-11-18 21:21:53,Twitter Web App,22,72,covid; 
11. And if you're feeling particularly brave and patriotic consider defending objective truth and the germ theory of disease.  Encourage people to wear masks and social distance.  Thank Dr. Fauci.,2020-11-15 15:48:40,Twitter Web App,5,85,social distance; 
Phone banking right now.  Just talked to a woman who was totally congested and in tears.  Said she isn't able to vote because she has COVID.  I'm choked up now.    Wear a mask.  Stay safe.  Lead with Love &amp; we'll beat this thing together.,2020-11-03 19:06:27,Twitter Web App,41,509,covid; 
Not at all surprising - but maddening given how many of my colleagues have chosen to politicize mask wearing.   That lack of political leadership is rapidly becoming one of if not the biggest cause of COVID spread. https://t.co/EJGVymWdCB,2020-10-23 19:22:53,Twitter Web App,16,81,covid; 
7/ When COVID first hit our shores it surged in densely populated cities... as airborne communicable diseases are inclined to do.  The fact that urban areas tend to have Democratic leadership is correlation not causation.,2020-10-11 15:21:34,Twitter Web App,12,117,covid; 
5/ Because it's not like young people are immune from COVID; they are just less susceptible.  You're only 1/6th as likely to die playing Russian roulette than shooting yourself with a fully loaded 6-shooter but only an idiot would conclude that everyone should play RR.,2020-10-11 15:17:46,Twitter Web App,14,122,covid; 
4/ But the GBD is in many ways worse.  It advocates for the social isolation of our most vulnerable so that we can kill young people.  Seriously.  Exposing a greater % of people with lower % infection rates to COVID leads to more death.,2020-10-11 15:14:55,Twitter Web App,8,81,covid; 
2/ It is a heaping stinking pile of junk science advocating that we isolate the sick and the elderly and pretend that COVID doesn't affect young healthy people in the name of "restarting" the economy and herd immunity.,2020-10-11 15:12:32,Twitter Web App,11,130,covid; 
The only reasonable conclusion to take from all these @GOP Senators refusing to get COVID tests is that they think it's more important to ensure a quorum and jam a SCOTUS seat than to follow basic public health guidance to help ensure their colleagues &amp; staff don't die.,2020-10-09 22:51:13,Twitter Web App,233,692,covid; 
A lot of people at my workplace who don't wear masks and have called COVID a hoax got COVID today.    Please don't ignore science.  Wear a mask.  Wash your hands.  Stay safe.,2020-10-03 01:16:03,Twitter for Android,164,973,covid; 
“The... president of the United States was the single largest driver of misinformation around Covid... there are real-world dire health implications.”  e.g. Trump and his @GOP sycophants and amplifiers are a direct risk to your health.  https://t.co/BDdnC0p7D0,2020-10-01 12:38:16,Twitter Web App,30,124,covid; 
15/ Namely: Test.  Contact Trace.  Wear a mask.  Social distance.  Provide quarantine housing for those who are infected.  We don't need to do any science to know whether that works - those countries have already proven it works.,2020-09-29 13:38:21,Twitter Web App,11,50,social distance; 
12/ We've learned a lot about ventilator management and treatment but there is simply no way that a 30x increase in COVID infection rates doesn't overload hospitals.  To assume death rates will be &lt;6% is naive at best evil at worst.,2020-09-29 13:33:52,Twitter Web App,10,48,covid; 
9/ To be sure there are more infections we don't know about.  And the excess deaths above average suggest that our death rate from COVID is also substantially undercounted.  But let's go with the data we have.  https://t.co/CSnXfebd6D,2020-09-29 13:28:56,Twitter Web App,10,33,covid; 
8/ So now let's do some math.  As of this morning according to Johns Hopkins there are just over 7 million confirmed COVID cases in the United States or ~2.2% of the population.  Over 200000 Americans have died or 2.9% of those infected. https://t.co/b05R2FJ6Zv,2020-09-29 13:26:12,Twitter Web App,9,35,covid; 
There is a very dangerous conversation going on suggesting that the path to beating COVID is through herd immunity.  This is massively dangerous and will lead to the death of millions of Americans.  Facts matter.  Here are the ones you need (thread):,2020-09-29 13:08:12,Twitter Web App,148,451,covid; 
"...[Casten] display[s] extensive knowledge of the issues facing the manufacturing economic and trade issues that face local biz...

9/ Now to the current moment.  We've lost more Americans to COVID-19 this week than we lost on 9/11.,2020-09-11 14:07:53,Twitter Web App,4,40,covid; 
15/ First of all perhaps the only good thing about COVID is that it slowed down the rate of school shootings.  It turns out it is politically easier to keep kids out of schools than to keep guns out of schools.  Thanks NRA.  https://t.co/bqWuL93TmU,2020-08-27 22:09:31,Twitter Web App,14,56,covid; 
Worth reading this thread to understand COVID risks to kids and the risks of going back to school without sufficient testing PPE and social distancing.    And don't forget that lots of people in schools aren't kids. https://t.co/2pl3tJlyK2,2020-08-09 13:17:11,Twitter for Android,9,41,covid; 
"...Republicans spent months believing that Covid-19 was a blue-state problem not relevant to people they cared about. By the time they realized that the pandemic was exploding in the Sun Belt it was too late to avoid disaster.",2020-08-04 17:49:26,Twitter Web App,4,24,covid; 
1/ On April 2 of this year @FEMA provided a telephone briefing to the Region V (midwest) Congressional delegation during which time we were told that PPE ventilators and other critical COVID materiel were being preferentially dispatched to developing "hotspots".,2020-08-01 20:35:08,Twitter Web App,17,58,covid; 
The suggestion that Jared Kushner may have intentionally allowed COVID-19 to run rampant in blue states has direct relevance to #IL06 and answers I still have not received from @FEMA.    Thread: https://t.co/YJ3MYI9KM9 https://t.co/mAKgweL53J,2020-08-01 20:32:37,Twitter Web App,255,621,covid; 
I'm truly sorry for Herman Cain's family.  And I'm truly sad that Louis Gohmert got COVID.  But I have absolutely no sympathy nor tolerance for people who are willingly not wearing masks that would protect others from the viruses they are carrying.,2020-07-30 14:41:05,Twitter Web App,126,935,covid; 
7/ 150000 Americans are dead as a result of that failure.  Last week we lost twice as many Americans as we lost on 9/11.  Not because we don't have the tools to get COVID under control but because the Trump WH is incapable of leadership.,2020-07-30 12:28:04,Twitter Web App,14,68,covid; 
There seems to be a bit of confusion about the prospects for the economy right now so let's make this simple.  There is only one way to get the US economy going again: get COVID-19 under control.  Trump's utter failure to do so is why the prospects are so bleak.  Thread:,2020-07-30 12:18:15,Twitter Web App,121,470,covid; 
This is tragic.  Kids can get COVID.  Kids can spread COVID.  Especially but not only kids over 10 years old.  Be safe everybody.   https://t.co/0OzrDNfM1E,2020-07-28 11:30:32,Twitter Web App,38,101,covid;

One in four teachers is at elevated risks for COVID-19.  I want my kids back in school as much as any parent.  But I couldn't live with myself if that desire caused needless death.   https://t.co/bdb7n1xCV5,2020-07-13 14:21:30,Twitter Web App,20,108,covid; 
For those of you (like me) who've wondered about whether the surge in COVID cases is going to lead to a surge in deaths this is worth the read.  And this particular paragraph &amp; chart is frightening. https://t.co/q8cW38Lyer https://t.co/OAxidIryZw,2020-06-27 20:46:34,Twitter Web App,6,19,covid;

7/ If the @GOP's efforts to repeal the ACA had succeeded fewer Americans who have contracted COVID would have had insurance and even more Americans would be dead today.  https://t.co/SudqrPcUQI,2020-06-26 13:04:04,Twitter Web App,3,24,covid; 
Wow.  At the start of COVID-19 I frequently told people that what you do today will determine who is alive tomorrow.  Nature paper confirms that global lockdowns saved 1 - 3 million lives.

We won't get through COVID without collective sacrifice to the greater good.   That's really hard but I'm so proud of Illinois for being at the head of that class of decency science and kind-hearted public spirit.  Keep up the good work folks.  https://t.co/ogV12Z0lM5,2020-05-27 13:38:47,Twitter Web App,80,414,covid; 
6/ So now for (simple) algebra.  Assume that most of the population has not yet been exposed to COVID.  That means most people will test negative for COVID antibodies and are NOT protected if the economy reopens and they are exposed.,2020-05-21 14:23:00,Twitter Web App,7,11,covid; 
The US is 4% of the world's population and now running ~1/3 of daily COVID deaths.  And while deaths in the rest of the world slowly come down we're not.

South Korea and Vietnam have a combined population ~50% of the US.  They have had &lt;1% as many deaths from COVID as the US.  That's pretty sick.  It's not where a storm starts that matters but how we prepare for the one we knew was coming Senator. https://t.co/On5SlM3n9M,2020-05-06 19:57:26,Twitter Web App,43,187,covid; 
16/ Fourth direct OSHA to develop a consistent set of workplace safety rules for a world that doesn't yet have a COVID vaccine.  Rules for social distancing workflow ingress/egress are vastly more important for public health than just providing liability waivers to employers.,2020-05-04 15:18:07,Twitter Web App,6,25,covid; 
One of the great perks of my job is the access to experts.  Over the last month I've lost track of how many public health experts have helped us evaluate COVID-19; what we know what we should have done what we should do.  A brief thread on what I've learned:,2020-05-04 14:20:08,Twitter Web App,46,155,covid; 
At the same time we need to ensure that the resources we are providing to hospitals small businesses and so many others flow to people in need and not to antiquated funding formulas that penalize high-population states like IL.  COVID-19 follows people; the money should too.,2020-05-01 21:41:27,Twitter Web App,4,12,covid; 
Today I led a bipartisan letter joined by 41 Mayors Village Presidents and County Board Chairs to House and Senate leadership asking them to ensure that our next COVID package includes local funding and distributes funds on a per-capita basis so as not to disadvantage IL. https://t.co/Ikd1oMZp1o,2020-05-01 21:34:06,Twitter Web App,27,139,covid; 
This serves only to highlight the managerial disaster that is the Trump WH and their response to COVID.  Who is in charge? Azar? Pence? Polowczyz?  Kushner? Bueller? https://t.co/VxFZ58rbba,2020-04-27 12:55:07,Twitter for Android,15,83,covid; 
Second the % of positive test results is finally going down.  No doubt there are many more COVID-positive Americans than COVID positive tests but this MAY mean we're expanding testing beyond the most urgent &amp; symptomatic: https://t.co/w7dL0KMsm3,2020-04-26 19:21:06,Twitter Web App,1,14,covid; 
A few COVID-19 statistics I'm watching and cause for some (cautious) hopefulness:    First US testing rates are finally ramping up.  Need to make sure it sustains and still not where they need to be but finally moving in the right direction. https://t.co/leW19kQqcV,2020-04-26 19:18:13,Twitter Web App,4,38,covid; 
This is especially pernicious in COVID funding since it causes resources to flow where the people (and therefore virus-hosts) aren't.  That's why @RepBillFoster and I are pushing for per-capita federal allocation.  https://t.co/q83QiBtkGN https://t.co/hvokEOePdB,2020-04-23 15:38:21,Twitter Web App,6,24,covid; 
2/ "80% of the patients I see test positive for COVID-19.  I know the outside of my mask is infected.  But I have to save my mask every day in a brown bag with my name on it to use again the next day",2020-04-21 13:23:02,Twitter Web App,16,96,covid; 
Yesterday I spoke to a constituent who is a critical care specialist. He tested positive for COVID-19 and hasn't worked in 10 days.  He's a immigrant from North Africa.

COVID tests per capita as of COB yesterday.  Responsibly ending the stay at home orders and re-opening the economy is going to require massive increases in testing &amp; getting to the best-in-class end of this list.  Let's do this. https://t.co/HmkGvExa3E,2020-04-20 15:05:50,Twitter Web App,17,48,covid; 
Look a lot of people are hurting right now and we're doing a ton to ease credit.  But the collapse in oil &amp; gas demand from COVID is a harbinger of the collapse coming from renewables efficiency &amp; conservation.,2020-04-20 13:58:50,Twitter Web App,1,13,covid; 
There are only two things that can happen if you attend or encourage people to attend protests to open up the economy: you get sick with COVID-19 and/or you cause someone else to.  That's it.  You will be liable for deaths.,2020-04-19 14:09:51,Twitter Web App,133,530,covid; 
This COVID-driven annihilation of the O&amp;G sector is a foreshadowing of what renewables efficiency &amp; conservation is bringing next. Good for consumers but disastrous for the sector.    "one has to go back to the 1930s to find anything comparable"  https://t.co/liL529o3pL,2020-04-14 17:24:21,Twitter Web App,11,30,covid; 
Holy smokes.  “The last time demand for oil contracted during the financial crisis in 2008 to 2009 demand fell by 1.3m barrels of oil a day. But Covid-19 could cause oil demand to fall by more than five times as much.”  https://t.co/sROFtbeiwM,2020-04-13 17:21:18,Twitter Web App,10,31,covid; 
In non-COVID news: the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has initiated a weakening of PURPA the law that provides fair market access to non-utility generators.  Their plan is based on shoddy logic and exceeds their jurisdiction. My letter to FERC: https://t.co/OtTYJaInLO,2020-04-08 15:10:05,Twitter Web App,4,10,covid; 
14/ That is a sectoral issue that needs to be dealt with and we should of course make sure to look out for those jobs in the oil &amp; gas sector that are at risk from COVID just as we do in other sectors of the economy.,2020-04-03 14:28:33,Twitter Web App,4,2,covid; 
11/ What's worse many of the unconventional (e.g. fracking) players have relied on a lot of high-yield debt - and that part of the credit market is seizing up right now in the COVID-driven race for liquidity https://t.co/HzFo9rtS4o,2020-04-03 14:23:34,Twitter Web App,3,4,covid; 
7/ Let's now rise up to look at the larger economy.  In the wake of COVID we are working hard to help American families boosting their cash flows (small bus loans $1200 checks etc) and reducing their expenses (deferring student loans public housing rent etc),2020-04-03 14:18:02,Twitter Web App,3,6,covid; 
5/ Now add COVID.  Further demand reduction as people stay home businesses temporarily shut down and reduce utility load.  All lead to further reductions in demand and price falls further as would be expected.  https://t.co/0gpsGA2VFg,2020-04-03 14:14:11,Twitter Web App,4,4,covid; 
1/ First note that before COVID really hit the US slower demand and US/Saudi/Russian issues were driving the price down (and I discussed this with the Wells Fargo CEO as a potential debt risk): https://t.co/JRn6un6Y5Q,2020-04-03 14:04:13,Twitter Web App,5,14,covid; 
We need to talk about oil markets and COVID.  Several dynamics are at play that are good for your wallet and good for the environment but are being opposed by oil majors and potentially supported by an economically illiterate White House.  Thread:,2020-04-03 13:59:53,Twitter Web App,38,114,covid;

Re Trump's talk about what we'll do in 15 days.  Ignore it. He's bad at math &amp; doesn't understand geometric compounding. 15 days ago US had ~200 COVID cases.  Today we're over 52000.

There are so many lessons we are learning through this COVID-19 crisis about what matters.  Who is important.  Who we depend on. Most are inspirational - but take a moment to listen in this moment and learn. Thread of interesting things I've heard over the last few days:,2020-03-25 00:54:35,Twitter Web App,19,109,covid; 
The legislative problem with the McConnell #COVID19 bill is that most people fundamentally don't trust Donald Trump to act in the best interests of the US and refuse to write him a blank check.     The problem for the country is that the @GOP still does. https://t.co/1qj8FkfpJw,2020-03-23 12:57:52,Twitter Web App,44,209,covid; 
Be strong Ben!    And everyone else keep in mind that Ben is young (45) healthy and not in the high risk population for COVID-19.  This can hit all of us.  Stay safe. https://t.co/77onp39Ny1,2020-03-23 12:15:47,Twitter for iPad,18,104,covid; 
12/ Yesterday we had ~24000 confirmed COVID-19 cases.  On March 19 we had 12000.  March 17: 5600.  March 18: 2800.  Doubling every other day.  That is what viral transmission looks like.  If we don't immediately lock ourselves down we will have 1 million cases by April 1.,2020-03-22 18:49:01,Twitter Web App,9,29,covid; 
9/ And keep in mind: the geometric math of COVID-19 spread is a lot like the geometric math of social media.  There's a reason we call posts that blow up "viral".,2020-03-22 18:43:49,Twitter Web App,5,20,covid; 
He’s telling people that drugs that have nothing to do with COVID-19 might cure them.  This is clinical malpractice.  https://t.co/PSZZIsssyV https://t.co/QVE00LUFqf,2020-03-20 01:43:39,Twitter for iPad,18,96,covid; 
6/ Moving to testing: COVID-19 is spreading faster than our ability to test is ramping up.  That's the result of a lot of botched decisions several months ago but at this point it is what it is.  PH officials have no choice but to prioritize mitigation over testing.,2020-03-13 16:58:50,Twitter Web App,1,13,covid; 
4/ Given the demographics of COVID-19 eldercare facilities are a greater concern than schools.  And if children stay home that can be disruptive and create other public health problems especially if parents have to change their schedule.,2020-03-13 16:55:46,Twitter Web App,0,13,covid;

Kathleen: Until the WH gets their act together on testing we are going to have more cases than we know.  If you have flu-like symptoms assume you have COVID-19 and take appropriate precautions.

This is frightening but I encourage all to read.  From a friend / public health professional.  We can and must do much more than we are doing to control coronavirus.

15/ If you are immuno-compromised for any reason and you have the ability to do so it's not a bad idea to secure more of your prescription meds than usual so that if you need to self-quarantine from COVID-19 you have all the other protection you need.,2020-02-29 14:49:18,Twitter Web App,13,31,covid; 
12/ So what to do if you feel sick?  Go to your doctor get tested for COVID-19.  Take comfort in the fact that all but one of the confirmed US cases were caught by local public health officials (vs ramped up border screening).  That's where the expertise is.,2020-02-29 14:40:32,Twitter Web App,14,33,covid; 
8/ The coronavirus is a "zoonotic" virus meaning it is transmitted from animals to humans.

5/ The good news/bad news about the virus is that it is significantly less fatal than other recent threats (SARS Ebola)  Only ~20% of the people who contract COVID-19  develop severe symptoms  For the balance this feels like a bad cold (fever cough etc),2020-02-29 14:27:44,Twitter Web App,18,44,covid;
