🚨 I've been endorsed by the @NFIB!   As our nation recovers from COVID-19 I will continue standing w/ President @realDonaldTrump to deliver his America-first agenda that will support Kansas business owners &amp; ensure we rebuild our economy stronger than ever before. #ks02 #ksleg https://t.co/8FAjFrc6RF,2020-06-24 18:07:05,TweetDeck,6,11,covid;
