NY has always been hostile to small businesses and COVID-19 has worsened that burden.   Its time to eliminate burdensome policies that hold them back and pass policies that will unleash the power of New York’s private sector - thats what I'm fighting for https://t.co/0bX8aG94q8,2020-09-26 02:02:41,Twitter for iPhone,3,19,covid;

Cuomo is lying to us again. He’s refusing to tell us how many New Yorkers died as a result of his order forcing COVID positive patients into nursing homes. Now he's having his Health Commissioner do his dirty work. Even Democrats aren't buying these lies https://t.co/6dkB6ysi7m,2020-08-06 02:40:10,Twitter for iPhone,8,32,covid; 
Great to tour NOYES Hospital in Dansville yesterday. As we weather the COVID-19 crisis it's crucial we ensure our rural hospitals have the resources needed to deliver quality care.
