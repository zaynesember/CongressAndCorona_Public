We see the same attitude &amp; selfish response to COVID-19. We must send Trump a clear message in November - we want a president w a plan to control the virus &amp; who values the lives of Americans. #Gaslighter,2020-09-22 22:40:04,Twitter for iPhone,0,1,covid; 
7mos later &amp; Trump is still no closer to executing an overarching plan to combat the coronavirus pandemic.

Ivanka Trump spent the afternoon in my district papering over the suffering Donald Trump has caused Floridians because he lied to the American people &amp; then failed to act when we needed decisive leadership.

From #COVID19 to racial injustice to the #climatecrisis - the common thread is a president who refuses to listen lead &amp; unite our nation.

Trump's plan to defund Social Security &amp; Medicare will harm disabled &amp; older neighbors. #Florida is already suffering Trump's incoherent #COVID19 response.
