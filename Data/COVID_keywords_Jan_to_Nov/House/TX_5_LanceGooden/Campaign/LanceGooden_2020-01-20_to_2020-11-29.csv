The media call @SpeakerPelosi a "master negotiator" but what has she done with her majority?  ❌ Led DEMs into a losing impeachment hoax ❌ Blundered a deal for COVID economic relief ❌ Caved to radical 'squad' on defunding law enforcement,2020-10-07 16:06:55,Twitter Web App,29,48,covid; 
The #CCP destroyed evidence and hid crucial data about Coronavirus while limiting exports of key PPE supplies.  The WHO parroted their propaganda.    We must continue to uncover China's culpability in the global pandemic. https://t.co/RUtb7td9Eg,2020-09-21 15:36:27,Twitter Web App,738,710,corona; 
My thoughts on the latest COVID relief negotiations: It may be time for us to walk away from this deal.  Republicans are not united in this belief that we need to spend trillions more dollars at this point especially if if involves concessions to Nancy Pelosi. https://t.co/hTezzrSgj3,2020-08-06 16:30:05,Twitter Media Studio,12,42,covid; 
Over 150K Americans are dead and millions of livelihoods ruined due to the negligence of the #CCP.  @RepJimBanks and I introduced the Civil Justice for Victims of COVID Act to allow Americans to hold China accountable.
