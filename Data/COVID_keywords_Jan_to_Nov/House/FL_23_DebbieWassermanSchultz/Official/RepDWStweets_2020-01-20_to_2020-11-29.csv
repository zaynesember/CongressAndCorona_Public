Even in female-dominated professions – many of them on the COVID-19 front lines – it is nurses psychiatric and home health aides and grocery store cashiers who feel this gap. (4/8),2020-03-31 14:12:49,Twitter Web App,0,1,covid;

Masks. Face shields. Ventilators. These are the tools our hospitals need to take on the #coronavirus. @HouseDemocrats secured resources in the #CARESAct to help them access all that and more.  https://t.co/fFAPdBknuw,2020-03-28 20:33:30,Twitter for iPhone,2,5,corona;

.@GovRonDeSantis is afraid to lead. Issuing a #StayHome order is surest way to stop spread of #coronavirus before critically ill Floridians overwhelm our hospitals but he refuses.  https://t.co/Ahf90cLKNk,2020-03-24 16:21:51,Twitter Web App,4,4,corona; 
In the cascade of #coronavirus news it's easy to miss important updates. The IRS extended its filing deadline to July 15 giving everyone 3 additional months to file their federal taxes. https://t.co/6uJwLO1ZHj,2020-03-22 18:56:50,Twitter for iPhone,8,9,corona;

These past days have required a massive local and national response to #Coronavirus. Here is a brief rundown of what I am doing to help address it in Washington and South Florida. https://t.co/Hrg4Zs7ArL,2020-03-19 15:17:53,Twitter Ads,5,5,corona; 
Thank you to all of the nurses doctors and health care workers in #FL23 who continue to selflessly go in and fight the spread of #Coronavirus. You are the heroes we need in this time of crisis. https://t.co/08UFB0B6D3,2020-03-18 16:01:29,Twitter for iPhone,1,2,corona; 
Some polling places across South Florida have moved in response to the #Coronavirus. You still have time to vote before the polls close but be sure to check if your precinct location has changed. https://t.co/rczWwNUho8,2020-03-17 19:11:31,Twitter Web App,101,113,corona; 
Just last week I heard troubling testimony from NIAID Dir. Dr. Fauci that the US  is “failing” to adequately test for #Coronavirus.   This is taking too long.   HT to @AlexWagner &amp; @SHO_TheCircus for documenting it. https://t.co/xXXoSyQePK,2020-03-16 17:07:35,TweetDeck,4,1,corona; 
I'm proud to have joined with @HouseDemocrats to deliver the #FamiliesFirst #Coronavirus Response Act.  Americans need a coordinated fully-funded government-wide response to keep us safe from this pandemic https://t.co/jZwUJwJtBT,2020-03-15 18:15:18,Twitter Web App,3,3,corona; 
As the social and economic impacts of #COVID19 mount @HouseDemocrats worked through the night on the #FamiliesFirst #Coronavirus Response Act. I’m proud to have voted to (among other things) ✅Guarantee free testing ✅Establish paid sick leave ✅Expand food assistance,2020-03-14 14:03:28,Twitter for iPhone,28,113,covid; corona; 
The US distressingly lags globally in #Coronavirus testing at just a fraction of what S. Korea UK Italy &amp; Israel have done.  We need free fast widely available testing to understand and contain #COVID19US.   This administrations keeps failing to lead. https://t.co/ojpZqsMpks,2020-03-13 16:09:28,TweetDeck,7,5,covid; corona; 
I asked Dr. Fauci @OversightDems about #Coronavirus testing. He said our #COVID19 system is ‘failing.’ This is unacceptable. It’s past time for free testing for everyone who needs it including the uninsured. https://t.co/Rp7xOAVL81,2020-03-12 18:16:07,Twitter Web App,15,15,covid; corona; 
In this #Coronavirus epidemic our 1st responders are more likely to be exposed in the line of duty. I met w/ @WalterIAFF  our District VP of the IAFF alongside firefighters from Miami-Dade to discuss how the federal gov't can help keep 1st responders safe as they keep us safe. https://t.co/utNmcVV8Tr,2020-03-11 13:04:16,Twitter Web App,2,2,corona; 
#Coronavirus makes the case for paid sick leave all the more apparent. Every day we have symptomatic people going to work and spreading disease because they can’t afford not to.  https://t.co/ffRlYdP3Wh,2020-03-10 14:08:15,Twitter Web App,2,4,corona; 
If you are concerned about Coronavirus symptoms:  1. Call the Florida Department of Health in Broward County @FLHealthBroward (866-779-6121)   2. Call your health care provider,2020-03-09 16:05:13,Twitter Web App,2,3,corona; 
This morning @RepTedDeutch and I held a round table with local leaders and health professionals to address the spread of #Coronavirus in Florida. It is critical that we work together to contain and mitigate the disease and present a unified whole-of-government response. https://t.co/F8aYTDG2kv,2020-03-09 16:05:12,Twitter Web App,8,19,corona; 
The $8.3 billion emergency response package passed by @HouseDemocrats will go a long way to address the #Coronavirus epidemic but the single biggest thing we can all do is practice good hygiene and wash your hands regularly. https://t.co/zmVt8V8yye,2020-03-05 22:12:16,Twitter Web App,2,3,corona;
