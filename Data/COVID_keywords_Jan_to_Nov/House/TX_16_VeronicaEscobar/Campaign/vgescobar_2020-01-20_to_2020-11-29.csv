I'll continue to push for more federal funding for El Paso. But we need a willing Senate.   Pls reach out to senators who could help force @senatemajldr to bring our COVID bills to the floor which would help small businesses unemployed food banks schools hospitals and govts. https://t.co/OsAMCRbEFY,2020-11-12 23:15:05,Twitter Web App,8,40,covid; 
People in Texas are dying because of COVID and THIS is his priority?  @DanPatrick how about sending that $1 million to the El Paso food banks? https://t.co/uVUTLgZeCQ,2020-11-11 04:09:08,Twitter for iPhone,180,591,covid; 
We have TEN mobile morgues.  El Paso is in a COVID state of emergency   Three council members (@district3elpaso @EpDistrict1 @CityRepAnnello) speak out for transparency + urgency &amp; there’s an effort to silence them.  Pls Council - focus on the emergency. https://t.co/Z1h010hJXx,2020-11-10 02:15:41,Twitter for iPhone,14,52,covid; 
Ten mobile morgues!  The El Paso COVID crisis is getting exponentially worse.  Meanwhile @KenPaxtonTX is doing everything possible to prevent the county judge from taking urgent action.  And @GregAbbott_TX could end the legal battle by simply untying the hands of local leaders. https://t.co/7zua1hZcpm,2020-11-09 04:08:19,Twitter for iPhone,158,302,covid; 
El Paso is in a COVID state of emergency and three Council members have consistently demanded transparency &amp; urgent action: @cassbrown10811 @CityRepAnnello and @PeterSvarzbein  They’ve used their 1st amendment rights to try to keep us safe.  And now this👇🏽 https://t.co/H3GRmrtTTx,2020-11-06 23:39:57,Twitter for iPhone,28,95,covid; 
Although we didn't turn Texas blue I am so proud of you El Paso. In the midst of a COVID emergency El Paso turnout exceeded expectations and we delivered more votes for Joe Biden than any other Texas border county. That didn't happen on its own. https://t.co/6LNb0BgQMO,2020-11-04 22:47:17,Twitter Web App,20,220,covid; 
Want to better understand why El Paso has become a national COVID hotspot? https://t.co/ZKSdnKTYn3,2020-11-01 14:52:59,Twitter for iPhone,19,56,covid; 
I am so proud of our El Paso!   Despite our COVID state of emergency voters have turned out in record numbers to ensure their voices are heard.   The most heartbreaking calls I’ve made have been with folks suffering from Covid afraid they won’t be well in time to vote on Tues. https://t.co/fnC9ZARE92,2020-10-31 14:39:27,Twitter for iPhone,12,73,covid; 
Unless @IvankaTrump that life is...  one of the 1000s of children separated from their parents at the border  one of the 10s of 1000s of black lives killed by law enforcement  one of 200000+ people dead of COVID  one of millions of Americans w/ pre-existing conditions https://t.co/K7JlO7aKKU,2020-10-31 01:01:15,Twitter Web App,16,78,covid; 
El Paso!!! Two things:  1. Please take care of yourselves and each other during the COVID state of emergency we're in.  2. TODAY is the last day of early voting.  Go vote then go home. Over 30 locations closing at different times.   Check for deets 👇🏾  https://t.co/3SYX7y1687,2020-10-30 20:41:28,Twitter Web App,14,59,covid; 
When he testified before the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Dr. Peter Hotez said a generation of Latinos are being “decimated” by COVID-19.  Decimated.  @mayor_margo should insist that @GregAbbott_TX &amp; @KenPaxtonTX protect our community and allow @EPCountyJudge’s order to stand. https://t.co/nNCLr6mfRo,2020-10-30 03:07:50,Twitter for iPhone,160,519,covid; 
COVID has taken some of El Paso’s great warriors.  Heartbroken again tonight.  El Paso please please — make the sacrifices we need to make to protect one another.  And please stay safe.,2020-10-28 03:28:54,Twitter for iPhone,41,244,covid; 
Latino@s are getting sicker and dying at higher rates than our white neighbors.  Telling the nation the coronavirus is going to “go away” is irresponsible dangerous and deadly.  Vote. Him. Out.  #PresidentialDebate2020,2020-10-23 01:25:35,Twitter for iPhone,72,237,corona; 
THIS is why we can’t get a COVID relief bill.  They have no clue about Americans’ struggles.  @realDonaldTrump &amp; his enablers are profoundly out of touch w/ most Americans who can’t be airlifted to a hospital can’t get immediate care can’t afford to miss work.  Vote. Them. Out. https://t.co/bIyw9Oi7M2,2020-10-06 03:13:31,Twitter for iPhone,26,103,covid; 
This man is literally killing us.  From the hate-fueled violence @realDonaldTrump inspires in his supporters resulting in the loss of innocent life to his COVID mismanagement and incompetence that has taken over 180000 Americans.  Trump’s America is a dangerous and tragic place. https://t.co/pgURul213b,2020-08-30 15:30:18,Twitter for iPhone,19,61,covid; 
Guess he missed those beautiful powerful prayers during our uplifting convention.  This from a man who overlooks the Godlessness of @realDonaldTrump -- a predator grifter a man with no regard for the vulnerable who puts children in cages and watches Americans die from COVID👌🏾 https://t.co/WGnes8iwMa,2020-08-21 15:19:32,Twitter Web App,7,36,covid; 
You should be ashamed of finding this amusing. Unfortunately it’s not surprising. You found COVID-19 amusing too. https://t.co/rUnZRRPoaZ,2020-08-18 13:22:13,Twitter for iPhone,17,59,covid; 
The first night of the #DemConvention was inspiring!  From the tribute to Americans who lost their lives to COVID to @MichelleObama’s powerful speech to @BetoORourke’s honesty and sincerity to #theboss Bruce Springsteen...I feel uplifted and fired up!  #JoeBiden #2020Election https://t.co/Pd5CrfYep4,2020-08-18 03:12:45,Twitter for iPhone,23,106,covid; 
We know that Latinos are most at risk of getting sick and dying of COVID.  We also know our kids are 8 times more likely to be hospitalized.  The lack of reliable information (and transparency) in our community is indeed dangerous. And it’s outrageous. https://t.co/rXPwi6QKad,2020-08-15 15:17:16,Twitter for iPhone,39,98,covid; 
Putting children in cages is abhorrent.  Preventing migrants from seeking asylum is unlawful.  Fueling Covid in ICE Facilities is inhumane.  Invading American cities w/o the authority to do so is un-American.  @DHS_Wolf shouldn’t have a position of authority. Not now. Not ever. https://t.co/FL7VpAZI1k,2020-07-21 02:42:26,Twitter for iPhone,91,260,covid; 
“The era of procrastination of half measures of soothing and baffling expedients of delays is coming to a close. In its place we are entering a period of consequences.” - Winston Churchill  Texas is becoming COVID Ground Zero while @GovAbbott chooses fecklessness &amp; pandering. https://t.co/6pqH2fCiMG,2020-07-03 18:15:15,Twitter for iPhone,8,27,covid; 
.@DanPatrick is dangerous reckless and irresponsible.  This is the man whose COVID strategy is to let our elderly Texans get sick and die for the sake of the Texas economy. https://t.co/DXp0o89dgn,2020-07-01 14:37:10,Twitter for iPhone,28,71,covid; 
FACT: the largest most frequent protests were in D.C. not Texas where COVID is spiraling out of control.  We'd know a whole lot more about the spread and we could've contained it more effectively if we any had leadership from @realDonaldTrump or @GovAbbott.  But we don't. https://t.co/kWGCBHaTUU,2020-06-29 13:54:05,Twitter Web App,113,360,covid; 
The @GovAbbott COVID-19 strategy for Texas?  Very Trumpian.  1. Don’t lead 2. Don’t accept responsibility  3. Blame others https://t.co/5GkgI9l0Iy,2020-06-16 03:03:43,Twitter for iPhone,133,312,covid; 
First we learned that El Paso’s testing numbers include re-tests skewing the percentage of our population being tested.  Now we learn that not only do we lead big TX counties in the COVID death rate but not all deaths in the county are being counted. https://t.co/unbVCREfRx,2020-06-15 04:01:19,Twitter for iPhone,67,87,covid; 
@jacobsoboroff Unfortunately we don’t know the real number of COVID-19 cases/deaths in Mexico. Mexico’s public testing policy is terrible - only testing those admitted to a hospital.  Trump and AMLO should’ve worked together on a joint testing/tracing policy esp in border communities.,2020-06-07 14:25:57,Twitter for iPhone,13,53,covid; 
As a reminder to everyone who was unable to socially distance during the marches mourning George Floyd’s murder (and so many other deaths) protesting police brutality &amp; racism please know COVID testing is free and available. Wait 5-7 days (not 48 hours as I’d previously posted) https://t.co/BvrvyLY0Hz,2020-06-03 15:55:08,Twitter for iPhone,14,38,covid; 
Tonight as members of our beautiful community come together to mourn the needless &amp; tragic death of #GeorgeFloyd as well as raise awareness of the pain caused by systemic racism pls look out for one another socially distance (our COVID-19 #s are climbing) and stay safe.🙏🏾 https://t.co/1dsDPcW3Zp,2020-05-31 23:23:59,Twitter Web App,13,44,covid; 
Maybe the Senator can help us convince ⁦@GovAbbott⁩ to expand the ACA in TX!  “⁦@JohnCornyn⁩ on Tuesday encouraged Americans who have lost health care coverage during the coronavirus pandemic due to losing their jobs to sign up for ObamaCare.” https://t.co/oLRlwDdzYz,2020-05-13 21:35:30,Twitter for iPhone,11,25,corona;

I’m so broken hearted for @ewarren who lost her brother to the Coronavirus and to @RepMaxineWaters whose sister is seriously ill as well.  Americans across the country are suffering the tragic loss of loved ones which is why must continue to protect and take care of one another.,2020-04-23 18:10:21,Twitter for iPhone,8,54,corona; 
If the self-congratulatory media-bashing Trump-praising parts of these Coronavirus Task Force briefings were eliminated and the focus would strictly be on new information they’d save everyone a whole lot of time.,2020-03-21 18:09:35,Twitter for iPhone,30,140,corona; 
They kept the truth from the American people and used the information instead to protect their bank accounts and themselves.  These are not public servants.  And P.S. @SenRonJohnson voted against the #FamiliesFirst Coronavirus relief bill. https://t.co/hmFzbSQ1Xr,2020-03-20 02:53:13,Twitter for iPhone,30,83,corona;
