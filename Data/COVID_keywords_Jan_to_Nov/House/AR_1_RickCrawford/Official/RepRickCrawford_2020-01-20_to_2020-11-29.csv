Reports of a second successful vaccine for COVID shows yet again that Operation Warp Speed is a resounding success.

The MSM enabled President Trump’s opponents to continually claim he was doing nothing about COVID. They also relentlessly scoffed at his insistence that a vaccine was imminent.

While more #COVIDー19 cases are in AR I want to encourage *all of us* to check in with those who are over 60. These are some of the most vulnerable along with immunosuppressed. Getting out could become hard. Food supplies may be hard for them to get. Lets help if we can!,2020-03-12 21:14:37,Twitter Web App,3,17,covid;

The American worker through all their effort and expertise is what makes our economy strong and resilient.   Let’s find ways to support those who go to work every day and those who employ them. Let’s find solutions to keep things going not for closing them down. #COVIDー19 https://t.co/JsATQR9LkY,2020-03-12 16:49:00,Twitter for iPhone,3,6,covid; 
Another great #COVID19 resource for folks in Arkansas and the First District. @StBernards has an online resource for screening of the virus. Please take some time to read and know what is there to help you or others: https://t.co/kje1Uvn0Mu,2020-03-12 14:13:49,Twitter for iPhone,10,19,covid; 
Everyone in America can play a part uniting our country in our fight against #COVIDー19. The President outlined steps we all need to take in order for America to persevere. I fully support his plan and decisions. Let’s unite America and overcome this crisis!,2020-03-12 01:20:03,Twitter for iPhone,8,36,covid; 
The team at @uamshealth in Little Rock have developed a FREE tool - *to those who live in Arkansas* - to evaluate whether or not you potentially have #COVID19. It can be accessed via your smartphone tablet or personal computer. More information 👇 (1/2)  https://t.co/2HKvO2JUjo,2020-03-11 19:20:27,Twitter Web App,14,24,covid;

There’s a big shortage of hand sanitizer right now and one of the top ingredients is #ethanol. How can we convert our supplies to reduce the shortage? I bet American companies and innovators can find a way. Let’s make it happen!  American agriculture can help #COVID19 globally!,2020-03-11 13:51:11,Twitter for iPhone,6,25,covid; 
American #agriculture can play a role in helping front line workers in the #COVID19 outbreak. How? #Cotton is a big component of the masks that are in short supply. I have a 100k+ square foot facility in AR1 ready to make the masks. We’re open for business!,2020-03-11 12:39:59,Twitter for iPhone,7,31,covid; 
.@SenTomCotton is exactly right about getting a bill to the floor *this week* to ensure masks for front line caregivers are made available. These masks are appropriate for respiratory matters like #COVIDー19. We can get these here and not wait on China.  https://t.co/ijCOJOGq8L,2020-03-10 14:02:48,Twitter Web App,4,9,covid; 
I appreciate what @ARSenMissyIrvin State Rep. Jack Ladyman and others across AR are doing to prepare for any potential #COVIDー19 cases. The measures being taken for seniors in assisted living facilities is critical as they are most vulnerable. (1/2),2020-03-10 13:47:03,Twitter Web App,4,11,covid; 
The American economy is centered around entrepreneurs small business owners factory workers and everyone in between. #COVIDー19 has blindsided the world but our innovation intellect and agility will ensure we will prevail. Let’s all work together to this end! #America,2020-03-09 22:59:45,Twitter for iPhone,6,31,covid; 
The ability to vote remotely if needed is long overdue. It's time for Congress to join the modern day century. #COVID2019 https://t.co/hk48nkeUns,2020-03-09 21:55:27,Twitter Web App,5,19,covid; 
.@kdamp not only that because of the partnership with @NYITCOMAR we have a healthcare fellow in my DC office helping with the many aspects of the Coronavirus matters. She has been critical to help get info to AR1 hospitals/caregivers. https://t.co/ieMINLnxk3,2020-03-08 14:09:44,Twitter for iPhone,7,21,corona; 
On Monday I visited with many AR-1 hospital admin’s and staff about the #COVIDー19 virus we are seeing across the country. Today I supported a critical emergency aid package that will ensure they have some important tools if we have any cases. Please follow @CDCgov for updates!,2020-03-05 02:17:13,Twitter for iPhone,2,15,covid; 
Agreed 👇🏼 Be sure to follow @CDCgov guidelines on precautions on this and for better health. Washing hands with soap for :20 staying home if you are sick. #CoronaVirusUpdate https://t.co/5pKMdJVn4A,2020-03-01 13:35:27,Twitter for iPhone,167,602,corona; 
Education is critical to halting #coronavirus. @CDCgov  rec's avoiding close contact with those who may be sick &amp; touching your eyes nose &amp; mouth. Also wash your hands often at least :20secs clean &amp; disinfect surfaces &amp; objects people tend to touch. If sick stay home! (3/x),2020-02-28 18:32:29,Twitter Web App,0,3,corona; 
I appreciate the president and vice president taking a hard look at the extraordinary step of invoking the Defense Production Act to insure we have an adequate supply of protective masks for healthcare workers on the #coronavirus frontlines (1/x),2020-02-28 18:32:29,Twitter Web App,5,10,corona; 
.@HawleyMO is absolutely correct when he says we need to secure our medical supply chain. I fully support his effort to ensure we rely less on China for many of the ingredients and drugs made in China we use on a daily basis. #CoronaVirusUpdates https://t.co/CAu80fMOJB,2020-02-28 16:25:14,Twitter for iPhone,890,965,corona; 
It’s absolutely useless to make the #coronavirus situation political. At a time when we as elected officials need to find ways to support those on the front lines - caregivers EMT’s physicians - and not cheap political rhetoric. https://t.co/Dki3Nq6vle,2020-02-28 16:05:22,Twitter for iPhone,5,10,corona; 
The President is taking the necessary steps to ensure our country is ready for any potential spread of the #coronavirus. @VP Pence is well positioned to lead our response and the political attacks that are common must stop so we can all focus on protecting our country.,2020-02-27 02:54:57,Twitter for iPhone,11,50,corona; 
.@SenTomCotton getting accused of spreading “conspiracy theories” by the Fake News Media about the #coronavirus makes you think they believe all of the manipulated economic data China releases. Nothing they report is accurate or truthful. That’s what a communist regime does. https://t.co/fZXuWYgBOo,2020-02-19 02:44:35,Twitter for iPhone,16,35,corona; 
Insisting that Senators call witnesses and secure more documents highlights the size and scope of the House Manager’s #Shampeachment effort. They’ve kept evidence away from the public in the basement of the Capitol. Meanwhile fentanyl is about to be legal and #coronavirus rages,2020-01-31 18:57:24,Twitter for iPhone,7,38,corona; 
Nothing new when it comes to Schiff. It’s time to acquit and address issues like fentanyl and the coronavirus. #Acquit https://t.co/YBNyVnB0pc,2020-01-29 19:29:41,Twitter for iPhone,16,35,corona; 
This demonstrates how House Democrats either rushed their “case of impeachment” or worse they withheld information to bring it out later as the below story demonstrates. It’s time to acquit the President and work on serious issues like fentanyl and the coronavirus. https://t.co/awWYVxaZZs,2020-01-29 19:19:37,Twitter for iPhone,18,39,corona;
