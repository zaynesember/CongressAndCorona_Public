Donald Trump's failure to lead a strong response allowed this disease to spread nearly unchecked. His negligence allowed it to worsen again.   Is Trump doing anything at all about this? Does the Coronavirus Task Force even exist anymore?  Trump's incompetence is killing people. https://t.co/UxLPtVCPfZ,2020-06-24 14:07:10,Twitter Web App,27,78,corona; 
Trump says "we did a great job" -- past tense  He is clueless failing and doing nothing about COVID-19 as cases spike in the United States RIGHT NOW https://t.co/JVlUif62AG https://t.co/Rgh8U70SwC https://t.co/V5jBP1mlNt,2020-06-23 14:57:43,Twitter Web App,19,60,covid; 
Trump is spending more time blaming others for his own failure than on the COVID-19 response https://t.co/4YWRfPYzQP,2020-06-23 14:13:07,Twitter Web App,41,97,covid; 
1) The US-Mexico border is 1954 miles long.  2) Trump is lying again.  3) Trump promised Mexico would pay for his racist symbol and that was a lie too.  4) Arizona is in the middle of the catastrophic COVID-19 spike and Trump either has no idea or doesn’t care. https://t.co/O3HQnliqFD,2020-06-22 23:24:49,Twitter for iPhone,29,82,covid; 
Call it what you will the United States reported more new COVID-19 cases Friday than on any day since May 1 then reported even more Saturday.  This is happening.  Wishful thinking and semantics will not solve this problem. We need better stronger leadership. https://t.co/n6Pv7nqvrs,2020-06-22 13:53:00,Twitter Web App,22,85,covid; 
Glad to see huge numbers of empty seats in Tulsa tonight.  The President put a lot of people at risk by ignoring medical advice about ways to prevent the spread of COVID-19 at this indoor event. https://t.co/DlXKJxeUur,2020-06-21 01:23:10,Twitter for iPhone,45,226,covid; 
Trump says he ordered staff to “slow the testing down” for coronavirus.  120000 Americans have died from COVID-19. https://t.co/lvkDJABZmc,2020-06-21 01:05:09,Twitter for iPhone,106,201,covid; corona; 
Just published: joint OpEd with @RepAGonzalez on our bipartisan legislation to boost COVID-19 testing innovation with a prize competition developed after conversations with economist @paulmromer who helped us pen this. Worth a minute of your time! https://t.co/Rm6bJeW0V7,2020-06-16 18:45:00,TweetDeck,10,24,covid; 
At the time Mulvaney gave these comments he had already been tested for COVID-19 secretly.  Tests were very very hard to get in late February and early March and basically impossible for people without symptoms even after exposure (myself included). https://t.co/jCXxuDaeWe,2020-06-16 18:18:39,Twitter Web App,73,162,covid; 
In late February then acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney gave public comments playing down the seriousness of coronavirus and mocking the press for covering it.  We now know (thanks to @lachlan) that Mulvaney dumped his stocks days later: https://t.co/SS3YLeWcZn https://t.co/sBEQvwUemZ,2020-06-16 18:15:52,Twitter Web App,1003,1646,corona;
