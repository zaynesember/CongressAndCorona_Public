Trump is incapable of running this country.    Look @JoeBiden has a plan to contain Covid-19 and to build our country back better.

Pres. Trump lied to the American people about coronavirus and how deadly it is. He didn't have a plan.  Now 200000 Americans paid with their lives and nearly 30 million are unemployed.  Trump needs to answer for those failures tonight.,2020-09-30 01:29:17,Hootsuite Inc.,14,92,corona;

In July 31 million Americans received federal unemployment aid.  Coronavirus is not going away anytime soon. It is clear that reopening state economies is not the solution. Congress must pass a bill to extend federal unemployment benefits. https://t.co/dgXovPhXi7,2020-08-11 12:05:03,Hootsuite Inc.,5,3,corona;

We need more coronavirus tests.   To get people back to work we need 25 million tests per day.  How do we do that?  Offer incentives to research labs to create fast accurate tests.
