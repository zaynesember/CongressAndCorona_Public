With the US death toll from COVID surpassing 173000 Trump has failed our country. Tonight @MikeBloomberg reinforced the message of this critical moment the call for true leadership and why @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris will get us through this. #DemConvention #FlaPol,2020-08-21 02:27:13,Twitter for iPhone,8,20,covid; 
I agree with @nikkifried! Please support @HattersleyforFL. He'll join me in Congress in supporting women tackling climate change and helping families through this COVID crisis. He is the strongest Dem to win in November! PLEASE VOTE! #FlaPol #FL15 https://t.co/nGD43pTFKI,2020-08-18 15:15:26,TweetDeck,4,13,covid; 
My Op-Ed on CNN on how Congress is facing the ultimate test of leadership during this #COVID19 crisis. We must work better together in order to get “swift simple and sufficient” aid to the American people. #FL07 #FlaPol  https://t.co/H9lyCx2jnW,2020-04-11 14:08:10,Twitter for iPhone,2,3,covid;

Proud to stand with my @HouseBlueDogs colleagues in demanding that Congress produce a balanced economic rescue package that focuses on the middle class. Both parties must balance lessons of the past with the realities we face today. https://t.co/TJft00aV4d #FL07 #FlaPol #COVID19,2020-03-23 19:26:05,TweetDeck,2,12,covid; 
“Due to the rapidly accelerating spread of coronavirus it is essential that Florida’s governor use his power to immediately close access to all public beaches in the state of Florida...if we want to successfully slow the spread of the virus.” #FL07 #FlaPol #COVID19 https://t.co/vRhrEgmVSR,2020-03-20 23:50:36,TweetDeck,4,17,covid; corona; 
While there are very legitimate criticisms of how China has handled coronavirus @POTUS using this xenophobic term to label #COVID19 is unproductive &amp; invites unfair discrimination &amp; harassment toward Asian Americans. We’re all in this together &amp; we must unite to stop the spread. https://t.co/vlmM8lvPaY,2020-03-18 00:55:50,Twitter for iPhone,4,20,covid; corona;
