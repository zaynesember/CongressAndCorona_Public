As our local leaders have explained the lack of testing means that the number of confirmed cases doesn’t reflect the reality our health care workers see as they work around-the-clock to treat those affected by #COVID19.  https://t.co/qq9lbAzcXT,2020-04-05 19:07:18,Gain Platform,14,33,covid; 
This is unacceptable. I’m already hearing from constituents who are having trouble applying for SBA relief.  Congress made it a priority to provide relief for small businesses negatively impacted by #COVID19 in the CARES Act. The SBA must address this. https://t.co/Kqt13DyZ54,2020-04-04 19:24:15,Gain Platform,53,75,covid; 
A thousand #COVID19 tests per day for one of the largest cities in the country simply is not enough. Today along with @RepSylviaGarcia and @RepAlGreen I called on FEMA and HHS to increase the amount available here. https://t.co/tV9Ntvta05,2020-04-03 21:24:19,Gain Platform,20,44,covid; 
In this moment of crisis there should be no delays in providing our health care workers and their patients with the tools needed to fight #COVID19.
