This year I switched up my normal routine and voted early. It was great—no long lines and lots of room to maintain social distance.  It has been amazing to see how well @HarrisVotes and #TX07 have turned out the vote but we're not done yet.  Get out there and #VoteEarly! https://t.co/t50dqOkATE,2020-10-21 00:45:00,Twitter Media Studio,26,118,social distance; 
Right now the last thing #TX07 families should have to worry about is affording the health care they need—whether for COVID-19 or for their pre-existing conditions.  I've been working in Congress to protect coverage—because it's never been more important. https://t.co/TCEcrPVznU,2020-09-03 12:04:33,Twitter Media Studio,51,86,covid; 
While you're working here in Houston I'm working in Washington to support our economy in these difficult times.

Small businesses in #TX07 have weathered so much in recent years—hurricanes floods and now COVID-19. Many paying back CARES Act loans are still paying back disaster loans too.  I'm glad to lead a bipartisan coalition to help them in the LIFT UP Act covered on @FOX26Houston: https://t.co/YVLSJYKxVb,2020-08-06 17:12:23,Gain Platform,8,20,covid;
