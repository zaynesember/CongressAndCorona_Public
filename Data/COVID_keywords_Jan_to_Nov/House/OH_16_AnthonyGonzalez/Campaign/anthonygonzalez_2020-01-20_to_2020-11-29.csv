Reopening schools this fall should be top priority in COVID-19 response: Anthony Gonzalez https://t.co/OyFbDnrRZj,2020-06-12 10:28:15,Twitter for iPhone,9,43,covid; 
China is using the focus on the Covid crisis to renege on yet another critical agreement in hopes the world doesn’t notice. We stand firmly with the people of Hong Kong as the CCP tramples on their rights. https://t.co/WoxhyREzBu,2020-05-27 16:15:13,Twitter for iPhone,5,22,covid; 
Thrilled to see this focus on nursing homes. We know residents at elder care facilities are the most vulnerable to this virus of anyone in the state.   Ohio will test all nursing home staffers and some residents for coronavirus Gov. Mike DeWine says https://t.co/GvMybWOTUP,2020-05-27 11:12:14,Twitter for iPhone,3,25,corona; 
In a country of 23 million people Taiwan has 7 deaths from coronavirus. If there is anyone we should be learning from it’s them.   Their exclusion from the World Health Assembly is unconscionable and another example of CCP control over the ⁦@WHO⁩.   https://t.co/IRF3ido7p6,2020-05-19 01:09:16,Twitter for iPhone,9,41,corona; 
Every role I ever saw Jerry Stiller in he made me laugh. I’ll be celebrating Festivus in his honor this year. Covid-related Airing of Grievances shaping up to be a lengthy one this 2020. https://t.co/aejlgDz6tJ,2020-05-11 23:53:37,Twitter for iPhone,4,82,covid; 
Also dangerous is the fact that @SusanWojcicki announced that the WHO is now the arbiter of truth on @YouTube. The WHO which is clearly compromised by the CCP has as spotty of a record as anyone on Covid news.   We should wait for the US trials before we make a judgement here. https://t.co/lZTfquayBz,2020-04-23 18:06:30,Twitter for iPhone,3,17,covid; 
We acted early and prepared for the worst. The surge never came which is good. But it has left our hospitals crippled financially.   Meanwhile states that didn’t act and let their hospitals get overwhelmed got paid fine for Covid care. Not fair to Ohio.  https://t.co/BuucZXi4mY,2020-04-23 01:08:20,Twitter for iPhone,6,27,covid; 
The one thing that can be a true game changer in getting us back on our feet more quickly is effective treatment options.   Very EARLY data here starting to show some promise.  Gilead data suggests coronavirus patients are responding to treatment https://t.co/2O4Q4XUML0,2020-04-17 01:12:17,Twitter for iPhone,4,14,corona; 
As soon as this is past us we need to:  1. Move critical medical and security supply chains back home.  2. Reform international organizations that legitimize the Chinese Communist Party.  3. Fully investigate CCP’s role in the spread of Covid19 and seek restitution if warranted. https://t.co/ZaqKdwStwN,2020-03-29 22:04:09,Twitter for iPhone,303,505,covid; 
|As soon as we get past this mess we need to demand a full investigation into China’s role in the discovery spread and coverup of the coronavirus.

Great to see my friend and Cuban Mafia ringleader @MarioDB doing better after a tough bout of coronavirus.   Hard to find a more warm-hearted and passionate member of Congress. https://t.co/se6DtGUgDr,2020-03-21 23:08:03,Twitter for iPhone,3,16,corona;

With our first few cases of coronavirus in Cuyahoga here are a few people I follow to provide accurate and useful information.   @ScottGottliebMD @SeemaCMS @CDCgov @JohnsHopkinsSPH @elerianm @onlyyoontv (last 2 are finance-related)  And Dr. Fauci (google him for quotes) https://t.co/wH3dqwENcK,2020-03-10 12:14:22,Twitter for iPhone,20,58,corona;
