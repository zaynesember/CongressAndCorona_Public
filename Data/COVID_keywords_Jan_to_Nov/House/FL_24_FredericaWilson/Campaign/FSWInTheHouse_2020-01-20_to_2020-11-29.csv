Voting should be free fair and safe. Learn your state’s rules about mail-in ballots and key deadlines.  Americans shouldn’t be forced to risk their lives during a #coronavirus pandemic to exercise the precious right to vote. Spread the word (not the virus) and #VoteFromHome! https://t.co/NfoZjkiIun,2020-08-31 20:48:49,Twitter Media Studio,0,0,corona;
