Just like many other parts of the country South Florida is experiencing another surge of COVID-19 cases. A national mask mandate which is what my Masks for All Act calls for could help prevent over 100 thousand deaths in the coming months. https://t.co/BAULeKJzOF,2020-11-16 16:16:00,TweetDeck,36,153,covid; 
COVID-19 cases are once again up across the nation and could continue to surge in the coming winter months. My Masks for All Act would help keep our communities safe and prevent another economic lockdown by implementing a temporary national mask mandate. #MaskUp https://t.co/1Ug0Cvyi4s,2020-11-13 16:30:23,Twitter Web App,13,55,covid;

The only way to beat this virus and restore normalcy is by taking the threat of COVID-19 seriously.

The science is clear: the most effective way to quickly contain #COVID19 is through widespread mask wearing. I’m calling on Congress to pass my Masks For All Act to implement a national mask mandate and ensure that all Americans have access to free or low-cost masks. https://t.co/O5RZrTUi8J,2020-11-09 19:46:00,TweetDeck,13,91,covid; 
An overwhelming majority of Americans support mask mandates. In order to stave off another wave of #COVID19 cases and deaths and another lockdown we must enact a national mask mandate which is what my Masks For All Act would do. https://t.co/9VuqsN6U14,2020-11-09 19:23:00,TweetDeck,20,108,covid; 
Communities across the nation are experiencing a surge of #COVID19 cases.
