It's a disgrace that Mitch McConnell has rushed the process to confirm a new Supreme Court justice while he's stalled COVID relief and left hundreds of bipartisan bills on his desk without action.,2020-10-27 00:40:42,Twitter for iPhone,54,240,covid; 
We must come together to get more support for the American people in response to COVID-19.  That should include making strong investments in our communities education small businesses and workers. I won't be satisfied until we get something over the finish line. #NHpolitics https://t.co/txhWtfhLlr,2020-10-22 17:28:15,TweetDeck,8,16,covid; 
While Mr. Mowers was focused on leveling baseless attacks against me and misrepresenting my record I spoke about specific ways we can help Granite Staters by passing a new COVID-19 relief package protecting affordable health care and bringing our economy back from the brink.,2020-10-22 01:55:14,Twitter for iPhone,8,93,covid; 
We are the midst of a national crisis right now with the COVID-19 pandemic and what is most important is that we have a substantive discussion so that the voters can learn where we stand on the issues.,2020-10-22 01:55:13,Twitter for iPhone,3,59,covid; 
This is the crucial question: how can we bring people together to get a COVID-19 response bill. That must include support for our local businesses help for Granite Staters who are out of work and funding for local cities and towns.   That's what I'm fighting for.  #WMURdebate,2020-10-21 23:28:03,TweetDeck,11,30,covid; 
With COVID-19 surging nationally and some tough months ahead of us our strategy must be based in science and driven by the recommendations of our public health experts.  It’s shameful that the President is again undermining the people who are working to keep us safe. #NHPolitics https://t.co/gxYa0CvJZF,2020-10-19 17:11:39,Twitter for iPhone,4,29,covid; 
It was great to meet with workers students and business leaders in Laconia this week. Glad to have the chance to talk about COVID-19 relief improving our infrastructure and more. #NHPolitics #NH01 https://t.co/t2U2j03FBh,2020-10-16 21:52:21,Twitter for iPhone,7,16,covid; 
Toured Lakes Region Comm. College this morning to learn more about their workforce programs. LRCC has been able to use CARES Act funds to keep students safe during the COVID-19 pandemic expand training programs and connect students with jobs at local manufacturers. #NHPolitics https://t.co/PpgoHUh2fL,2020-10-14 16:11:49,Twitter for iPhone,9,17,covid; 
I hope President Trump and the First Lady have a quick and full recovery from COVID-19. My thoughts are with them our country and the many others suffering from this virus.,2020-10-02 10:44:23,Twitter for iPhone,13,95,covid; 
Coronavirus relief for our households small businesses and communities can’t wait and I’m encouraged we will take up legislation tonight that meets the growing need and will save lives. #NHPolitics #NH01,2020-09-30 20:55:23,Twitter for iPhone,2,18,corona; 
Rushing a Supreme Court nomination through the Senate while a COVID relief package remains stalled is a disgrace especially when it’s being done to take away health care and basic rights.  The American people will see through this farce. #NHPolitics #NH01,2020-09-26 22:28:36,Twitter for iPhone,62,214,covid; 
We need to ensure our schools are safe and prepared for in person and remote learning. That’s why I’m fighting for this legislation to ensure FEMA reimburses communities for PPE and other COVID-19 expenses.  #NHPolitics #NH01 https://t.co/h2wJPxhdjS,2020-09-20 21:45:05,Twitter for iPhone,12,20,covid; 
Our schools are working hard to ensure a safe start to the school year. FEMA's last minute decision not to offer reimbursements for COVID expenses is wrong.  I've co-sponsored legislation to reverse this decision and will keep working to move it forward. https://t.co/SSua8kmAJi,2020-09-18 19:09:04,Twitter for iPhone,6,18,covid; 
Facts are stubborn things. And the facts (and the tapes) prove that it didn’t have to be this way. The President downplayed the danger of COVID-19 from the start and our country is paying dearly.  https://t.co/aZUnRlRLm8,2020-09-10 02:03:58,Twitter for iPhone,19,59,covid; 
COVID-19 has upended our economy but our communities are pulling together. Thanks to local leaders in Portsmouth for creating a safe outdoor dining and entertainment venue with PopUpNH. I’ll continue to advocate for more support for our small businesses in these uncertain times. https://t.co/xA0lc75rh0,2020-08-31 17:29:37,Twitter for iPhone,6,25,covid; 
First stop of the day at Enna Chocolate in Exeter to discuss the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Main Street businesses. Thank you to Enna for hosting us and @JonMorganNH and Select Board members for joining us! https://t.co/aI6g9POqdn,2020-08-31 15:20:42,Twitter for iPhone,4,14,covid; 
Nearly 1 in 5 New Hampshire workers commute out of state for work. While many are teleworking because of COVID-19 it is completely unfair for states like Massachusetts to levy an income tax on people working in NH.   This bill will help ⬇️ https://t.co/aNYJyJBay3,2020-08-08 14:53:47,TweetDeck,10,51,covid; 
Cities towns and counties need support to maintain essential services like education health fire EMS and law enforcement.   We can't keep communities safe and healthy without federal funds in the next COVID-19 bill.  My op-ed with @SenatorHosmer ⬇️  https://t.co/7hecUs0btS,2020-08-06 17:00:07,TweetDeck,5,7,covid; 
We must do better than the GOP COVID relief proposal:  ❌ $1.75b for new FBI hq but nothing for state/local government to protect jobs &amp; services  ❌ $7b for weapons but nothing for food or rental assistance  ❌ Tax deductions for business lunches but scraps for those out of work,2020-07-29 01:18:57,Twitter for iPhone,24,80,covid; 
Delays in COVID-19 test results are putting people at risk for their lives. I spoke with @WMUR9 about the need to increase testing and contact tracing capacity. That's what I'm advocating for in upcoming legislation.    https://t.co/TxkpRMnrWX,2020-07-24 19:05:49,TweetDeck,9,19,covid; 
This is no strategy to take on a global pandemic or protect American lives. Retreating from the world stage will only hurt COVID-19 response efforts and embolden China.  This isn’t leadership. This is recklessness. https://t.co/pEHVA3paIa,2020-07-08 00:06:39,Twitter for iPhone,18,46,covid;

Running the @bostonmarathon is an experience unlike any other. Today thousands of runners stayed home to ensure that we all stay safe. Our COVID-19 response is a marathon effort.

Driving down to DC tonight so I can vote tomorrow on the coronavirus response package.   Support for our workers small businesses and hospitals can’t wait.
