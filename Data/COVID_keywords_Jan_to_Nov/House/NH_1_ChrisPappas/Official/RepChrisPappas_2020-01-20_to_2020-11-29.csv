This morning I met with representatives from New Hampshire Public Health Networks to discuss COVID-19 response and vaccine planning.   These public health professionals do critical work and I'm committed to getting more federal resources to help communities fight this pandemic. https://t.co/IqOcYUfGd8,2020-11-20 18:05:09,TweetDeck,2,14,covid; 
Legislation I helped introduce and voted to pass would get schools in Manchester and across the state critical emergency funds.  We must ensure that our students and teachers have the supplies and resources they need to prevent the spread of COVID-19.  https://t.co/a8lOAFTQXU,2020-11-18 14:59:02,TweetDeck,4,9,covid; 
The legislation we passed in the House today would correct that wrong. It also will help ease the overall financial burden on state and local governments as they deal with unprecedented revenue shortfalls and increased COVID-19 expenses.,2020-11-17 21:39:33,TweetDeck,0,6,covid; 
Earlier this year FEMA abruptly changed course to end reimbursements to local governments and schools for PPE and other COVID-19 expenses.   The House just passed legislation I helped introduce to restore that funding so students and teachers stay safe.   https://t.co/BETvnGz7wN,2020-11-17 21:37:22,TweetDeck,2,8,covid; 
New Hampshire families are experiencing heartbreaking loss from the pandemic and nothing can make up for the loss of loved ones taken by this terrible disease.  I join all of New Hampshire in mourning the 500 Granite Staters who have died from COVID-19.   https://t.co/DV3NnQleGD,2020-11-17 00:47:37,TweetDeck,2,14,covid; 
As the weather grows colder and families across our state continue to grapple with the far-reaching economic impacts of COVID-19 it is critical we continue to fund social safety nets such as energy assistance programs.  https://t.co/SnlyPPdeJp,2020-11-09 23:59:32,TweetDeck,2,15,covid; 
Congratulations to President-Elect Joe Biden and Vice President-Elect Kamala Harris.

New Hampshire's first responders go above and beyond to keep our communities healthy and safe. But throughout this pandemic they have been asked to do even more on the front lines of our COVID-19 response.  On #NationalFirstRespondersDay we say thank you.,2020-10-28 22:39:27,TweetDeck,3,18,covid; 
Stopped by Ragged Mountain Equipment in Intervale today to check in with their team.   When COVID-19 hit they received PPP and EIDL loans to keep their lights on and pay their employees. Then they transitioned to producing critical PPE to help in our response effort. https://t.co/AzSZhSXpZf,2020-10-22 22:15:00,TweetDeck,4,18,covid; 
As we continue to deal with the impacts of COVID-19 providing quality care for our seniors could not be more important.

Today I toured @Vapotherm in Exeter. As COVID-19 hit they added staff and overcame supply chain disruptions to produce life-saving respirators. In Congress I’ve fought to get New Hampshire manufacturers more support and added stability to help drive our economic recovery. https://t.co/fMOrT2yqvp,2020-10-19 19:53:38,Twitter for iPhone,3,7,covid; 
Visited Wolfeboro Town Hall to check in with Police Chief Rondeau Fire Chief Skantze @SenJeb and Town Manager James Pineo.   I'm fighting for direct support for local governments to pay police and fire fighters and maintain other critical services as we deal with COVID-19. https://t.co/UknCsg4Udk,2020-10-13 21:25:32,TweetDeck,6,11,covid; 
I also got an update from the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force. Calls and tips tripled during COVID-19 and CARES Act funds helped meet that increased volume.   I supported additional dollars so the important work of keeping kids safe continues. https://t.co/v0pvg04LX0,2020-10-05 19:56:32,Twitter Web App,0,2,covid; 
I joined several of my House colleagues calling on Speaker Pelosi to put forward and pass a COVID-19 relief bill.  This political stalemate has gone on long enough.

We aren't going down without a fight on this issue.  Granite Staters working from home due to COVID-19 shouldn't be forced to pay Massachusetts income tax.  Legislation I am leading would protect our workers from an income tax. This is about fairness.  https://t.co/4Yjpbq32C3,2020-09-27 14:43:37,TweetDeck,7,16,covid; 
Thousands of airline and aviation workers are set to be furloughed at the end of this month when COVID relief funding expires. That is why I am fighting to extend the Payroll Support Program to ensure that airline workers - including those at #MHT - can continue to be protected. https://t.co/frPNh5gCxg,2020-09-25 21:06:40,TweetDeck,6,15,covid; 
Today I joined @TaxFoundation to discuss the Multi-State Worker Tax Fairness Act legislation I co-sponsored. It eliminates overly complex and unfair multi-state tax codes and ensures Granite Staters working from home due to COVID-19 aren't forced to pay Massachusetts income tax. https://t.co/39hkP7CTgE,2020-09-23 21:10:10,TweetDeck,11,22,covid; 
Today I led a @VetAffairsDems oversight hearing examining supply chain issues within VA that continue to undermine the Department’s response to COVID-19.

COVID-19 has put too many Granite Staters at risk of losing their home or unable to find suitable housing through no fault of their own. These CARES Act funds will help our most vulnerable neighbors weather this storm with a roof over their heads.  https://t.co/BTOwLF6BMD,2020-09-16 17:47:50,TweetDeck,2,4,covid; 
Today is International Overdose Awareness Day. COVID-19 has exacerbated the conditions that contribute to addiction and overdose.

Yesterday I met with a Granite Stater who like thousands of others is working from home during COVID-19. But Massachusetts is still levying an income tax on that telework.   That shouldn't happen. That's why I helped introduce legislation to stop it.  https://t.co/XxcWkcwqlp,2020-08-28 16:11:21,TweetDeck,2,17,covid; 
From treatment interruptions to social isolation COVID-19 has heightened the stressors that contribute to the addiction crisis.

I remain disappointed that leaders in Congress and the White House have been unable to reach a compromise on the next COVID-19 legislation. But the President simply does not have the Constitutional authority to act without Congress in this way.

New Hampshire residents working from home to protect their family and community from COVID-19 should not be penalized with an income tax.   This legislation would protect teleworking Granite Staters from out-of-state income taxes.   https://t.co/XIEHokinlf,2020-08-09 16:30:07,TweetDeck,2,5,covid; 
Yesterday I joined a group of New Hampshire small business entrepreneurs to discuss the challenges they are facing with COVID-19.

Because of COVID-19 local governments are struggling to provide critical services like police fire health care and education.

The National Guard has been crucial to protecting and supporting Granite Staters throughout the COVID-19 crisis.  I joined calls for their activation to be extended but full federal support for the Guard’s deployment remains vital.  https://t.co/F9orsLCuBA,2020-08-05 19:41:35,TweetDeck,1,5,covid; 
This morning I visited C3I in Exeter to talk with owner Mike Curry and his team about how important a PPP loan was to his business.

The news of increased wait times for getting COVID-19 test results back is alarming. If Granite Staters can't get a result in a timely fashion then we put more individuals at risk.
