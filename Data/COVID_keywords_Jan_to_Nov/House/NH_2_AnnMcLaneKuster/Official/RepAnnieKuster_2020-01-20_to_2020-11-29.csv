#COVID19 put add’l burdens on family-owned farms &amp; many can't access support due to high enrollment fund requirements.

The @CDCgov estimates over half of #COVID19 infections are transmitted by people w/out symptoms meaning the majority of people who get COVID were infected by someone who unknowingly transmitted it to them.  We can all take steps to stop the spread. When in doubt wear your mask. https://t.co/fWvHUWwEOg,2020-11-23 20:19:45,Twitter Media Studio,2,12,covid; 
The @CDCgov now estimates that more than half of all #COVID19 infections are transmitted from people who are not showing symptoms.  This means the majority of new infections are from people who do not know they’re infecting others.  Wearing a mask is simply the right thing to do. https://t.co/1956Zh0sUM,2020-11-21 15:10:29,Twitter for iPhone,9,18,covid;

In NH &amp; across the US people are committed to helping one another through the #COVID19 crisis but sadly some see a chance to make a quick buck instead of lending a helping hand.

My heart breaks for the families &amp; loved ones of the 500 Granite Staters who have lost their lives as a result of COVID-19.
