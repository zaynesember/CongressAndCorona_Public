House Democrats promised they would work with @HouseGOP members on another COVID-19 relief bill with or without Pelosi. Well the time has come to make good on that promise because American workers are struggling. @GOPLeader https://t.co/oE5QY5QSVY,2020-11-23 16:47:56,Twitter Web App,1,1,covid; 
Thanks to American ingenuity and @POTUS's Operation Warp Speed we are breaking all records for having an available coronavirus vaccine. This is great news! America can’t afford another lockdown. https://t.co/HAoF1G1yAU,2020-11-16 17:00:03,joe.sentry,2,3,corona; 
Even the media and members of her own party agree: Nancy Pelosi has failed the American people by refusing to work with the White House on COVID relief. The House needs fresh leadership that will do its job and provide help for our workers and families. https://t.co/nC1co9wN3A,2020-10-14 14:39:27,Twitter Web App,1,0,covid; 
CHINA While China was originating spreading &amp; hiding key information on #Covid19 #KamalaHarris was busy impeaching @realDonaldTrump.   #Biden spent 47 yers kow-towing to China.  #PresidentTrump challenged China forcing them to stop stealing American jobs patents &amp; technology.,2020-10-08 01:56:27,Twitter for iPad,1,2,covid; 
Despite the odds our recovery continues and unemployment falls once again. If Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats would come to the table on serious COVID-19 relief talks it would be dropping much faster. https://t.co/OoVI3FZwWs,2020-10-02 18:00:02,joe.sentry,3,2,covid;

Republicans are working to get workers and businesses the relief they need but Dems are blocking those efforts.
