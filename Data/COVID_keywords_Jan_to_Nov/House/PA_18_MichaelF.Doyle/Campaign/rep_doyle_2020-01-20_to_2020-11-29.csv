Just a few things missing from your list @GOP:  - Prevent the spread of #COVID19 and build our economy back - Ensure every American has access to quality healthcare - #ActOnClimate - #EndGunViolence - Combat racial injustice  The moon sounds like a good place for you. https://t.co/SnjY45gvV6,2020-10-23 21:05:19,Twitter for iPhone,0,1,covid; 
.@realdonaldtrump looks like you still have no plan to address #COVID19 or provide healthcare to millions of Americans but one of your top priorities for 2021 is a multi-billion dollar spectrum giveaway to your GOP cronies... https://t.co/SnjY45gvV6,2020-10-23 21:00:16,Twitter for iPhone,0,5,covid; 
The House passed the #HeroesAct in May to help struggling Americans during #COVID19.   @realDonaldTrump spent all summer on the golf course instead of negotiating a deal while working Americans weren’t able to make ends meet. #DebateTonight,2020-10-23 02:45:21,Twitter for iPhone,1,4,covid; 
Presidents are leaders - and they should lead by example. Donald Trump spent months spreading false information about #COVID19 downplaying the American lives impacted and refusing to wear a mask. That's not leadership - we need @JoeBiden's integrity in the White House.,2020-10-20 01:02:48,Twitter for iPhone,0,2,covid;
