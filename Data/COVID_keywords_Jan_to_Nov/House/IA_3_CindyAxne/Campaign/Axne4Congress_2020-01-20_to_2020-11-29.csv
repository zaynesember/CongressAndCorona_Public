Cases and hospitalizations are spiking in Iowa.  Businesses say they're on the brink.  More federal #COVID19 protections expire on January 1st.  Additional aid can't wait until 2021.  #IA03  https://t.co/gn7THuHJga,2020-11-07 22:21:00,TweetDeck,8,71,covid; 
From natural disasters to the ongoing #COVID19 crisis Iowans have been through so much these past 2 years.  We have our work cut out for us – but I’m confident that we can pull together to overcome these challenges and build a brighter future for all.  #IA03 https://t.co/NsbAC6XH5D,2020-11-02 22:14:08,Twitter Media Studio,5,18,covid; 
Iowa's restaurants &amp; service industry have been hit particularly hard by #COVID19.  As a small business owner I know how important it is to protect these community cornerstones – and I've fought for tangible relief to help keep their doors open.  #IA03 https://t.co/RbdNoy9I0m,2020-10-30 15:15:08,Twitter Web App,11,18,covid; 
With so many of our child care facilities closed down by #COVID19 we should recognize how central this infrastructure is to our communities &amp; the larger economy.  Thanks for having me @SCActionNetwork! https://t.co/E06iWe5dEu,2020-10-29 23:55:02,Twitter Web App,4,16,covid; 
Maybe instead of laughing at campaigns taking #COVID19 seriously the Governor should be answering some questions herself. Here's one:   Are new records for hospitalizations and cases (2500 in a day!) going to change your mind on ignoring CDC/White House recommendations? https://t.co/sA9u8hUBUE,2020-10-29 15:32:12,Twitter Web App,92,286,covid; 
From multiple natural disasters to the brutal effects of #COVID19 – families in #IA03 have been through so much in the past 2 years.  And we've still got a ways to go.

With hospitalizations for #COVID19 in Iowa setting new records access to quality affordable health care has to be a priority during this crisis.  The future of our health care is on the ballot in #IA03. https://t.co/tno1iA96s0,2020-10-25 23:00:00,Twitter Web App,8,34,covid; 
Thousands of new #COVID19 cases a day.  The future of our health care system headed for the Supreme Court.  This is why Iowans tell me that health care is the #1 issue in this election.  #IA03 https://t.co/hirVqXZlhl,2020-10-22 22:04:47,Twitter Web App,8,15,covid; 
The economic fallout from the #COVID19 crisis has forced many Iowa families to make tough financial choices amidst job losses &amp; widespread uncertainty.  I promise to keep fighting in Washington to deliver assistance for Iowans still in need.  #IA03 https://t.co/U8YQq5ZfhJ,2020-10-21 20:01:48,Twitter Media Studio,27,45,covid;

These staggering case counts in Iowa are a reminder that #COVID19 hasn’t left our state.  It also shows us that now – more than ever – all Iowans need access to quality affordable health care.   #IA03  https://t.co/NRfgPC0bAw,2020-10-13 23:36:51,Twitter Web App,6,10,covid;

Cindy Axne has been pushing for a simplified compromise #COVID19 package for months – and has been urging congressional leaders to meet in the middle to deliver aid for #IA03.  https://t.co/IifRoWHBO2,2020-10-13 00:09:14,Twitter Web App,3,6,covid; 
Over my first term folks in #IA03’s rural communities have faced #COVID19 a trade war historic floods &amp; a derecho.  I will work with both parties to support those affected by these crises to improve the lives of rural Iowans. ⤵️ https://t.co/jDqwr3kNiQ https://t.co/YmjyZmbAVl,2020-10-12 15:45:53,Twitter Web App,5,14,covid; 
Between a derecho trade war and the economic issues exacerbated by #COVID19 our farmers &amp; rural families have been through a lot these past 2 years.  Thank you @DSMpartnership for letting me talk about the importance of having farmers' backs in #IA03. https://t.co/o9QtAzJmHa,2020-10-09 23:28:26,Twitter Web App,11,22,covid; 
The challenges brought on by #COVID19 aren't over in Iowa.  Today – and everyday – we need to make sure we're doing everything we can to keep our families &amp; communities safe.  #IA03 https://t.co/U3oqxQ1hJB,2020-10-08 23:06:10,Twitter Web App,20,24,covid; 
I’ve fought for Iowans through the crises that we have faced over these past two years.  From flooding and the trade war to #COVID19 – I’ve worked across the aisle and stood up to my own party when needed – and always put Iowa first.  #IA03 https://t.co/KGG062vHJX,2020-10-08 19:08:39,Twitter Media Studio,7,51,covid;

FACT CHECK: True  For months Cindy has pushed congressional leadership and the White House to meet in the middle on a compromise package that could deliver aid for Iowans and help combat #COVID19.  #IA03  https://t.co/IifRoWHBO2,2020-10-07 21:33:11,Twitter Web App,3,10,covid;

As we continue responding to #COVID19 &amp; its economic fallout this is the WORST POSSIBLE MOMENT to gut critical health care protections.  We can’t afford to turn our backs on our seniors pregnant mothers and families still facing this crisis.  #IA03 https://t.co/GW43BwhVHv,2020-10-03 20:40:53,Twitter Web App,25,49,covid; 
As #COVID19 continues to spread in Iowa refusing to budge on additional relief won't help the families &amp; communities still in need.   After pushing for a revised aid package we're closer than we've been in months – and we need to reach a deal ASAP. #IA03 https://t.co/kSkFEBwVd0 https://t.co/3i0D4EscxW,2020-10-03 16:24:57,Twitter Web App,1,9,covid; 
As we all wish the President and First Lady a full and fast recovery from #COVID19 - we must see this is a reminder that this virus can affect anyone.  It takes all of us following the advice of our medical experts to slow the spread of this disease. #IA03 https://t.co/qetpZxmKUc,2020-10-02 21:56:36,Twitter Web App,3,13,covid; 
Health care was the #1 issue in our last election – now w/ #COVID19 and vital protections (like for preex conditions) still at risk 2020 is no different.  I don’t just promise to protect Iowans’ care I vote to do so – and have fought to lower those costs for Iowa families.#IA03 https://t.co/sQIa13f0Jm,2020-10-02 18:15:23,Twitter for iPhone,12,27,covid; 
The persistence of #COVID19 in our communities is a reminder of how important access to health care is for Iowa’s families.  I am committed to expanding access to affordable quality health care and to supporting our hospitals &amp; health clinics.  #IA03 https://t.co/VXKZsQoCdA,2020-09-30 20:10:34,Twitter Web App,9,17,covid; 
Rebuilding our economy amid the #COVID19 crisis shouldn’t be about tax breaks for big corporations – or cutting Medicare &amp; Social Security benefits.  It should be about putting Iowa’s middle-class families first.  #IA03 https://t.co/VTdqN0iLR6,2020-09-29 17:12:40,Twitter Media Studio,4,18,covid; 
Now – in the middle of a global pandemic and economic crisis – is the worst possible moment to put millions of Americans’ health care at risk by repealing the ACA.  We need to build on &amp; expand its protections as #IA03 grapples w/ the effects of #COVID19. https://t.co/RqpGPV4sYm,2020-09-27 21:02:37,Twitter Web App,12,17,covid; 
We also need to keep working to expand and keep telemedicine available for those hit hardest by #COVID19.  Together we can make sure every Iowan gets the care they deserve. Will you join me in this fight #IA03? (3/3)⬇️ https://t.co/5odWZu8p7h,2020-09-25 16:01:09,Twitter Web App,3,3,covid; 
3 of every 5 child care facilities have closed from #COVID19 – and many report their closures may be permanent.  If we don't directly address the looming child care crisis millions of working families will be left behind &amp; we won't be able to get our economy back on track. #IA03 https://t.co/iV7DgZgmn9,2020-09-19 14:28:43,Twitter Web App,8,30,covid; 
While I’d love to be out shaking hands giving hugs &amp; high-fives – and filling our rally halls – #COVID19 has meant campaigning looks a little different this year.  Proud of @polkdems for showing that we can still organize without putting Iowans at risk.👍 https://t.co/LvBwu34PDd,2020-09-18 00:26:00,Twitter Web App,7,26,covid; 
Our schools small businesses and health services are still under immense pressure from #COVID19.  Folks need help to ensure they can keep a roof over their heads and food on their table.

The tragic loss of one of @DMschools' dedicated educators is a sobering reminder of the risks facing our schools &amp; communities.  We need to allow districts to make decisions that will best protect their students and staff from the spread of #COVID19. #IA03 https://t.co/qR3KbgdzIj,2020-09-02 18:27:33,Twitter Web App,4,20,covid; 
Last week Iowa was reporting over 1000 positive cases a day – and we're at the top of the list nationally.

This crisis is far from over in Iowa.  #COVID19 case counts are hitting new records.  Unemployment claims are climbing again and we're having to re-close businesses to slow the spread.

Iowa's housing advocates saying loud &amp; clear that #COVID19 is going to make Iowa's housing challenges more difficult.

Thousands of Iowans are still:  ❌ out of work  ❌ struggling to keep food on their table  ❌ worried about sending their kids back to school  ❌ unsure how to make rent on Sept. 1  Political stalemate on additional #COVID19 relief is not an option. #IA03  https://t.co/nKF99foeEy https://t.co/rQZOXQnlMn,2020-08-20 19:34:52,Twitter Web App,6,12,covid;

Businesses that rely on Iowa's biggest events of the year like the State Fair or RAGBRAI are facing losses from #COVID19 that could devastate local #IA03 economies.

Because of the Affordable Care Act 20 million additional Americans gained quality affordable health care. Now more than ever we need to build on that and give uninsured Americans the opportunity to get insured under a special enrollment period for COVID-19. Enough. #TeamJoe,2020-04-02 02:36:30,Twitter Web App,16,50,covid;
