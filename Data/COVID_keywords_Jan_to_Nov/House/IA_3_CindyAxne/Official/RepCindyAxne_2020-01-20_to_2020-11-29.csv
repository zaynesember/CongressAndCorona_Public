Without a new #COVID19 relief deal in 2020 things won't just stay the same – things will get worse.  Losing programs expiring on 1/1 will hurt more Americans.

New #COVID19 cases &amp; hospitalizations in Iowa are among the worst in the nation.

Thank you @GrowthEnergy for having me on your Biofuels Champion Series to talk about illegal #SRE waivers upholding the #RFS and why we need to have the backs of our ethanol producers as we push for another #COVID19 aid package. #IA03 https://t.co/d7jVsOWk9Y,2020-08-26 18:05:10,Twitter Web App,3,7,covid; 
#COVID19 was already straining local budgets before the #derecho struck.  @RepFinkenauer @DaveLoebsack @RepCasten @RepCheri @RepBillFoster and are urging congressional leaders &amp; @WhiteHouse to approve state &amp; local aid to help these devastated towns.  https://t.co/czeLWfUqow,2020-08-26 14:50:00,Twitter Web App,3,13,covid; 
Local governments were already facing strained budgets from #COVID19 before the #derecho struck the Midwest.  Today I led a letter to @WhiteHouse &amp; congressional leaders urging them to approve a #COVID19 aid deal that includes critical funding for local governments &amp; services. https://t.co/QbzstvGO43,2020-08-24 17:06:17,Twitter Media Studio,9,36,covid; 
In 9 days rent is due again for thousands of #IA03 families.  We need to reach a deal ASAP to help them &amp; others.  @POTUS @SenateMajLdr &amp; @SpeakerPelosi – we need to approve #COVID19 aid that tackles unemployment local aid schools treatment &amp; more.  https://t.co/BgCF5arjUx https://t.co/NTgcxF1YM1,2020-08-22 23:50:00,Twitter Web App,5,15,covid;

'Take it or leave it' doesn't work when the Senate has 'left it' for months &amp; failed to pass any #COVID19 relief for those still in need.  I've called on @SpeakerPelosi to bring up a revised bill to help families schools businesses &amp; communities. #IA03 https://t.co/n1WPbwc9F5,2020-08-20 21:41:05,Twitter Web App,4,16,covid; 
Over the past month the need for additional #COVID19 relief has only grown.  Iowans should not be forced to settle for political stalemate.  I'm calling on @SpeakerPelosi to bring up a revised &amp; robust COVID-19 aid package when the House returns this week. #IA03 https://t.co/bCnu61ozld,2020-08-19 15:28:34,Twitter Web App,7,27,covid; 
Less than 150 days ago we lost the first Iowan to #COVID19.  Now we mourn over 1000.  But these deaths cannot become just numbers to us.  They are our neighbors friends and cherished family members – and we must remember them all and fight this virus in their memory. #IA03 https://t.co/Kae8X2aw3w,2020-08-19 14:16:11,Twitter Web App,5,18,covid; 
Without clear accountability and answers Iowans don’t know the risks and facts about COVID-19 in our state. We need Iowa officials to fix this problem and restore our confidence in data. (4/4)  #IA03  https://t.co/XQTztyetQA,2020-08-18 23:01:59,Twitter Web App,2,11,covid; 
Stopped by Urbandale’s R Jones Collision 1 to meet @GS10KSmallBiz graduates and discuss how their operations have been affected by #COVID19 and the recent storm – as well as ways can get federal policy in place to support Iowa’s entrepreneurs. #IA03 https://t.co/GVQQNSQQUb,2020-08-18 21:14:07,Twitter for iPhone,2,8,covid; 
It is unacceptable that portions of this federal aid are still under review including funds that will help Iowans deal with damage at their homes – especially as access to safe shelter remains a critical priority during #COVID19. (2/3)  https://t.co/wmiEgiUWiQ,2020-08-18 15:38:40,Twitter Web App,8,21,covid; 
Ensuring Iowans w/ elevated #COVID19 risk can continue to utilize telehealth is key to protecting #IA03 communities in the coming months of this pandemic.  Proud to join this bipartisan group urging congressional leaders to help continue these services. https://t.co/Iw4u2sH4Qh,2020-08-13 18:20:04,Twitter Web App,2,6,covid; 
Countless rural communities across Iowa rely on their local @USPS to get their prescription medications important documents and even paychecks.   Especially during #COVID19 we cannot allow postal delays to endanger or disenfranchise Iowa families. #IA03 https://t.co/l2Gk5BiykR,2020-08-12 16:41:11,Twitter Web App,4,10,covid;

Our rural businesses are under burdens and pressures during #COVID19 - proud to sponsor the Rural Equal Aid Act with @SenatorTester @SenAngusKing @SenatorRomney &amp; @sendavidperdue to extend the same SBA borrower relief in CARES Act to USDA borrowers. https://t.co/UFeRsv4La4,2020-08-06 21:46:29,Twitter for iPhone,4,9,covid; 
After learning from @AmerMedicalAssn &amp; @FAHhospitals that providers could lose &gt;20% of their #COVID19 aid to taxes I introduced a commonsense fix with @DrNealDunnFL2 to prevent Congressional aid for our hospitals and health centers from being taxed. #IA03 https://t.co/R8EEsg66ts,2020-08-06 14:53:46,Twitter Web App,10,15,covid;

I fought to get specific relief for biofuels included in the House's version of the next #COVID19 relief bill.  Our producers and the rural communities that they support need more than a promise that we'll urge @USDA to remember ethanol this time. #IA03 https://t.co/vEBpTPKLNF,2020-08-05 14:19:36,Twitter Web App,5,20,covid;

As we continue negotiations on our next #COVID19 aid bill I’m discussing the priorities it needs to include with folks who’ve been on the front lines providing for those in need – like @CapCityFruit in Norwalk who has distributed &gt;30k boxes of food to Iowa families. #IA03 https://t.co/xBF3irU4p7,2020-08-04 16:59:19,Twitter for iPhone,1,7,covid;

Help keep your community safe – in addition to following social distancing guidelines wear a mask to help slow the spread of #COVID19 in our public spaces stores and businesses and other places where keeping 6 feet apart is difficult.  #MaskUp 😷  https://t.co/2cAy2XU49J,2020-08-03 15:06:39,Twitter Web App,4,10,covid; 
.@SecretarySonny has made it clear he isn't interested in using @USDA's #COVID19 aid to help our biofuel industry.  That's why I fought to get specific language in the House's bill to help biofuels.  We need that language to ensure aid is delivered. #IA03 https://t.co/vEBpTPtap5,2020-08-01 15:45:17,Twitter Web App,7,23,covid; 
I’m disappointed that it took the Senate until this week – when millions of Americans faced a financial cliff that takes away eviction protections and enhanced unemployment benefits – to even introduce their version of a COVID-19 aid bill and come to the negotiating table. (2/9),2020-07-31 13:40:27,Twitter Web App,0,2,covid; 
Even as Congress is working through appropriations bills and debating COVID aid - there's other important legislation that is getting closer to becoming law!  Yesterday a crucial bill that improves flood protection &amp; recovery processes passed the House UNANIMOUSLY. #WRDA #IA03 https://t.co/RloYzDlDvD,2020-07-30 20:36:49,Twitter Media Studio,10,13,covid;

The end of the eviction moratorium &amp; federal unemployment benefits weren't surprise deadlines.

#COVID19 has devastated the child care sector– forcing closures and exacerbating the shortage of quality affordable care.   That’s why we're advancing two bills today to provide relief for families and providers and support the safe reopening of our economy. #SaveChildCare #IA03 https://t.co/oOFB68WTHx,2020-07-29 18:19:23,Twitter Web App,11,26,covid; 
In the past week we've lost 27 Iowans in our long-term care facilities to #COVID19 – and there's been a 47% increase in cases in our nursing homes.  Iowans living in group homes need the testing and attention equal to the elevated threat they face. #IA03  https://t.co/yTNJFwixOM,2020-07-28 15:49:49,Twitter Web App,2,5,covid; 
A change in formula could force Iowa health care providers to return federal aid that they've used to keep serving our communities during #COVID19.  I wrote to @HHSgov with @RepDonBacon to ensure that these essential funds are not revoked. #IA03  https://t.co/M6pZcYnl9F,2020-07-27 16:51:01,Twitter Web App,3,9,covid;

The CARES Act has provided millions to keep Iowa hospitals &amp; health centers open during #COVID19.
