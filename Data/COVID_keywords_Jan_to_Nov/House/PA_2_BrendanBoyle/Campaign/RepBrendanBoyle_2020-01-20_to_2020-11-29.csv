No US state has a bigger #COVID19 crisis than South Dakota. This a direct result of the failed leadership of Gov Kristi Noem. She should end her laughable run for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination and instead do her job. https://t.co/squ75fG5j5,2020-11-21 04:09:32,Twitter for iPhone,15,163,covid;

The American people desperately need more financial help from our federal government as we deal with the worst #COVID outbreak yet.,2020-11-13 04:04:49,Twitter for iPhone,14,84,covid; 
Folks Donald Trump is lying. House Democrats have passed two different #COVID relief bills. The GOP refuses to even allow a vote on them in the Senate. #debates,2020-10-23 01:58:43,Twitter for iPhone,32,129,covid; 
Congrats to #JacindaAdern - How I wish my country had a smart empathetic leader who could guide us through #COVID19 with almost no deaths. Counting down the days until a #PresidentBiden,2020-10-18 02:43:15,Twitter for iPhone,16,151,covid;

Incredible. How many people have been infected with #COVID because of Trump’s irresponsibility? https://t.co/Um0wDi1gJd,2020-10-13 16:26:14,Twitter for iPhone,115,267,covid;

Wow. My sympathies with @gtconway3d his wife @KellyannePolls (who once was the pollster for my opponent) and their family. What an awful virus COVID is . . . https://t.co/5ec0gG6djr,2020-10-03 02:25:56,Twitter for iPhone,11,36,covid; 
My best wishes to @realDonaldTrump and @FLOTUS for a speedy recovery from COVID-19. Far too many families have had to suffer because of this virus.,2020-10-02 10:29:59,Twitter for iPhone,5,52,covid; 
I totally agree. I mean who could have guessed questions about obscure topics like COVID health care policing and climate would have come up? https://t.co/zAZdaRI59a,2020-09-18 02:25:44,Twitter for iPhone,34,387,covid; 
Donald Trump’s Inaugural Address was titled “American Carnage”. And that’s exactly he’s brought us. * 180000+ dead from COVID * Most job losses in 90 years  * Political violence on our streets   To end this carnage we need to vote Trump out.,2020-08-31 20:30:50,Twitter for iPhone,33,91,covid; 
In just the 4 days of the #RepublicanConvention more Americans have died from #COVID19 than died on 9/11. #RNC2020,2020-08-28 02:55:22,Twitter for iPhone,62,96,covid;

Meanwhile in the alternate universe President Hillary has just been impeached by the GOP Congress because 40000 Americans have died from COVID. This is the 2nd time they’ve impeached her the first being 2017 for her emails.,2020-08-26 02:19:18,Twitter for iPhone,26,96,covid; 
The sucking up to Trump at this  #RNCConvention would make even Kim Jong-Un blush.  But here’s the reality: the USA is only 4% of the world’s population but we have 25% of the world’s deaths to #COVID19. This is because of @realDonaldTrump’s failure as president. #GOPConvention,2020-08-25 01:22:04,Twitter for iPhone,61,164,covid;

Given his terrible leadership during #COVID has contributed the deaths of over 160000 Americans it is only fitting for Trump to give his acceptance speech in a cemetery. https://t.co/vAvmXknJT4,2020-08-10 18:49:56,Twitter for iPhone,27,78,covid;

We are 4% of the world’s population. We have 25% of the world’s #coronavirus deaths.  Not my definition of “great job.” https://t.co/2Xsm8JSlVB,2020-06-23 14:51:10,Twitter for iPhone,24,97,corona; 
We are 4% of the world’s population.  But we’re more than 25% of the global deaths from #COVID19.  Our federal governement’s handling of this pandemic was been one of the greatest failures in American history. #Trump,2020-06-11 01:24:57,Twitter for iPhone,42,108,covid; 
Disgraceful that members like my brother were needlessly put at risk because this reckless GOP member never bothered to tell people he tested positive for COVID-19. https://t.co/jcsXgtFEU8,2020-05-28 00:09:17,Twitter for iPhone,51,166,covid; 
Just a quick thank you to all the people I interact with every single day who are quietly enduring this crisis the right way. They go about their business wearing a mask staying 6-ft apart etc. There won’t be a viral video about them. But they deserve to be thanked. #COVID__19,2020-05-27 01:26:41,Twitter for iPhone,16,110,covid; 
Except there aren’t. The combined population of those countries is almost 500 million people. The US population is only 329 million. And yet we have more COVID19 cases despite having far fewer people. https://t.co/gzJto3eTJ4,2020-05-13 00:57:28,Twitter for iPhone,15,65,covid; 
More people in the United States have #COVID19 than Britain France Germany Russia Italy and Spain - COMBINED! This has been a catastrophic failure of leadership by @realDonaldTrump. He is the most incompetent leader in the world today. #Coronavirus,2020-05-13 00:31:26,Twitter for iPhone,94,251,covid; corona;

@ilovepaulmcc Our offices are physically closed due to COVID-19 but we are still working on constituent cases. In fact we processed far more cases last week than normal (as the demand for help has sadly increased).

Those of us with constituent offices interact with people every day. There is a lot of pain out there already. People I personally know who went from fine to out of work almost overnight.

Dear @JohnCornyn - A) I happen to like Corona and will keep drinking it. B) More importantly don’t you think you should be back in DC DOING YOUR DAMN JOB and passing the bill we passed at 1am?!?! https://t.co/n807JpoIwU,2020-03-14 22:37:00,Twitter for iPhone,27,156,corona; 
This is an excellent chart. We must learn from the painful lessons of my hometown’s experience a century ago when they carried on with a public parade that helped infect tens of thousands.

Two of my great grandparents died within one day of one another due to the Spanish Flu of 1918. Suddenly my grandmother was made an orphan.

It’s time for 🇺🇸 to join the rest of the industrialized world and have #PaidSickLeave. This #coronavirus illustrates why it’s important not just to those who need it but also to our economy. I’m proud to cosponsor the #PaidSickLeaveBill.,2020-03-09 22:23:48,Twitter for iPhone,33,166,corona;
