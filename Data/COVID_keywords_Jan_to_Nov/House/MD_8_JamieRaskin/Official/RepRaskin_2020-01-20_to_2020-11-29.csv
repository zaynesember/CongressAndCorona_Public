Turns out Trump who praised Chinese President Xi and his handling of the Coronavirus 37 times in the first 4 months of the pandemic has a secret bank account in China and paid hundreds of thousands in taxes—to China—while paying zip here. https://t.co/qEemo1RxIj,2020-10-21 14:07:46,Twitter for iPhone,815,1990,corona; 
A herd immunity “strategy” for COVID-19 is a death sentence for millions more Americans.

I hope for a swift recovery for all infected with COVID-19 including POTUS &amp; FLOTUS. We know from public health experts that face masks save lives. HHS Sec.
