Today is Small Business Saturday! This year more than ever it's important for us as a community to support our local businesses who have been affected by COVID-19. Let's #ShopSmall! https://t.co/XlHyQXyG86,2020-11-28 15:01:02,Sprout Social,8,12,covid; 
This is Pam Keith's closing message. Not fighting algal blooms. Not helping our community recover from coronavirus. But cheering on Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and engaging with national political analysts on the election administration in NYC. Pam Keith is #PoliticsBeforePeople. https://t.co/OXWnLpW7BE,2020-10-27 13:49:19,TweetDeck,10,47,corona; 
During the first several months of the coronavirus pandemic our team helped save more than 65000 jobs in our community by supporting small &amp; local businesses.  I'm proud to be named a "Guardian of Small Business" by @NFIB! https://t.co/tsipZdEhah,2020-10-25 22:30:04,Sprout Social,5,17,corona; 
Pam Keith supports hiking taxes by an average of more than $3000 per family.  In the midst of the economic recovery from coronavirus the last thing people need is a tax increase! https://t.co/AKSBpdwwAU,2020-10-22 20:00:29,Sprout Social,3,29,corona; 
Pam Keith's plan to immediately raise taxes by more than $3000 per family would be a disaster. I will continue to fight for lower taxes with a laser focus on the unique needs of our community as the coronavirus recovery continues. https://t.co/2SmQFYst4P,2020-10-19 19:00:33,Sprout Social,9,17,corona; 
During coronavirus my team and I helped 20000+ people in #FL18 with unemployment small business loans and more. Fair question to ask: what would Pam Keith have done to help when she says "You don’t give me your vote or your money I don’t gotta listen to you"? https://t.co/qR50cN8fn7,2020-10-17 21:30:14,Sprout Social,8,29,corona; 
What happened when coronavirus hit... 1) Our team individually assisted more than 20000 people &amp; helped save more than 65000 jobs in #FL18 2) Pam Keith incited violence against her political opponents suggesting an “open season” on conservatives. https://t.co/bCHktOfOvI,2020-09-21 19:30:40,Sprout Social,9,15,corona; 
Our team has worked around the clock during the coronavirus pandemic and through the Paycheck Protection Program we helped save more than 65000 jobs in our community. I will keep fighting with everything I've got to help EVERYONE in our community - people before politics! https://t.co/cIn7mK8nzj,2020-09-15 17:33:12,Sprout Social,5,14,corona; 
China owes a debt and needs to be held accountable for the part they played in the coronavirus. If you agree sign the petition: https://t.co/zGJLcM1JgU,2020-07-25 16:00:42,Sprout Social,4,4,corona; 
China owes a debt to the world because of their disgraceful handling of the coronavirus pandemic that has cost so many lives and countless economic damage.  As a Member of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China I am committed to holding them accountable! https://t.co/2t8MW0uJtD,2020-07-19 22:04:02,Sprout Social,7,22,corona; 
As we rebuild our economy from coronavirus I will continue to be a champion for small businesses and I am proud to have the support of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce! https://t.co/2vMVhLkZs6,2020-07-13 17:09:34,TweetDeck,3,4,corona; 
Thank you to EMTs and emergency medical services providers across our state and nation for being a reliable source of strength in times of need.

I am working to make sure Florida's produce growers have the resources they need to survive and feed our communities during the #COVID19 crisis! https://t.co/FRKtgZbeqo,2020-04-18 20:13:03,Sprout Social,3,16,covid;
