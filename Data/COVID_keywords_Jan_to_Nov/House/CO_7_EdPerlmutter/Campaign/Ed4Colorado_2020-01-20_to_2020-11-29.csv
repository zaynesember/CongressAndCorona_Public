Great to join @YadiraCaraveo and @Kyle_Mullica for their Labor Day Town Hall. While this weekend will be different with COVID what will be the same is our thanks to the labor movement for building our middle class and opportunity for all Americans. https://t.co/yl7U1H6J3D,2020-09-03 00:02:01,Twitter Web App,4,13,covid; 
150000+ Americans have died because Donald Trump refused to take COVID-19 seriously. So many of these deaths were preventable but instead Donald Trump just thinks “it is what it is.” https://t.co/TjV1tGUXg4,2020-08-04 20:24:08,Twitter Web App,1,0,covid; 
It’s clear this White House will not demonstrate the leadership needed to take on COVID-19. If we want sports to return this fall it’s on all of us to wear a mask social distance and stay home if you feel sick. https://t.co/GAdlNs29pP,2020-07-17 14:44:54,Twitter for iPhone,1,5,covid; social distance; 
This weekend is very different. Usually we'd gather outside at BBQs parades and fireworks shows – but for everyone's safety we will mostly stay home. It’s an unfortunate reality but COVID-19's severity could have been prevented with the right leadership in the White House.,2020-07-04 15:17:28,Twitter Web App,1,10,covid; 
Great to join @Zenzinger_AtoZ kicking off her re-election campaign for State Senate! Rachel has been a terrific Senator helping navigate Colorado through COVID-19 getting real results for hardworking folks. https://t.co/W4BR0ClQJx,2020-06-29 01:50:20,Twitter for iPhone,3,5,covid; 
Donald Trump is actively working in the middle of a pandemic to eliminate health care coverage for 20 million Americans and protections for pre-existing conditions like COVID-19. We must elect Joe Biden to protect the ACA and expand access to affordable health care. https://t.co/gbfQXukJHp,2020-06-26 22:18:14,Twitter for iPhone,6,5,covid; 
Great work by @georgestern launching Jeffco’s first mobile voting site that will allow people to social distance and vote in-person! https://t.co/ACEkIjUagn,2020-05-15 16:25:12,Twitter Web App,3,6,social distance; 
Colorado’s vote by mail system has increased participation in our elections by more than 9 percentage points. Every state should adopt a similar voting system to increase participation and keep people safe from COVID-19. https://t.co/DpzeJRw8zF,2020-05-04 21:18:55,Twitter Web App,95,298,covid; 
Teachers first responders and other government workers are heroes during the COVID-19 crisis but states could see large cuts impact many of them. My bill provides $500 billion to states including $8 billion for Colorado to prevent layoffs for our heroes and help states recover. https://t.co/OwNL48Wz6h,2020-05-01 15:41:14,Twitter Web App,1,2,covid; 
This is a tough time for many of us with loved ones dying and friends and family in the hospital. We need to stay home social distance and wear our masks to save lives for our parents grandparents and elderly neighbors. We can do this together. https://t.co/pgIAHrobei,2020-04-28 17:31:05,Twitter Web App,1,1,social distance; 
Mitch McConnell is fine giving the largest corporations big checks but when it comes to teachers cops and firefighters they’re on the chopping block. That’s why I’ve got a bill to give states $500 billion to fight COVID-19 and help our economy recover. https://t.co/sGKFAROrRI,2020-04-23 19:00:12,Twitter for iPhone,2,5,covid; 
Thank you to everyone who joined our Zoom Town Hall last night before the 7th CD Assembly ballots are sent out. We had a great conversation about our response to COVID-19 how to make sure people can participate in our elections and the economic recovery. https://t.co/nkEYWdERfA,2020-04-08 17:01:01,Twitter Web App,2,3,covid; 
Our community is fortunate to have organizations coming to the aid of our friends and neighbors. If you have the ability support one of these organizations helping to provide relief during COVID-19. https://t.co/rK5riJT2aC,2020-04-03 19:24:56,Twitter Web App,1,0,covid; 
Giving polluters a free pass to make our air and water dirty while we’re all trying to protect our health and safety is just wrong. Coronavirus should not be used by special interests to hurt our communities. https://t.co/CHCJ3eJoui,2020-03-27 16:30:33,Twitter for iPhone,3,2,corona; 
We need to be doing everything we can to stop the spread of COVID-19 to help our health care workers and save lives. Stay at home wash your hands frequently and if you have to go out stay at least six feet apart from other people. https://t.co/VebKvUsJbT,2020-03-24 14:15:00,TweetDeck,0,1,covid; 
I’ve heard from small businesses across our district experiencing unprecedented losses from COVID-19. I joined with Governor Polis urging the Small Business Administration to approve economic relief loans to help our local businesses and their workers. https://t.co/i1mdsYMsQO,2020-03-19 19:23:00,TweetDeck,2,2,covid; 
I joined @iansilverii and @jason_bane on the @MoreSmarterShow to discuss the federal response to COVID-19 and how each of us can play our part to defeat this pandemic. #copolitics https://t.co/kmaE6dNm9N,2020-03-19 16:58:00,Twitter Web App,1,6,covid; 
The Families First Act providing free COVID-19 testing emergency sick leave and support for food assistance programs has been signed into law. This is a key step but there's much more to do to help workers families and small businesses.https://t.co/PAio7iNckJ,2020-03-19 14:10:19,Twitter Web App,1,0,covid;
