First time in 10 years I’ve not participated in the Fancy Farm Picnic Political Speaking on the first Saturday in August. It was canceled due to COVID. I sure hope it returns next year because it’s one of the few times the KY press &amp; major political figures ever visit WKY! #KY1 https://t.co/tJ3Iq3ynEX,2020-08-01 11:54:27,Twitter for iPhone,30,189,covid; 
Good ⁦@BrietbartNews⁩ article on my recent ⁦FOX⁩ interview about how “out of touch” Biden is pledging to immediately rejoin ⁦@WHO⁩. The US pays 10x the annual dues China pays—not to mention the fact that WHO complied w/China’s #COVID lies https://t.co/F94Am0krCK,2020-07-11 23:23:26,Twitter for iPhone,81,141,covid; 
Joined a video conference to provide a Congressional update to the Americans for Tax Reform Center Right Coalition led by @GroverNorquist. Discussed future #COVID relief Trump Administration efforts to reduce burdensome regulations &amp; trade policy. @taxreformer https://t.co/psWQAIgS7l,2020-06-17 14:33:28,Twitter for iPhone,17,24,covid; 
Participated in Madisonville/Hopkins County #COVID19 Facebook Live Press Conference with Judge Jack Whitfield &amp; Mayor Kevin Cotton. Hopkins County has been the role model of how to communicate react &amp; reopen during a #pandemic. #KY1 https://t.co/MxQeXPmU7W,2020-06-10 16:57:03,Twitter for iPhone,13,18,covid; 
TX FL &amp; TN have been the 3 best run states over the past 15 years. They were the last to close because of #COVID19 &amp; the first to reopen. TX⬇️ statistics suggest that people are in fact capable of taking precautions while getting back to work. Hey KY less government is better: https://t.co/w9rhYD2KIU,2020-06-02 17:26:58,Twitter for iPhone,19,83,covid; 
I strongly support this decision by @realDonaldTrump. The #WorldHealthOrganization passed along Communist China Propaganda on #COVID that resulted in the loss of American lives. The President has now officially held the WHO accountable! ✅ https://t.co/sHBXJbagGH,2020-05-29 20:16:48,Twitter for iPhone,55,144,covid; 
Celebrated Kentucky’s #COVIDReopening of restaurants today at @texasroadhouse in Paducah. Hopefully this is one large step towards rebuilding our broken economy getting back to work &amp; returning to some sense of normalcy. #KY1 https://t.co/1ZiOmGmliv,2020-05-22 18:32:56,Twitter for iPhone,6,59,covid; 
Expressed my frustration on @FoxFriendsFirst that House D’s are still focused on impeachment! There are so many important issues related to #Covid_19 &amp; the economy that Congress should address. Impeachment is a democrat side show to make up for the lack of a legislative agenda! https://t.co/LZ0BVidLxS,2020-05-21 09:44:22,Twitter for iPhone,76,202,covid; 
Kentucky’s #COVID19 policy is a bad case of 1 size fits all. 10 Of my 35 southern KY counties have &gt;10 positive cases.  ✅Reopen KY economy now ✅Wear masks &amp; social distance ✅Close counties w/⬆️ cases ✅Reopen school this fall ✅Bring back sports w/no crowds ✅TN already open! https://t.co/kwIhJTLIS8,2020-05-16 15:28:03,Twitter for iPhone,64,218,covid; social distance; 
Thanks @GOPLeader for appointing a strong #COVID19 Oversight Select Committee. @SteveScalise will do a tremendous job leading and @Jim_Jordan @RepBlaine @RepWalorski &amp; @RepMarkGreen are all quality legislators who will seek the truth.,2020-05-07 14:25:52,Twitter for iPhone,110,489,covid; 
Joined Paducah Mayor Brandi Harless McCracken Judge Craig Clymer &amp; healthcare officials at a joint #COVID19 press conference at the McCracken County Emergency Management Complex in Paducah to discuss local &amp; federal response efforts. #KY1 https://t.co/mna1yeHixw,2020-05-01 20:37:51,Twitter for iPhone,8,30,covid; 
There are so many things Congress should be working on NOW like moving essential supply chain items from China to USA solving the #COVID19 outbreaks at our food processing plants and providing credible oversight on record spending. @SpeakerPelosi should reopen Congress NOW!,2020-04-29 13:20:03,Twitter for iPhone,50,154,covid; 
Pelosi wants to create a new “Select Committee” w/subpoena powers to oversee Trump’s response to #COVID19. A better idea is to use the Oversight Cmte (COR) for that role. No need to duplicate services. However the COR will need to stop wasting time on impeachment &amp; DC statehood!,2020-04-22 18:37:09,Twitter for iPhone,31,85,covid; 
Discussed holding China accountable for #Covid_19 &amp; bringing manufacturing jobs back to the USA 🇺🇸 on One America News Network @OANN Tipping Point. #KY1 https://t.co/OOSHlstH2H,2020-04-17 19:00:25,Twitter for iPhone,11,44,covid;

China has LIED about #Covid_19 from day one. They have grossly underreported their cases/mortalities &amp; they have not been forthcoming in sharing data that we could use to find a vaccine. That’s why I joined @CongressmanHice in asking @SecPompeo to investigate Chinese propaganda. https://t.co/a3rrTwA9Y8,2020-04-03 17:58:31,Twitter for iPhone,102,198,covid; 
“Help is on the way!” Just spoke in favor of #coronavirusus Stimulus Bill #3 on House Floor.
