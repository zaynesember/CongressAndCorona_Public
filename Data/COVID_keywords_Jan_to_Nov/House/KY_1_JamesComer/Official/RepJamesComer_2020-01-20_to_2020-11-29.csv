For once I agree with @WhipClyburn!   Why do Democrats continue to waste tax dollars on a bogus "Select" Committee that - aside from pointing out @NYGovCuomo's mishandling of COVID-19 - only serves as a political arm of the DCCC to try to smear @realDonaldTrump? https://t.co/0yim71oHAo,2020-10-30 15:50:41,Twitter Web App,22,45,covid;

Glad to join fellow @HouseGOP members this morning to present our #CommitmentToAmerica - a bold agenda to help our nation recover from COVID-19.  Our vision: restore our way of life rebuild our great economy and renew the American Dream. https://t.co/oFMJ5RhmSA,2020-09-15 21:32:53,Twitter for iPhone,216,593,covid; 
Was glad to join my friend and colleague @virginiafoxx in advocating for more flexibility for school nutrition programs. Removing barriers to providing healthy meals for our students is essential as we continue to battle COVID-19. https://t.co/CeERsmrD5i,2020-08-26 17:59:47,Twitter for iPhone,7,19,covid; 
Glad to join members of the @KyChamber to discuss my efforts to boost America’s economic recovery by reining in excessive federal regulations. Input from the business community is critical to overcoming #COVID19. https://t.co/114N8EpiJ8,2020-07-30 20:17:49,Twitter for iPhone,21,44,covid; 
#COVID__19 shut our economy down in the blink of an eye. We must evaluate reforms to red tape that will help strengthen our recovery.  See my letter to the biz community asking for input on how we can build on @realDonaldTrump's historic regulatory relief: https://t.co/dO2M93fCaN,2020-07-17 14:52:35,Twitter Web App,13,27,covid; 
China is attempting to exploit the pandemic by hacking into #Covid_19 research being done by American companies.  We must protect our intellectual property and hold China accountable. https://t.co/4k5BnlgSv7,2020-07-15 19:20:58,Twitter for iPhone,53,94,covid; 
It is disappointing that House Democrats will not investigate the actions of @NYGovCuomo and other Democrat governors who defied federal guidelines and placed COVID-positive patients in nursing homes.  The families who’ve lost loved ones deserve better. https://t.co/XJNVPjdczX,2020-07-13 21:57:41,Twitter for iPhone,1889,4310,covid; 
TONIGHT: Check out my appearance on @FoxNews to discuss misguided proposals from the left to raise taxes on job creators and give China a free pass on #Covid_19. Tune in around 6:25 pm ET/5:25 pm CT https://t.co/pVIYaAyxv4,2020-07-12 21:37:55,Twitter for iPhone,7,21,covid; 
As Governor Cuomo releases flawed data and passes the buck on his own failed policies @SteveScalise is holding his feet to the fire  Readmitting COVID-positive patients into NY nursing homes was a disastrous decision that he must be held accountable for. https://t.co/hCAskBjjXd,2020-07-09 20:32:50,Twitter Web App,313,590,covid; 
The only bombshell discovered in @SpeakerPelosi's new COVID-19 Select Subcommittee has been the malpractice of 5 Democratic governors in managing nursing homes in their states. @SteveScalise does a great job seeking answers for all the families who lost loved ones. ⬇️ https://t.co/APE790F4Le,2020-07-06 21:12:50,Twitter Web App,99,207,covid;
