I support the bipartisan COVID-19 relief plan outlined by the Problem Solvers Caucus as the best path forward to get a deal that meets the needs of the American people.   Details about the plan here: https://t.co/NdYQrzPMBF  #mepolitics #me02politics,2020-10-23 00:10:14,Twitter Web App,3,5,covid; 
State and local funding as a part of COVID-19 relief isn't a partisan issue Dale. If they don't receive federal relief local taxes go up and services like police and schools get cut. #mepolitics #me02debate   https://t.co/8lts53LXMN,2020-10-23 00:08:27,Twitter Web App,1,6,covid; 
On the urgent issues facing our country from COVID-19 relief to economic recovery America needs leaders who work to bring people together and get things done.   That's the record I've earned and the job I'll continue to do.   #mepolitics #me02debate https://t.co/gCpai7qr6M,2020-10-22 01:34:14,Twitter Web App,1,12,covid;

When COVID-19 hit Maine Jared &amp; his team had boots on the ground to help Mainers. The office set up a Small Business Response Team that has helped 100s of small biz navigate relief programs coordinate with federal agencies and connect with resources. #mepolitics #ME02debate 1/,2020-10-15 23:18:38,Twitter Web App,1,7,covid; 
Since March Jared has consistently pushed party leaders to drop the political maneuvering and work together on a deal for add’l COVID-19 relief.   Last month he brought 34 fellow members of the House to put more pressure on Speaker Pelosi: https://t.co/7XrQAwVNBW  #mepolitics,2020-10-15 23:14:55,Twitter Web App,2,9,covid; 
Party leaders think the COVID relief that Mainers are counting on can wait til after the election. They're putting politics over the country's needs &amp; they're not listening to the people.  Jared's working to get both sides to negotiate a bipartisan deal: https://t.co/7XrQAwVNBW,2020-09-23 17:15:48,Twitter Web App,6,24,covid; 
As we all continue to deal with the impacts of the COVID 19 pandemic I wanted to send a special thank you to the educators and parents in Maine who are stepping up all over the state to teach our students from home. #InThisTogether https://t.co/paWbWuV77Z,2020-04-28 16:32:54,TweetDeck,10,32,covid;
