Work sharing programs were a bright spot in the aftermath of the financial crisis and we should immediately reinstate federal support for them in the next coronavirus response package.,2020-03-20 22:31:43,Twitter Web App,0,2,corona; 
Businesses are closing and people are losing their jobs right now because of the coronavirus pandemic. Working people and families are facing an unprecedented threat to their economic security. https://t.co/svsCJfMKLo,2020-03-20 22:31:42,Twitter Web App,1,12,corona; 
The absence of direct funding for programs that millions of people rely on is a mistake that must be fixed. As the debate continues over the third coronavirus response package I will fight to make sure working people and families are put first.,2020-03-20 19:04:14,Twitter Web App,2,13,corona;

That is why Congress has taken swift action on two emergency bills in recent weeks to help our country deal with the coronavirus pandemic and stem its immediate impact on working people families and businesses.,2020-03-18 00:18:10,Twitter Web App,0,3,corona; 
This is a time of crisis. With thousands of positive coronavirus cases across the country and the case count rising exponentially people are rightly concerned. https://t.co/EG3AoBwRe6,2020-03-18 00:16:35,Twitter Media Studio,6,37,corona;

I am disappointed that in Congress’s latest coronavirus response bill the administration has left out tens of millions of workers from access to meaningful paid sick days or longer term paid leave including our frontline health care workers and first responders.,2020-03-17 19:42:57,Twitter Web App,1,11,corona; 
As businesses and schools shut down to prevent the spread of the coronavirus people are fearful of how they and their families are going to make ends meet. Congress has the power to change that—and we should.,2020-03-17 19:42:56,Twitter Web App,0,2,corona; 
Excellent interview with @jkbrennan &amp; @ailsachang on how critical it is to follow @CDCgov and medical professionals’ guidance to avoid catching or spreading the coronavirus.  We have a responsibility to protect others and their families. https://t.co/FiykmK4lGf,2020-03-16 01:49:02,Twitter for iPhone,7,10,corona; 
To help we are providing free testing for coronavirus funding to help stabilize the unemployment insurance system 14 paid sick days for eligible workers as well as 12 weeks of paid leave for longer term care and food assistance.,2020-03-14 17:40:16,Twitter Web App,2,5,corona; 
I am glad that the USDA granted a waiver for Connecticut to ensure kids whose schools are shutting down will continue to have access to school meals. This is critical for keeping kids in low-income families from going hungry during the coronavirus public health emergency.,2020-03-12 22:59:30,Twitter Web App,59,254,corona; 
Proud to have worked with my colleagues @RepKatiePorter &amp; @RepUnderwood to ensure cost is not a barrier for people getting tested for coronavirus. @CDCDirector Redfield must uphold this commitment. https://t.co/hQpTzmyKeq,2020-03-12 18:36:34,Twitter Web App,42,186,corona; 
This bill is directly targeted at helping working people and families affected by the coronavirus pandemic. Proud that it includes paid sick days paid leave food security and free diagnostic testing for all who need it. https://t.co/3cyAfy9gti,2020-03-12 03:38:12,Twitter for iPhone,37,111,corona; 
The coronavirus outbreak is affecting people in the U.S. and around the world—with the first case just reported in South Africa. We must ensure the CDC can help stop the spread of this virus wherever it is. https://t.co/no4ZaitdUa,2020-03-10 16:24:07,Twitter Media Studio,3,13,corona; 
Last week we appropriated $2.2 billion for the CDC to deal with the coronavirus outbreak—much of which will go to state and local health agencies who are on the frontlines dealing with this crisis. https://t.co/iZSwyi4sHi,2020-03-10 15:32:18,Twitter Media Studio,7,18,corona; 
Other countries have been testing thousands of people for weeks. But the U.S. is woefully behind the curve. The low number of positive tests in the U.S. is likely a by-product of under-testing as opposed to an accurate count of the prevalence of coronavirus in the U.S.,2020-03-10 15:29:44,Twitter Web App,2,14,corona; 
The Coronavirus outbreak is a crisis and there are questions about our country's preparedness and ongoing response efforts. I am very concerned about our nation’s testing capabilities for coronavirus. https://t.co/2JYgUoZ98I,2020-03-10 15:29:17,Twitter Media Studio,9,30,corona;

Our federal government must be adequately prepared to deal with and prevent the spread of the coronavirus. That means having robust funding and a detailed plan of action—like President Obama and his administration presented when dealing with Ebola a few years ago. https://t.co/p2JIgYRKon,2020-02-26 17:49:59,Twitter Media Studio,9,17,corona;
