Great to be in Alamogordo this morning — and even better to enjoy the huevos rancheros (with green chile) at Waffle &amp; Pancake Shoppe! As we fight COVID-19 we have to continue to support small businesses and the innovative ways they've found to keep serving their customers. https://t.co/uJwvSMiEVw,2020-10-21 00:14:49,Twitter Web App,9,39,covid; 
COVID-19 has exacerbated the challenges we face when it comes to accessing health care close to home. That's why I fought to include rural providers in COVID-19 relief and why I'll keep fighting for access to health care close to home as we rebuild. https://t.co/8CudMCkIjN,2020-10-19 00:58:51,Twitter Web App,65,149,covid; 
As we face the health &amp; economic crises caused by COVID-19 it's vital we support our workers. That's why I introduced a bill to help workers tackle new challenges like paying for PPE or unexpected child care. In Congress I'll always put New Mexico first. https://t.co/OIK9hAUEp4,2020-10-16 03:47:45,Twitter Web App,18,50,covid; 
I've been ringing the alarm on rural health care since I first got to Congress. As we work to combat COVID-19 I'll continue my fight to make sure all New Mexicans — no matter where they live — have access to affordable health care close to home. https://t.co/qTm0i8zd8v,2020-10-15 02:18:16,Twitter Web App,44,111,covid; 
Cumplir a Nuevo México significa cumplir con nuestra comunidad en estos tiempos difíciles.   Es por es que cuando el Congreso aprobó el plan de ayuda contra la crisis del coronavirus me aseguré de que organizaciones locales recibieran su parte de estos fondos. https://t.co/4MkEiJ8Xjb,2020-10-14 00:06:14,Twitter Web App,20,46,corona; 
COVID upended the supply chain. When restaurants and distributors are closed they don’t buy products like chile — that’s why I fought to get money in the pockets of farmers and small businesses to make payroll and stay afloat. https://t.co/VV511Gj6tl,2020-09-25 02:25:29,Twitter Web App,14,25,covid; 
Had a great time speaking with so many volunteers this morning! While COVID-19 has changed the way we campaign connecting with New Mexicans is still my favorite part — even if it's through a screen. Join us tomorrow for day 2 of our weekend of action → https://t.co/DsARMPUtVx https://t.co/KYbQEWLl4U,2020-09-12 23:53:13,Twitter Web App,13,27,covid; 
It's been a year since I introduced the Rural MOMS Act. COVID-19 has made it more clear that we must continue to fight for access to health care closer to home so all NMans have what they need to start their families — no matter where they choose to do so. https://t.co/V28Sxfc7Y6,2020-09-10 02:51:26,Twitter Web App,5,19,covid;
