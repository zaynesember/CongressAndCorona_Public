Our emergency supplemental bill w/ $8.3 billion was a critical first step but additional action is needed to protect the American people &amp; keep food on the table for families. Enough with the partisanship let's pass the #FamiliesFirst Coronavirus Response Act #ForThePeople!,2020-03-12 19:10:15,Twitter Web App,4,13,corona;

I called for this action last week as #Coronavirus continued to spread globally and I’m happy to see Missouri leading the way. Every state should launch a coronavirus hotline so the American people can get the information they need. https://t.co/6a7YP4CzXI,2020-03-12 18:22:14,Twitter Web App,5,22,corona;

It is absolutely unacceptable for the White House to still be in “concept phase” when it’s been clear for weeks now that #coronavirus was a threat to the public and could seriously hinder the American economy. https://t.co/1eCUnvHpKW,2020-03-10 20:58:11,Twitter Web App,6,28,corona; 
This story is exactly why we need to extend paid sick leave as we seek to deal with #coronavirus. Nearly half of working Americans simply cannot afford to stay home due to illness. Congress must give them that option. https://t.co/YA1ErcZdjZ,2020-03-09 19:50:32,Twitter Web App,8,23,corona;
