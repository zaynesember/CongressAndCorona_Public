Strategic errors &amp; the failure of leadership have impaired our response to the #CoronavirusOutbreak. We need FACTS to understand the scope of this public health crisis.   WATCH: My opening statement during today’s @OversightDems hearing on the Trump Admin’s response to #COVID19. https://t.co/Flw51LrOks,2020-3-11 19:16:59,Twitter Media Studio,85,204,covid; corona; ,,,,
Dr. Fauci is our nation's leading expert on infectious diseases &amp; I'm honored he's testifying at the @OversightDems hearing on the Trump Admin's response to the #CoronavirusOutbreak.   The American people deserve transparency &amp; FACTS about #COVID19.  https://t.co/egc2gydTzp,2020-3-10 19:40:06,Hootsuite Inc.,57,163,covid; corona; ,,,,
Outrageous.   In the midst of the #CoronavirusOutbreak the President is spreading falsehoods &amp; urging the courts to destroy healthcare protections for millions of Americans. Trump cannot dismiss the seriousness of #COVID19 just to preserve his ego.  https://t.co/q9Jk614Nr4,2020-3-10 18:25:05,Hootsuite Inc.,7,15,covid; corona; ,,,,
.@realDonaldTrump not everything is “fake news” or a plot against you. Government agencies must be equipped to manage #COVID19. We need a measured response to stop the spread of the #CoronavirusOutbreak not outbursts and lies from the President.  https://t.co/eP4oRSqpuT,2020-3-9 14:55:39,Twitter Web App,9,20,covid; corona; ,,,,
One of the many reasons why @OversightDems are investigating the Trump Administration’s response to the #CoronavirusOutbreak. Our hospitals &amp; healthcare workers need transparency and FACTS from our gov agencies to prevent the spread of #COVID19. https://t.co/bQ6cbxcgsz,2020-3-7 22:14:04,Twitter for iPhone,13,17,covid; corona; ,,,,
This is grossly irresponsible &amp; riddled with dangerous contradictions and falsehoods. I’ve demanded @HHSgov &amp; @CDCgov provide real info about the spread of #COVID19.   The American people deserve facts not lies from Trump about the #CoronavirusOutbreak. https://t.co/ZMF9bQ14fp,2020-3-5 21:25:25,Twitter Web App,14,29,covid; corona; ,,,,
Thousands of airport workers face potential exposure to #Coronavirus &amp; have no health insurance due to irresponsible contractors that are pushing anti-union tactics designed to limit benefits. NY must pass the #HealthyTerminalsAct to keep these workers &amp; passengers safe. https://t.co/HDxKw3r5AP,2020-3-4 17:50:02,Twitter Web App,15,28,corona; ,,,,
The Trump Administration's response to the #CoronavirusOutbreak has been dysfunctional at best. Yesterday I demanded info from @HHSGov @CDCgov &amp; @US_FDA about testing accuracy diagnoses and cost of treating #COVID19.

The US is one of the only democracies that does not mandate sick leave which could make the spread of the #CoronavirusOutbreak much harder to control. We must guarantee paid medical leave for all Americans.   Our current approach is dangerous.  https://t.co/mqSHTlVqJ9,2020-3-3 18:30:06,Twitter Web App,14,26,corona; ,,,,

STIGMA   There has been a surge in reports of discrimination &amp; violent attacks against Chinese-Americans and individuals of Asian descent. Xenophobia racism and discrimination are never okay.

Trump wouldn’t be hoping for a “miracle” if he had not slashed the CDC budget by almost $700 million in the middle of a pandemic. The Administration’s response shows an ongoing failure to understand urgent public health needs. #Coronavirus  https://t.co/B6XjXvvKTN,2020-2-28 17:45:13,Hootsuite Inc.,12,34,corona; ,,,,
Any vaccine or treatment for the #Coronavirus must be accessible and affordable. We can’t allow the Trump Administration and #BigPharma to prioritize profits over public health.  https://t.co/Le9ILkXKUl,2020-2-27 18:30:04,Twitter Web App,10,19,corona; ,,,,
The worst HIV outbreak in Indiana history happened under Mike Pence's leadership. He has proven he is unable to handle a major public health crisis &amp; his record should be disqualifying.   This decision is irresponsible and dangerous. #Coronavirus https://t.co/n7lBCBvgpd,2020-2-27 17:55:26,Twitter for iPhone,14,22,corona; ,,,,
.@realDonaldTrump let me repeat myself: SCIENCE IS REAL. You can’t close your eyes and pretend that the #coronavirus doesn’t exist. Americans need a coordinated fully-funded response not an Admin that cuts the @CDC budget in the middle of a pandemic. https://t.co/aVOhmWqny6,2020-2-26 19:00:03,Twitter for iPhone,10,27,corona; ,,,,
