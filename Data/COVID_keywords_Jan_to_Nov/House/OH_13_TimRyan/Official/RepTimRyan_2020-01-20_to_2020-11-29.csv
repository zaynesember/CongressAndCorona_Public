Americans can’t afford for us to fall short on my/@RepRoKhanna’s cash infusion plan. As the House negotiates on the next #COVID19 plan let’s keep pushing to get the results working Americans need.

Every American worker impacted by the #COVID19 crisis should be made whole. I'm calling for: 1️⃣ All workers to be able to qualify for unemployment benefits &amp;  2️⃣ For those benefits to cover 100% of lost wages until the job market has rebounded. https://t.co/UdILvIiJ0e,2020-03-22 11:51:00,TweetDeck,27,129,covid; 
We’ve used the Defense Production Act to stoke American manufacturing &amp; beat our enemy in past wars. #COVID19 should be no different. Americans are already dying bc we don’t have enough equipment. Let's start manufacturing supplies we need to save American lives. RT if you agree. https://t.co/AKpU85e6jB,2020-03-21 23:05:57,Twitter Web App,67,97,covid; 
I’m calling on US Treasury to immediately begin issuing war bonds for struggling small businesses. In times of war our government has leveraged resources to keep Americans on solid footing. The #COVID19 crisis necessitates the same level of response. https://t.co/rT9LslrrcY,2020-03-20 16:43:07,Twitter Web App,8,24,covid; 
Many of our friends and neighbors are struggling with basic necessities during the #COVID19 crisis. Please consider donating to your local food banks if you are able. @ACRFoodbank https://t.co/0X9uAKaHrz,2020-03-19 20:41:50,TweetDeck,11,28,covid; 
It’s good the Senate finally passed the Families First Act giving Americans protections during the #COVID19Crisis but this just scratches the surface. Let's think bigger: eg. my/@RepRoKhanna’s cash infusion plan. We need big bold steps to get the American people what they need. https://t.co/NvDPIjZBPx,2020-03-19 16:01:41,Twitter Web App,6,30,covid;

#COVID19 poses a serious risk. The American people are already hurting so let's go big to address the impacts. @RepRoKhanna &amp; I want to bring in big thinkers like @robertwolf32 @Austan_Goolsbee &amp; @jasonfurman to marshal our country’s talent &amp; resources to solve our problems.,2020-03-16 17:33:15,Twitter Web App,13,41,covid; 
Let’s be absolutely clear: the #COVID-19 virus doesn’t discriminate by party. This is not a Democrat or Republican thing. This situation MUST be taken seriously and we are ALL going to have to work together to beat it. https://t.co/Fi6nAcxMV5,2020-03-16 14:26:38,Twitter Web App,12,34,covid;

Late last night I voted for the #FamiliesFirst Act to offer American families strong commonsense protections from coronavirus. This legislation: 💉 Guarantees free testing 👪 Provides paid leave 💵 Supports strong unemployment benefits &amp; 🍲 Expands food assistance.,2020-03-14 10:35:00,TweetDeck,20,158,corona; 
Americans need access to timely accurate testing. It’s the only way we’re going to beat coronavirus.  I’m glad to see @ClevelandClinic is testing in-house. This is a big step forward for us in Ohio. https://t.co/ogBjX4qez2,2020-03-13 14:42:12,TweetDeck,19,58,corona; 
Keeping Americans healthy can't turn into another political football. Here's what I'm doing to protect Northeast Ohioans from #COVID-19 ⬇️ https://t.co/3sBjpq9COG,2020-03-12 20:49:41,Twitter Media Studio,18,87,covid; 
Really appreciate @GovMikeDewine’s leadership on this. There’s nothing political about coronavirus. We must all work together on federal/state/community levels to decrease transmission and protect Ohioans. https://t.co/3UWo0wUswJ,2020-03-12 19:04:35,Twitter for iPhone,13,70,corona;

Any time you have someone like Pence —  who believes in conversion therapy — in charge of science-based tasks like fighting Coronavirus I get a little worried.  My interview today on @smerconish ⬇️ https://t.co/torquhRMRH,2020-02-27 19:59:48,Twitter Media Studio,31,115,corona; 
The spread of #Coronavirus is a timely reminder that we have to proactively protect Americans' health. 80% of US pharmaceuticals are being manufactured overseas in countries like China. We can’t be dependent on foreign nations for lifesaving medicine. ⬇️ https://t.co/RC11STrpiq?,2020-02-26 19:54:56,TweetDeck,18,47,corona; 
It's our government’s job to ensure that we have the tools in place to keep our citizens healthy and safe. We should absolutely be prepared for the possibility that #coronavirus spreads to the United States. https://t.co/j7NNggmLAu,2020-02-25 19:16:19,TweetDeck,11,21,corona;
