It took Senate Republicans 30 days to confirm Justice Amy Coney Barrett. Yet they’ve refused to even consider 2 COVID stimulus packages one that has been sitting in the Senate for 164 days. The American people need relief but Sen. Mitch McConnell doesn’t think it’s a priority.,2020-10-27 00:20:14,Twitter for iPhone,362,1121,covid; 
Sen. Mitch McConnell thinks we shouldn’t pass COVID relief because we’re too close to the election—even though he's rushing to pass a SCOTUS Justice right now.   He's playing political games while families are struggling to put food on the table and keep a roof over their head. https://t.co/AmjggoUAHu,2020-10-09 18:05:59,Twitter for iPhone,11,41,covid;

Hypocrite Sen. Mitch McConnell wants to vote on a SCOTUS Justice within the next 45 days yet he's blocked COVID relief legislation for 127 days.

Early in this crisis the President admitted on tape he knew the coronavirus was deadly but chose to downplay it. Nearly 200000 people have died.

Sen. Mitch McConnell has no problem confirming judges in the Senate but when it comes to bipartisan talks to pass a coronavirus relief package he throws his hands up.  The House passed the #HeroesAct 3 months ago. We’ve been ready to get this done. Let’s go Sen. McConnell. https://t.co/gz8Pr2D6R4,2020-08-13 19:09:49,Twitter for iPhone,22,55,corona;

Just so we’re clear the Administration is holding up the passage of a COVID relief bill because they don’t like the desperately-needed local &amp; state funding. It’s unacceptable.

Long delays supply shortages and a lack of federal coordination are preventing us from getting a handle on the coronavirus.

More than 100000 Americans have died from the coronavirus. 40 million people are unemployed. The American people are demanding justice.   The President just doesn't get it and is making things worse.

The President just doesn't learn. This racist &amp; xenophobic language has no place in our society.
