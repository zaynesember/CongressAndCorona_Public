CA politicians calling for additional restaurant closures and curfews is a sign of weak leadership! When will our local and state officials have the courage to realize lockdowns hurt us more than help us? Open schools open restaurants social distance and take real measures... https://t.co/LP2pqr583C,2020-11-23 00:00:28,Twitter for iPhone,117,534,social distance; 
The folks of #CA25 deserve a Representative who will show up &amp; put their interests first in Washington not a career politician whose focus is political survival. Even through COVID I have not missed a single vote and I will always make the tough decisions not run from them.,2020-10-29 22:41:00,Twitter Web App,16,70,covid; 
(1/2) It is clear that liberal Sacramento policies are hurting Californians but in less than 2 years @ChristyforCA25 has:  🚫 Hiked taxes by $3 billion 🚫 Voted for &amp; still supports jobs-killing #AB5 🚫 Supported defunding police 🚫 Failed to hold an emergency hearing on COVID,2020-10-28 21:11:15,Twitter Web App,45,147,covid; 
We have isolated the problem and its name is Nancy! It’s sickening to watch her hold this nation hostage for political purposes rather than negotiating a final COVID relief package. Please watch this entire video ⬇️  https://t.co/xmpPN41Xuw,2020-10-15 16:37:14,Twitter for iPhone,35,132,covid; 
We need real negotiations for a meaningful COVID package and a separate clean removal of SALT deduction limits ASAP.,2020-09-30 20:20:12,Twitter Web App,18,75,covid; 
Repealing the SALT deduction cap is critical for hardworking Californians but @SpeakerPelosi is playing political games &amp; holding the needed COVID relief hostage with a laundry list of liberal priorities (money for illegals defunding police &amp; releasing more criminals)...,2020-09-30 20:20:12,Twitter Web App,52,152,covid; 
The diligence and ingenuity of the American worker have helped make the US the greatest country in the world. As we grow stronger in our fight against COVID these hardworking men and women are the people who will rebuild our economy and help it reach new heights. #LaborDay https://t.co/6xhjVgHnG1,2020-09-07 21:08:34,Twitter for iPhone,37,146,covid; 
.@ChristyforCA25 and Sacramento liberals keep moving toward the destruction of hundreds of thousands of CA jobs. During #COVID many Californians have turned to rideshare to survive financially or as a safer alternative to public transit. #RepealAB5 now!  https://t.co/FtChZ9Vi2G,2020-08-17 23:01:36,Twitter for iPhone,73,177,covid; 
July has been a busy month in both #CA25 and Washington and as we continue our fight against #COVID19 #TeamGarcia is not slowing down. We are ready to hold #CA25 and stop liberal Sacramento policies from spreading to DC. https://t.co/IPIyBBi3yT,2020-07-31 20:56:45,Twitter for iPhone,56,189,covid; 
In just 4 months Vote Centers will be opening for the November election. Last month #TeamGarcia showed the nation the power of a grassroots movement even during the #COVID19 stay-at-home orders. Let's keep pushing to stop liberal Sacramento policies from spreading to DC!,2020-06-24 23:11:47,Twitter for iPhone,219,803,covid;

Today marks the 75th anniversary of the surrender of the Nazi regime in 1945. This reminder of the will of the American people in the face of overwhelming adversity is especially inspiring today as we fight #COVID19.

.@ChristyforCA25 and Sacramento Dems gave us #AB5 which was destroying jobs before #COVID19 and now they want taxpayer dollars to ratchet up enforcement even tighter on our gig economy. Drop this lawsuit now and stop driving jobs out of California!  https://t.co/X8UkJvWdZO,2020-05-06 18:04:18,Twitter Web App,105,178,covid; 
Nurses are there for us during the most stressful times in our lives and during this #COVID19 pandemic they've risked their own lives to care for others. I'd like to express my gratitude for their bravery and sacrifice especially during this turbulent time. #NationalNursesDay https://t.co/VovIqwJPZo,2020-05-06 14:50:37,Twitter Web App,53,123,covid; 
Leave it to a pandemic called Corona to put a damper on #CincoDeMayo! I am a proud first-generation American whose father immigrated here legally from Mexico so I believe it is important to honor and celebrate Mexican heritage and culture here in #CA25. ¡Feliz Cinco de Mayo!,2020-05-05 19:42:37,Twitter Web App,58,218,corona; 
#COVID Relief Phase 3.5 passed in the House today and is headed to the President's desk. This relief package will replenish funds for small businesses and their employees but banks need to focus on lower value loans to keep local businesses afloat. https://t.co/AkoxyzXzUv,2020-04-24 01:00:53,Twitter Web App,28,40,covid; 
1/The desperately needed new wave of #COVID19 relief funding is making its way through Congress. This will help small businesses and their employees in #CA25 but only if local banks commit to helping the very small businesses in our District. https://t.co/EEhNnJHBp2,2020-04-22 22:20:51,Twitter Web App,22,41,covid; 
Not only do Californians have to worry about #COVID19 high taxes and job-killing policies but criminals (including child abusers) are now being released on zero bail. @GavinNewsom rescind the $0 cash bail mandate now to protect our children and families. https://t.co/ZQsdFLGS34,2020-04-22 19:17:46,Twitter Web App,41,66,covid; 
I am so proud of #TeamGarcia's response to the #COVID19 pandemic in #CA25. While @ChristyforCA25 ignores her responsibilities as Chair of the CA Committee on Emergency Management we have been working to make sure our community receives the resources they need during this crisis. https://t.co/z0PyZ7jWqA,2020-04-17 00:12:07,Twitter Web App,61,106,covid;

The importance of our healthcare professionals cannot be overstated as we continue to fight #COVID19. They go into work everyday and risk their own health to treat those in need. Thank you and we are praying for you! #WorldHealthDay,2020-04-07 18:45:51,Twitter for Android,14,40,covid;

Last night's virtual town hall was a great opportunity to connect with the people of the Antelope Valley. The #COVID19 pandemic presents a unique set of challenges but we will continue to share our message with the folks of #CA25.

As the nation looks to contain #coronavirus Pelosi looks to spread the cancers of CA to the national level. Among several unrelated items she’s calling for a no-ID law for voting around the nation in the #COVID19 relief bill. I’m running to prevent my nation from becoming CA! https://t.co/xMu1yUqhXM,2020-03-24 20:55:42,Twitter Web App,25,50,covid; corona; 
3/ The beautiful irony in this is that the quickest path to recovery is for all of us to spend more time at home as a family unit. As someone who has seen the dark side of humanity in combat I assure you there are far worse places to be. #FlattenTheCurve #COVID19 #Coronavirus,2020-03-21 00:32:32,Twitter Web App,11,24,covid; corona; 
Great conversation last night on our virtual town hall with the fine folks in Simi Valley. We covered a lot of issues from the #Coronavirus to how we can lower taxes and improve our economy.

This video from Dr. Aakash is one of the best explanations of COVID-19 and flattening of the curve I've seen. It is extremely important that we listen to the experts and follow their advice.
