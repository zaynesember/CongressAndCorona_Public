The @nytimes estimates @realDonaldTrump's #COVID19 care would cost more than $100000. Not many Americans could afford such a bill &amp; there are cases of bills of $400000.

Today instead of taking up either of the two #COVID relief bills the House has passed the Senate is rushing a vote to confirm a #SCOTUS seat.
