Some good news - immigrants in cities like NYC won’t be pushed into crowded situations during the outbreak potentially causing #coronavirus spread. I called for this previously. Still should be national. My thanks to @RepJerryNadler &amp; @NYCCouncil38 for working with me on this. https://t.co/KDmUNAmjDS,2020-03-14 04:35:37,Twitter for iPhone,53,183,corona; 
We continue getting troubling reports of immigrants being required to report to crowded courts for proceedings.

@realDonaldTrump care to explain how the coronavirus “will go away” when we cannot reliably provide tests to symptomatic individuals? #WhereAreTheTests that Australia and South Korea have made readily accessible to their citizens?  https://t.co/jw7mGTrQiN,2020-03-13 21:30:00,TweetDeck,1,7,corona; 
@realDonaldTrump promised accessible #coronavirus testing so why do we fall short ofSouth Korea and Australia in kit availability and responsiveness.

The @US_FDA gave approval for faster automated #coronavirus testing to increase patient outreach tenfold.   While helpful these measures should have been taken weeks ago.
