I ran for Senate because I was sick and tired of watching the Senate GOP fight to make life harder for working people.  COVID-19 has shown how important it is for every family to have high-quality affordable health care.

As COVID-19 cases rise we all must work to keep our communities safe.  I'm glad to have secured more than $15.5 million to fund PPE and critical medical supplies &amp; increase medical staffing.

President Trump's COVID-19 response left families struggling and our economy shattered.  His health care plan would end protections for pre-existing conditions and make insurance unaffordable during a pandemic.

Instead of voting on a #COVID19 relief package to help working families Senate Republicans are holding the second day of hearings for a #SCOTUS nominee who would strip health care from 245000 New Mexicans.
