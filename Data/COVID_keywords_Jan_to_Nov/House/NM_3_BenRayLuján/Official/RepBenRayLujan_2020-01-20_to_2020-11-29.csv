Inaction in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic will cost lives and hamper our economic recovery – and it’s exactly why the House passed the #HeroesAct to support workers bolster testing and provide aid to local state and Tribal governments.  https://t.co/ZPY8OyoPoW,2020-05-16 03:02:53,Twitter for iPhone,4,8,covid;
