Dems are telling Americans that the GOP support a tax code that favors the “rich”. False. We support low taxes for all. The Dem Covid-19 package they just voted for repeals the SALT deduction cap the GOP put in place in 2017. The result: a huge tax cut for the “rich”.

We cannot slow the spread of COVID-19 if Americans have to continue to wait nearly 5 days to receive their test results.

California Dems are releasing 8K prison inmates due to Covid 19 concerns. And now Dems and the media are losing their minds because @realDonaldTrump commuted Stone’s sentence which was the result of a politically motivated attack on the President?

While Speaker Pelosi has kept the House of Rep. from coming back to work she has crafted a Socialist wish list piece of legislation.

For weeks the media/Dems criticized @realDonaldTrump saying he doesn’t have a “National” plan for Covid 19 (he does through CDC FDA NIH etc.) Now that he is developing an economic “reopening” plan they say he doesn’t have the authority to tell states what to do!
