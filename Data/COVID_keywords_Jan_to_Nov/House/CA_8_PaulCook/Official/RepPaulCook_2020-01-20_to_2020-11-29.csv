FEMA grants have been made available to help American families and individuals struggling with lost wages due to COVID-19. As the pandemic continues I call on Gov. Newsom to act swiftly in securing this critical assistance for the State of California. https://t.co/o5UM3fpwEL,2020-08-21 20:19:54,Twitter for iPhone,4,7,covid; 
We’re making progress in combatting COVID-19 but HR 6800 wastes precious time and money. Instead of working together to help American families &amp; small businesses the House majority put forward an unfocused partisan bill that has no chance of becoming law https://t.co/XeQJ9WK9oC,2020-05-16 02:03:12,Twitter for iPhone,3,7,covid; 
My colleagues and I sent a letter to Gov. Gavin Newsom. Congress intended for the COVID-19 funds provided to the State of California to be passed down in part to areas that didn’t receive money directly not for the money to remain idle in Sacramento. https://t.co/ZbiftSm8eL,2020-05-06 21:37:11,Twitter for iPhone,8,16,covid; 
My colleagues and I sent a letter to Congressional leaders addressing the lack of COVID-19 funds for small/midsize counties including @InyoCounty and @CountyofMono. We need to ensure ALL our counties have adequate resources. https://t.co/gHuG4YemBX,2020-05-04 23:33:19,Twitter for iPhone,3,11,covid;
