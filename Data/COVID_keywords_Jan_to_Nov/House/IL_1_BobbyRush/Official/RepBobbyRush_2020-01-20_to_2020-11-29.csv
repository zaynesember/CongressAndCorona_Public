@BillyReedPoet Thank you for your question Billy. The answer is absolutely not.

The @CDCgov says contact tracing is a “core disease control measure” &amp; “key strategy for preventing further spread of COVID-19.”  The COVID-19 TRACE Act would allow for mobile testing &amp; door-to-door outreach to ensure we can SAFELY get back to normal. https://t.co/YlYhCQA5rR,2020-05-09 21:34:19,Twitter for iPhone,13,13,covid; 
Rep. Underwood is right. That is why I encourage all members to support my bill the COVID-19 TRACE Act which would create a $100 BILLION grant program for local organizations to hire train and pay individuals to operate mobile testing units and conduct contact tracing. https://t.co/AbhvrGcAwe,2020-05-09 18:36:46,Twitter for iPhone,8,21,covid; 
Thank you @ASlavitt.  The COVID-19 TRACE Act would provide $100 BILLION in grants for local organizations to hire train and pay individuals to run mobile testing units and conduct much needed contact tracing. I encourage more of my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation. https://t.co/JFULBO8Y8s,2020-05-08 17:02:17,Twitter for iPhone,8,19,covid; 
This thread shows why we need mobile testing and door-to-door outreach if we are going to be able to test a significant portion of the population.  My bill the COVID-19 TRACE Act creates a $100 billion grant program to ramp up mobile testing and contact tracing. https://t.co/CWLMbu3KQO,2020-05-08 13:28:03,Twitter for iPhone,11,26,covid; 
Absolutely. My bill the COVID-19 TRACE Act (H.R. 6666) would create a $100 BILLION grant program for local organizations to hire train and pay individuals to operate mobile testing units and conduct contact tracing in hot spots and medically underserved areas. https://t.co/5YGK34ifsU,2020-05-05 20:25:44,Twitter for iPhone,237,297,covid; 
This is exactly why we need widespread nationwide testing AND contact tracing. My bill the COVID-19 TRACE Act (H.R. 6666) provides $100 billion dollars in grant funding for both. https://t.co/CQayarI6r9,2020-05-04 20:47:16,Twitter for iPhone,3,24,covid; 
I agree. My bill the COVID-19 TRACE Act (H.R. 6666) would create a $100 billion grant program to locally hire individuals in order to fully mobilize our contact tracing efforts.  Widespread testing and contact tracing is the only way to safely reopen the economy. https://t.co/c9HB1GgEMc,2020-05-03 18:12:52,Twitter for iPhone,14,27,covid; 
I am glad to see DOJ is finally releasing prisoners in response to this pandemic which I have been calling on them to do since March.  Still I remain concerned that DOJ/BOP is not moving fast enough as demonstrated by the explosion of COVID-19 cases inside federal prisons. https://t.co/wuqekoRBPG,2020-05-01 21:22:12,Twitter for iPhone,1,7,covid; 
Just finished an E&amp;C briefing w/ CDC regarding racial disparities &amp; COVID-19 which I have been calling for since late last month.

Exactly. We need nationwide testing AND Contact Tracing if we are going to return to normal.  My bill the COVID-19 TRACE Act would establish a $100 Billion grant program to fully mobilize coronavirus testing and contact tracing efforts. https://t.co/ETuSaYBKMe,2020-05-01 19:36:19,Twitter for iPhone,6,13,covid; corona; 
Reopening our economy will be all but impossible if we do not increase testing and implement widespread contact tracing.  Today I introduced the COVID-19 TRACE Act which provides $100 Billion to fund the contact tracing we need to get back to normal. https://t.co/YlYhCQA5rR,2020-05-01 18:56:04,Twitter Web App,71,167,covid;

Two days after the first COVID-19 case was confirmed in the U.S. @realDonaldTrump said he wasn't worried about a pandemic and that he had the situation "totally under control."

I truly cannot fathom why so many would risk their own lives—and the lives of others—for what appears to be an exceptionally terrible party.

For the 2018–19 flu season @CDCgov estimates that influenza killed 34k Americans.  COVID-19 has so far killed over 50k Americans &amp; the head of CDC predicts it will be back this fall with a vengeance.

I was proud to cosponsor this bill and thank you for leading the charge!   The $1200 stimulus check that many of my constituents are receiving this week is a good start but as Rep.

It's already terrible that inmates must pay up to $25 to call a family member or loved one. But at a time when COVID-19 cases are spiking inside prisons it's unconscionable.

On March 6 we were at 14 deaths nationwide due to COVID-19. Today over 20000 Americans have died as a result of this disease.
