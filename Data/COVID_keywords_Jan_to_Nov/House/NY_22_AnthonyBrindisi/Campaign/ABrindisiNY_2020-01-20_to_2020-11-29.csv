First @claudiatenney deleted her tweet saying 200000 COVID deaths was a Democratic talking point and that only 6% of those deaths were caused by COVID https://t.co/bQ9dOuUU0I,2020-10-22 21:13:27,Twitter Web App,0,4,covid; 
BREAKING: U.S. Senate Leader Mitch McConnell KEEPS standing in the way of a serious comprehensive COVID response locally.   He is STILL blocking the White House effort to get a deal.   So just who will defend him? ... @claudiatenney OF COURSE https://t.co/NKuG2YJNsc,2020-10-21 21:12:27,Twitter for iPhone,5,25,covid; 
The record is clear for #Qlaudia:  Denying the COVID death count...  Following more than 200 QAnon accounts on Twitter…  #NY22 deserves the truth and the facts not @claudiatenney's wild conspiracies from the dark corners of the Internet!  https://t.co/ohHn1W1vtE,2020-10-21 20:40:49,Twitter Web App,17,55,covid; 
During this pandemic I put politics aside &amp; sent bipartisan COVID relief bills to the President's desk. We need another one. I am pushing Washington to get its act together and get something done. While @ClaudiaTenney is pushing conspiracy theories I am pushing solutions. https://t.co/BEQVP6CBJB,2020-10-20 00:16:44,Twitter Web App,15,52,covid; 
Over 200000 lives lost in America due to COVID but @ClaudiaTenney believes otherwise! She deleted the tweet but she can’t hide from us. #Qlaudia must take off her tin foil hat and acknowledge what we’re up against and the tragic losses we’ve suffered so far. https://t.co/86WmXK6IHg,2020-10-17 19:14:04,Twitter Web App,37,144,covid; 
SUPER-SPREADER: #Qlaudia Tenney is a super-spreader of conspiracies.   @claudiatenney actually says people aren’t dying from COVID. No it’s actually a “car accident.”  WHAT?! WHAT?! WHAT?! 🤯  https://t.co/r1uzsX4qyS,2020-10-16 10:38:49,Twitter for iPhone,46,104,covid; 
Upstate we must stay diligent in our fight against COVID. I’m sure we all see the reports about test positivity rates creeping up. Make sure to mask up wash your hands and socially distance! https://t.co/oonQxP5oC9,2020-10-09 15:09:26,Twitter Web App,19,54,covid; 
THERE SHE GOES AGAIN: With over 200 thousand lives lost in the USA @claudiatenney has resorted to conspiracy theories about coronavirus.  I challenge Ms. Tenney to do more than delete tin foil hat tweets after she’s been caught.  She MUST acknowledge the lives lost—some local. https://t.co/Y5cejcdSnD,2020-10-05 13:36:06,Twitter Web App,64,220,corona; 
I spoke with the @UticaOD about my plans for a second term. Here’s just a few highlights of how I’ll help Upstate and America:  ✅ Deliver COVID relief 🥊 Hold Spectrum accountable 🇺🇸 Heal our divisions  #NY22 if we work together we can get it done!  https://t.co/dXvdoinyGn,2020-09-24 14:51:56,Twitter Web App,7,24,covid;

The initial plan of the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program (CFAP) did not provide enough support for New York’s producers. We fixed that. Now we’re fighting for more.  https://t.co/CgspcczMLU,2020-08-31 18:46:22,Twitter Web App,2,11,corona; 
ICYMI I wrote an op-ed blowing the whistle on Spectrum’s plan to cap your Internet data. Their greed is unacceptable even more so during the coronavirus crisis when so many have had to cut back. #NY22 we must fight this.  https://t.co/GkiMHrbZvD,2020-08-16 20:39:40,Twitter for iPhone,10,22,corona; 
Our #NY22 farmers are the backbone of our country’s economy and food security. Like so many of our small businesses and workers they have been greatly hurt by the coronavirus pandemic.   Washington needs to put politics aside and get Americans the help they need! https://t.co/uxHV7CsqDQ,2020-08-16 13:21:04,Twitter for iPhone,12,51,corona; 
The House worked to solve this very problem in the recent bipartisan coronavirus relief bill I supported but if the FCC says it is ‘OK’ for Spectrum now we’re all in trouble.,2020-08-12 15:41:46,Twitter Web App,1,5,corona;

I’m calling on President Trump to declare NY state a disaster area freeing up more federal money and resources to fight Coronavirus.
