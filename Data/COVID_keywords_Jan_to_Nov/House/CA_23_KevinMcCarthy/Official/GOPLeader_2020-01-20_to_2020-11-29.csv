America is the best-prepared nation on earth to deal with the coronavirus.   As a country we've made smart moves early—including boosting rapid response funding and stopping travel from China—and now we're all working together to stay prepared. https://t.co/hQMDWCcs0A,2020-03-06 13:07:05,Twitter Media Studio,2421,8561,corona;

BREAKING 🚨 Congress just passed important coronavirus funding that will: ✓ Speed the development of vaccines ✓ Increase access to testing and treatments ✓ Expand access to telemedicine services so more people can see their doctor remotely  Next stop ➟ President Trump's desk.,2020-03-05 19:22:43,Twitter Web App,1347,4685,corona; 
@RachelBitecofer @billmaher I'm still at the office on a conference call about coronavirus so not sure who is sitting in front of you. But have a safe flight! https://t.co/y4MIqfMGwD,2020-03-05 17:47:36,Twitter Web App,3,46,corona; 
Some issues should be completely immune to partisan differences and containing the coronavirus is certainly one of them. https://t.co/xsOwZs88ZI,2020-03-05 16:53:36,Twitter for iPhone,394,1361,corona; 
Dems delayed on acting on the coronavirus. Instead they ran ads against Repubs and tried to sneak in provisions that would've delayed vaccine development.  Now days later we're finally moving ahead to protect Americans. News conference starts soon:  https://t.co/5zXyrKoIWP,2020-03-05 16:24:45,Twitter Web App,4408,11974,corona; 
The coronavirus doesn't care whether you are a Democrat or a Republican.   All that matters is the health and safety of American citizens. Glad that Democrats dropped the political games so we could pass the clean funding bill needed to protect Americans.,2020-03-04 21:58:23,Twitter for iPhone,2091,8918,corona; 
BIG thank you to @RepKayGranger and @NitaLowey for working so hard to write a CLEAN common-sense funding bill to combat the coronavirus. https://t.co/XW6fmxCIkm,2020-03-04 21:03:24,Twitter Web App,220,863,corona; 
Thank you @VP Pence for leading the charge against coronavirus in the U.S. Today’s visit with you and Dr. Fauci was very helpful for @HouseGOP as we are poised to pass the funding needed to contain and treat #COVID19. https://t.co/NjntQFxWIq,2020-03-04 20:18:28,Twitter Web App,368,1272,covid; corona; 
Congress should've already passed a funding bill to combat coronavirus. Period. But Democrats are hellbent on sneaking in elements of their liberal agenda—which would slow down vaccine development and availability.  We need CLEAN funding. No gimmicks. No new strings attached.,2020-03-04 16:11:17,Twitter Web App,10882,27855,corona; 
The United States has never been better prepared to deal with an infectious disease like the coronavirus. Under Republicans funding went UP for: ⬆️ @NIH - 39% ⬆️ @CDCgov - 24% ⬆️ Infectious Disease Response - 70% https://t.co/q3IVC2klhe,2020-03-03 22:27:01,Twitter Web App,6400,19223,corona; 
What a scam—Speaker Pelosi held up the vote on coronavirus funding so that her campaign team could run ads against Republicans for Super Tuesday.  Instead of putting America first she is putting politics first. https://t.co/ws0nn0hUXP,2020-03-03 19:32:01,Twitter Media Studio,19244,39092,corona; 
Congress could have passed new funding to fight the coronavirus last week. But what did Speaker Pelosi decide to do instead? Run coronavirus campaign ads against Republicans.  This is petty politics at its worst. She owes the American public an apology. https://t.co/dZlZ2vqIG3,2020-03-03 18:08:15,Twitter Media Studio - LiveCut,11909,23713,corona; 
Our number one priority is keeping Americans safe.  We'll be talking about the latest developments to prepare against coronavirus at @HouseGOP's news conference with @SteveScalise @RepLizCheney and @RepGregWalden of @HouseCommerce.  Starting at 10am ET. https://t.co/Pk4jPUtJIS,2020-03-03 14:33:23,Twitter Web App,229,936,corona; 
Great move by @US_FDA to clear red tape and immediately expand testing of coronavirus in U.S. hospital labs. This substantially increases testing capabilities across the country. https://t.co/LqYXOpatmK,2020-03-01 18:53:58,Twitter for iPhone,932,3170,corona; 
Very supportive of the travel ban from Iran as well as new restrictions to affected areas of South Korea and Italy. Though the risk remains small for Americans the US government is taking every possible precaution to keep Americans safe against the Chinese coronavirus.,2020-03-01 13:30:28,Twitter for iPhone,4206,15585,corona; 
Good news: according to the CDC coronavirus test kits are expected to be available in every state and local health department across the U.S. by next week. https://t.co/rF6z8NuyQk,2020-02-29 00:11:46,Twitter for iPhone,1291,3964,corona; 
Closely monitoring the coronavirus situation on the West Coast. My office is in constant contact with @lapublichealth local officials &amp; the @WhiteHouse. I'm committed to ensuring the safety of my constituents Californians and Americans everywhere.,2020-02-27 22:33:04,Twitter Web App,684,2572,corona; 
Excellent pick from @VP Pence. Ambassador Debbie Birx is an expert in public health and in her new role as @WhiteHouse Coronavirus Response Coordinator she will bolster the coordinated decisive steps our government is taking to keep Americans safe.,2020-02-27 18:23:36,Twitter Web App,1158,3875,corona; 
To my colleagues on the other side who are attempting to seize this global coronavirus epidemic as a political moment—I say STOP IT. https://t.co/SzjrtScYo9,2020-02-27 16:50:43,Twitter for iPhone,1615,4539,corona; 
As #COVID19 spreads America continues to play a crucial role in the global effort to contain and cure this disease.  Today I sat down with Deputy Secretary of @StateDept Stephen Biegun to discuss our robust efforts in battling this virus with our allies around the world. https://t.co/uAwfI4TWrL,2020-02-26 21:55:48,Twitter Media Studio,178,611,covid; 
To keep Americans safe from coronavirus: ✔️ Congress has been reinforcing infectious disease readiness for years. ✔️ President Trump has taken preemptive measures like travel restrictions and quarantines. ✖️ Senator Schumer put out a press release. https://t.co/bIOL1xlq3w,2020-02-26 18:58:11,Twitter for iPhone,1306,3099,corona; 
Most members of Congress are working closely with the White House to keep Americans safe and prepare against any potential spreading of the coronavirus.  Senator Schumer—this is NOT a time to play politics.,2020-02-26 16:34:52,Twitter Web App,4890,16432,corona;
