The American economy led by @realDonaldTrump is roaring back! GDP grew at a 33.1% annual rate over the last quarter shattering expectations &amp; pointing to a strong recovery from COVID-19 shutdowns.

Great decision! The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the important and often dangerous work of our National Guard servicemembers. Extending the federal activation to over 90 days will give these heroes the benefits they deserve for their work during this challenging time. https://t.co/fIwhu7hbxz,2020-05-28 16:31:21,Twitter for iPhone,3,14,covid; 
That's why I'm an original cosponsor of the COVID-19 Accountability Act which would grant authority to the president to place sanctions on the Chinese Communist Party if they do not cooperate with an investigation into the origins of the COVID19 outbreak. https://t.co/p2Eti8U2Y2,2020-05-27 13:52:43,Twitter Web App,0,3,covid; 
The Chinese Communist Party must be held accountable for their #coronavirus cover-up. For months they hid data silenced scientists &amp; healthcare professionals &amp; limited information to the rest of the world. They are directly responsible for the nearly 100000 deaths in the U.S.,2020-05-27 13:52:42,Twitter Web App,9,45,corona; 
I recently joined @CityofJax Council &amp; was asked if I support added funding for localities to respond to coronavirus costs. My answer is yes! I don't however support using NE FL tax dollars to pay off debts incurred by cities &amp; states long before the coronavirus pandemic. https://t.co/Kelp5KRv9O,2020-05-18 22:48:57,Twitter Web App,8,53,corona; 
I support additional #coronavirus relief.   I do not support federalizing the elections process.  I do not support the early release of criminals.  I do not support incentives for illegal immigration.   We can do this in a bipartisan way – but this isn’t it. https://t.co/zkPYHoXCZL,2020-05-15 21:21:44,Twitter Web App,79,273,corona;

I was proud to join @RepMarkTakano in urging the White House Coronavirus Task Force to include sign language interpreters at their briefings.

Florida is expected to receive over $8 billion to support our relief efforts. It is crucial that state local and federal leaders work together to ensure this funding quickly gets to our communities in Northeast Florida. #coronavirus,2020-04-28 15:05:16,Twitter Web App,1,7,corona;

Register below for our conversation on #COVIDー19! https://t.co/FmBPRSNcBl,2020-04-02 13:58:46,Twitter Web App,3,15,covid; 
1) I appreciated the opportunity to present an update on the federal response to #COVIDー19 to the St. Johns County Board of County Commissioners. Specifically we focused on how the recently passed CARES Act will provide assistance to struggling families and small businesses.,2020-04-01 16:57:49,Twitter Web App,3,7,covid;

America is resilient in times of crisis – today’s challenges are no exception. The CARES Act will deliver immediate assistance to health care heroes on the front lines &amp; support individual workers &amp; small businesses negatively impacted by the #coronavirus. https://t.co/rss0BcQJvj,2020-03-27 17:50:23,Twitter Web App,7,14,corona; 
Thank you @realDonaldTrump for acting quickly to approve a Major Disaster Declaration for the State of Florida. This will give local governments and individual Floridians access to more emergency resources as we work together to defeat the #coronavirus and revive our economy. https://t.co/lUwesWJfv5,2020-03-25 19:31:10,Twitter Web App,1,20,corona; 
The governor also announced bans on gatherings of over 10 people and urged all non-essential businesses to have at least 50% of their employees telecommute. #coronavirus,2020-03-25 00:27:07,Twitter Web App,1,4,corona; 
.@GovRonDeSantis is urging all Florida residents aged 65 and over to stay home for the next 14 days. For those not affected by this advisory consider helping our neighbors who may need assistance gathering groceries or supplies during these next two weeks. #coronavirus,2020-03-25 00:27:07,Twitter Web App,11,33,corona; 
.@SpeakerPelosi is also pushing for a government buyout of commercial aircraft. This is an aviation version of "Cash for Clunkers." What does this have to do with mitigating the damage caused by #COVIDー19? https://t.co/sNDRqeInaf,2020-03-23 21:36:04,Twitter Web App,28,40,covid; 
.@SpeakerPelosi is slipping in mandatory same-day voter registration for all states. It’s not only for the November election but for “any subsequent election for federal office.” This has NOTHING to do with giving workers relief during the coronavirus outbreak. https://t.co/yFKqyw4oWJ,2020-03-23 21:36:03,Twitter Web App,35,44,corona; 
.@SpeakerPelosi is using the coronavirus crisis to sneak in elements of the #GreenNewDeal. Our responsibility to American families hurting right now has nothing to do with carbon emissions! https://t.co/pUSnl30HwL,2020-03-23 21:36:03,Twitter Web App,53,57,corona; 
Our outstanding health care workers on the front lines of the #COVIDー19 pandemic deserve a huge THANK YOU!

Disappointing to see @SenSchumer leading the Democrats to vote down a bipartisan #coronavirus relief package yesterday.

2/ That's why I introduced the bipartisan Coronavirus Worker Relief Act.
