Since COVID-19 hit nearly 30% of Vermonters have experienced food insecurity.   The CARES Act played a big role in helping feed the hungry—but the hunger relief programs expire next month. We must pass another COVID-19 relief package NOW.,2020-11-28 15:00:14,Falcon Social Media Management ,2,6,covid; 
Sending encouragement to all Vermonters as we battle COVID-19 during the holiday season.  I know it’s isolating to be apart from friends &amp; family right now. But we will get through this together—just like we did at the start of this pandemic. Stay strong!,2020-11-22 17:00:02,Falcon Social Media Management ,1,2,covid; 
A huge thank you to the food security advocates at @HungerFreeVT.  The CARES Act was critical to hunger relief during COVID-19 but that’s set to expire next month. We urgently need another stimulus package.  https://t.co/YGBmlizvOO,2020-11-21 23:30:01,Falcon Social Media Management ,2,1,covid; 
While uncertainty continues to brew here’s one thing I know:   House Democrats are doing everything we can to get COVID-19 relief to American individuals families &amp; small businesses who need help right now.   https://t.co/7r8vaApKBM,2020-11-17 15:00:11,Falcon Social Media Management ,1,2,covid; 
Big thank you to @gracepotter for joining me in support of #SaveOurStages!  Too many independent venues have shut down since COVID-19 struck. This bill provides an economic lifeline to them—with most funds going right back to our community members.   https://t.co/PoMBsVX8HG,2020-11-13 17:00:17,Falcon Social Media Management ,1,4,covid; 
I’m pleased to see the President-elect make controlling COVID-19 an immediate priority &amp; to lead with science in doing so.  A robust public health response—one that looks out for all Americans—will save countless lives and defeat this pandemic for good.  https://t.co/NAFAMq9ReW,2020-11-12 19:00:12,Falcon Social Media Management ,1,0,covid;

Any Dave Matthews fans around here? 🤚  This weekend Peter will be watching him + other inspiring artists play at the virtual #SOSFest in support of #SaveOurStages.  It’s critical that our local music venues get the support they need during COVID-19.  https://t.co/6QInyH8GEK,2020-10-17 00:00:01,Falcon Social Media Management ,2,6,covid;

Big thanks to Jack Hedges and all of our front line providers in VT who have administered nearly 170k COVID-19 tests. Jack gave Peter a COVID-19 test at the end of last week which came back negative after he (safely) traveled to DC.   Vermonters stay safe and wear a mask! https://t.co/icqpbPfSul,2020-10-11 22:30:02,Falcon Social Media Management ,1,2,covid; 
Americans need relief NOW in the wake of Trump’s reckless + botched covid response.   But Trump is holding economic aid hostage until after the election. This means individuals families small businesses and schools will suffer.  It is unconscionable.  https://t.co/o64flLux7O,2020-10-06 21:00:59,Falcon Social Media Management ,1,0,covid; 
“Vermont businesses needed help in May and they need it even more today.”  Last week Peter voted in favor of the updated #HEROESAct. The Senate has failed to act on robust COVID-19 relief for months but Vermonters + small businesses need relief now.   https://t.co/qaHUrPofEl,2020-10-05 16:00:14,Falcon Social Media Management ,1,0,covid; 
Independent music venues are hurting b/c of Covid.   According to @nivassoc 90% of its members may have to close their doors w/o government assistance. We need the #SaveOurStages Act now!

“Please you’ve done so well don’t let your guard down.”   This week Dr. Anthony Fauci said he wishes he “could bottle” Vermont’s COVID-19 response and implement it all over the US.   Keep it up Vermonters!   https://t.co/q29QgnokcK,2020-09-18 19:45:01,Falcon Social Media Management ,1,2,covid;

The President's ineptitude and refusal to seriously address the coronavirus pandemic has already resulted in over 134k American deaths. This is unacceptable. When will the President wake up? We need a comprehensive federal plan NOW to slow the spread of Covid-19.,2020-07-09 21:07:20,Twitter Web App,0,0,covid; corona; 
Yesterday I voted in support of the #MovingForward Act the House infrastructure package that would create millions of much needed jobs.
