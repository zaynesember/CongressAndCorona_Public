Last night with my support the House passed an updated Heroes Act to deliver much needed Covid aid to communities across the country. In addition to the critical help for individuals and families the bill includes my RESTAURANTS Act and SOS Act. #vtpoli,2020-10-02 17:44:55,Twitter Web App,6,47,covid;

Today I’m back in DC to pass an updated Heroes Act. It includes badly need Covid relief including more than $15 billion in emergency broadband funding for families &amp; students to make sure that they can connect for school work &amp; doctors appointments. https://t.co/auCim2O4VJ,2020-09-29 14:36:09,TweetDeck,8,39,covid; 
Proud to have voted last night for this deal to keep the government open stop USCIS furloughs and boost #3SquaresVT. We have more work to do in December and still badly need a Covid relief package but this deal avoids a shutdown now. #vtpoli https://t.co/9TTTkrmfRk,2020-09-23 17:14:33,Twitter Web App,6,15,covid; 
.@realdonaldtrump knew how bad COVID was and lied about it. Now the Senate GOP refuses to pass aid to help Americans suffering from those lies. This is a historic failure of leadership. https://t.co/t32AVoAGll,2020-09-09 18:51:51,Twitter Web App,34,75,covid;

Transparency &amp; oversight are crucial to good government. @RepKatiePorter &amp; I sent a letter to @SecAzar asking how more than $6.6b in taxpayer $ going to private pharma companies through ‘Operation Warp Speed’ will support development of an affordable vaccine for COVID-19. https://t.co/W8edz4qZLC,2020-07-23 21:52:48,Twitter Web App,115,251,covid; 
It is dangerous and ignorant for the president to try and block money for coronavirus testing and contact tracing. The health and safety of Americans should never be a partisan issue. https://t.co/iAFAmAJDDz,2020-07-18 23:47:39,Twitter for iPhone,9,71,corona;

Only the federal government has the resources to craft a nationwide testing tracing and quarantine strategy to stop the #COVID19 pandemic.

Big Pharma never misses an opportunity to rip us off even in the midst of a pandemic that’s killed more than 120k Americans. #COVID19 treatments MUST be affordable esp those that taxpayer $$ paid for.

Thank you to Cpl. Ally Jacob and Sgt. Schuyler Himberg for your great care when I got tested in St. Johnsbury!
