Please join me in prayer for @realDonaldTrump &amp; @FLOTUS as they recover from COVID-19. Like so many Americans the Trumps tested positive for the disease despite showing no symptoms. I have every hope their status will remain positive &amp; they will both have a swift recovery.,2020-10-02 14:11:07,TweetDeck,5,23,covid; 
Democrat Leader @StenyHoyer just told the entire House that “no one should schedule themselves for next week.”   What he wants is for House members to do nothing but wait for Speaker Pelosi to decide if we’re going to have a vote on new coronavirus legislation.,2020-07-31 16:41:26,TweetDeck,5,8,corona; 
I'm alarmed by the far-left policies @SpeakerPelosi continues to sneak into coronavirus relief bills including anti-Second Amendment gun control measures.  Check out my thoughts on this in the @dcexaminer --&gt;  https://t.co/r07MpFh8io,2020-05-07 15:44:16,TweetDeck,23,30,corona; 
I'm in DC this morning for today's vote on the new funds for #PPPloans other SBA loans &amp; COVID-19 testing. I'm proud to support a clean bill w/ no unrelated policy riders. Our small biz owners needed action from us weeks ago but I'm glad we're finally getting them this aid.,2020-04-23 14:37:32,TweetDeck,36,152,covid; 
#DearNancyPelosi   How do wind and solar tax credits (meant to harm the oil &amp; gas industry my district relies on - but that's a topic for another day) help the workers losing their paychecks right now as a result of #Covid19?,2020-03-24 17:17:41,TweetDeck,7,14,covid; 
#DearNancyPelosi   Why did you tank a bipartisan stimulus package that could have passed the House &amp; been signed by @realdonaldtrump ASAP? Was it the direct cash to suffering Americans or the much-needed aid to medical workers on the frontlines of #Covid19 that put you off?,2020-03-24 17:00:02,TweetDeck,4,10,covid; 
#DearNancyPelosi   The #GreenNewDeal was overwhelmingly shot down in the Senate last year. Why are you caving to a freshman socialist and sneaking GND provisions into what should be a #Covid19 relief package?,2020-03-24 15:51:05,TweetDeck,8,16,covid; 
#DearNancyPelosi  Where were you while the Senate worked day &amp; night – with a strongly bipartisan task force – to create a stimulus package that provides aid directly to the people most impacted by #Covid19?,2020-03-24 15:49:52,TweetDeck,7,9,covid; 
#DearNancyPelosi  With #Covid19 spreading through our country why do you want to divert $35 MILLION to the Kennedy Center in Washington DC?,2020-03-24 15:29:17,TweetDeck,6,12,covid; 
#DearNancyPelosi   What good does a bailout of the Post Office do to the millions of Americans out of work and suffering from #Covid19?,2020-03-24 15:23:07,TweetDeck,4,10,covid; 
Proud to join @RepJimBanks @sethmoulton &amp; a bipartisan coalition in the House as a cosponsor of this resolution condemning the Chinese Communist Party not only for misleading the world on #Covid19 but pushing blame on the US with a propaganda campaign.  https://t.co/SlIvkYuRJX,2020-03-24 14:26:25,TweetDeck,1571,1770,covid; 
Today I wrote a letter to @SpeakerPelosi urging her to keep Congress in session until we have a coronavirus bill that can be passed by the Senate and signed by @realDonaldTrump into law. My letter is linked here: https://t.co/VFWcWYo49o,2020-03-13 20:43:40,TweetDeck,7,18,corona;
