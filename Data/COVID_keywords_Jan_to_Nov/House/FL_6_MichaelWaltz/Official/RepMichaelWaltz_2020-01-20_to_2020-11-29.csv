Nancy Pelosi says she wants to help Americans in the fight against #COVID — but tens of thousands of small businesses could close permanently if she doesn’t put partisan politics aside.  Speaker Pelosi it's time to act. We must release the BILLIONS of unused #PPP funds NOW.,2020-11-27 19:16:00,Twitter Web App,390,1260,covid; 
It has been EIGHT MONTHS since we passed bipartisan COVID relief.   Rather than release already-passed #PPP funding Nancy Pelosi has refused choosing to play politics instead.
