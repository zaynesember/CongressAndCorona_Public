#China is one of the world's biggest polluters lied to the world about #COVID and then the #CCP tried to withhold life-saving PPE from America.

Good news to start your week: Moderna’s vaccine is 94.5% effective against #COVID__19.   This means the US could have two vaccines as early as December to vaccinate nearly 60 million people.
