This past quarter our economy had a record-setting 33.1% GDP growth.   Republicans built the greatest economy in decades before COVID-19 and by putting American workers in the driver's seat we will do it again.   We need your vote to send Ron back to Congress &amp; keep TX RED! 🇺🇸 https://t.co/7RtC3vXNrz,2020-10-30 22:54:18,Twitter for iPhone,2,6,covid; 
I'm proud to have supported the Paycheck Protection Program that has helped save over 4.5 MILLION jobs here in Texas as we recover from COVID-19.   Small businesses like Collin Street Bakery are what make Texas so great and I will always fight for them in Congress. https://t.co/MhhdHmV3S9,2020-10-22 23:19:26,Twitter for iPhone,2,10,covid; 
In Speaker Pelosi's latest COVID-19 package she DEFUNDS the Police by $600 million. This is an outrage!  Now more than ever we need to stand behind the brave men &amp; women who put on the uniform every day to protect us and provide them with more resources not less. #BackTheBlue https://t.co/5fzzqPSram,2020-10-09 14:25:27,Twitter for iPhone,0,5,covid;
