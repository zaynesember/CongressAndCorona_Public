#COVID19 has made the health disparities that have long existed in America all the more apparent. That’s why I’m standing with @CAPAC @HispanicCaucus @OfficialCBC during #MinorityHealthMonth to take on the structural inequalities that contribute to these disparities. #NMHM2020,2020-04-30 20:27:50,Twitter for iPhone,24,51,covid;

Today I sent a letter to @SpeakerPelosi calling on Congress to create a Select Committee to investigate the disproportionate percentage of minority mortality from COVID-19. In Louisiana 70% of COVID-19 related deaths are from the Black community. We must act soon to save lives. https://t.co/Q8Bx4zIk60,2020-04-09 00:20:11,Twitter for iPhone,79,183,covid;

Yesterday I held a tele-town hall for my constituents on COVID-19. While I was glad to address their questions it became clear to me how much our seniors depend on us during this challenging time. I’m calling on the federal government to expand the Meals on Wheels program.,2020-03-14 18:31:22,Twitter for iPhone,14,64,covid; 
UPDATE: The Louisiana Department of Health has reported its first presumptive positive case of the Coronavirus this afternoon. Please continue to wash your hands thoroughly and stay home if you feel sick.,2020-03-09 18:57:23,Twitter for iPhone,3,4,corona; 
While Louisiana is still one of 16 states without a confirmed case of the Coronavirus it’s still in good form to wash your hands thoroughly for at least 20 seconds. Any one of these recommended Nola songs will help keep you upbeat in the process. https://t.co/nFlarDP6ys,2020-03-09 15:03:57,Twitter for iPhone,16,28,corona;
