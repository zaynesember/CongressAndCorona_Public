It’s past time Congress gets to the bottom of how this pandemic began &amp; China’s failed response.

Congressional Democrats will take any opportunity to oppose &amp; attack @realdonaldtrump.

January 30 @DrTedros &amp; @WHO lauded China for their response to #COVID19. Meanwhile - China was jailing doctors &amp; "quarantining" those who spoke up about #COVID19.

My resolution has 2 requirements:  1⃣ WHO Director-General @DrTedros must step down.
