Asking the World Health Organization to conduct a fair and impartial review of the origins of the coronavirus is absolutely laughable.  Don't forget - The @WHO helped the Chinese Communist Party cover up the origins of this pandemic in January. https://t.co/hqsSFU6qlE,2020-07-13 21:06:46,Twitter Web App,3,4,corona; 
It's evident we need 4 more years of @realdonaldtrump's successful leadership now more than ever.  He created the most successful economy in 50 years with record low unemployment millions of new jobs &amp; record wage growth. He can do it again post-COVID. https://t.co/4UYK6xQXou,2020-06-23 14:11:10,Twitter for iPhone,3,9,covid; 
It's time to put together an independent investigation into WHO and the CCP's response to #COVID19.   I introduced a resolution last month calling for just this action. Let's work with the EU to get to the bottom of this cover up.  https://t.co/6d3qoIESpZ,2020-05-22 16:17:42,Twitter for iPhone,16,31,covid;

One of my top priorities during #COVID19 is to fight for small businesses and get our economy growing again. It’s time we secure our supply chain and bring manufacturing jobs back to the US. I will not stop fighting for our workers and businesses during this crisis. https://t.co/SHmKHXb3vt,2020-05-06 21:26:35,Twitter for iPhone,5,7,covid; 
Speaker Pelosi is ignoring the threats China posed on public health and safety. She refuses to hold China accountable for their misdeeds regarding #COVID19. Luckily @kevinomccarthy stepped in to get to the bottom of this coverup. https://t.co/3NE4R9oKhU,2020-05-06 15:22:49,Twitter for iPhone,3,4,covid;
