1/3 of all U.S. Coronavirus deaths have occurred in just three states: New York New Jersey California.  All are controlled by Democratic Governors and majorities in their State Legislatures.

China hid the true extent of Coronavirus for weeks or longer - and the WHO covered for them. We can’t forget that China caused this disaster and we must hold them accountable. https://t.co/akjD1p69wR,2020-06-03 13:02:52,Twitter Web App,1329,1372,corona;

There are reports that pro-abortion groups like Planned Parenthood applied for and received government money that was meant to help businesses negatively affected by the coronavirus.
