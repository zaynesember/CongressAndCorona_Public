One of the many things I'm thankful for this #Thanksgiving2020 is the @OHNationalGuard. 2000 OH National Guardsmen/women have stepped up to serve during #COVID19 maintaining testing sites distributing #PPE &amp; helping food banks distribute 33+ million lbs of food to those in need,2020-11-24 17:28:19,Twitter Web App,3,8,covid;

Very glad to see the #CARESAct continue providing relief for our local #SmallBusinesses.   The best way we can support these businesses is to do our part to keep #Covid_19 from spreading so they can stay open while keeping their workers &amp; customers safe. https://t.co/2N33Nz33jw,2020-11-17 14:35:03,Twitter Web App,1,4,covid; 
Public-private partnerships like this are critical to our ongoing efforts to address #COVID19.

The unfortunate reality is that nearly 1 million Ohioans can’t access education or health care services during the #COVID19 pandemic or are limited in seeking job opportunities in today’s economy bc the #broadband connectivity required to do so doesn’t exist where they live.,2020-10-20 15:52:44,Twitter Web App,2,12,covid;

Proud that one of those signatures is mine. #PPP has saved 77k+ #jobs in OH-14 but it can save more.

That’s why I joined @SenStabenow @senrobportman @RepMarcyKaptur @RepHuizenga @RepDebDingell in urging Congressional leaders to support #GreatLakes fisheries in the next #COVID19 package.

While the CARES Act provided $300 million to aid #fisheries impacted by the #COVID19 pandemic the law has been interpreted in a way that doesn’t allow the #GreatLakes region to qualify for that assistance.,2020-09-03 16:13:41,Twitter for iPhone,1,8,covid; 
The CARES Act is a product of bipartisanship in Congress - something we need more of right now. The stakes are too high for the partisan bickering to continue.  It's past time for negotiations on the next #COVID__19 relief package to restart.,2020-09-02 13:58:11,Twitter Web App,0,5,covid; 
Great to see CARES Act funding continue to lift up #SmallBusiness &amp; workers in Northeast #Ohio who were negatively impacted by #COVID19.
