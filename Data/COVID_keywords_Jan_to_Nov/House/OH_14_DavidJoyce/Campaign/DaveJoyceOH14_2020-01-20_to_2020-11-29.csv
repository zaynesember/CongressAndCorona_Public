When the pandemic hit I worked closely with Governor DeWine to save lives. I led the charge in Congress to secure more than $100 billion dollars for hospitals ensured medical workers had critical supplies to stay safe and voted to make coronavirus testing free. https://t.co/e3GqgnqImD,2020-10-21 13:00:36,Twitter Web App,3,6,corona; 
I am a firm believer in bipartisanship and compromise. Last week the Problem Solvers Caucus proposed a new coronavirus relief package. Congress needs to put party aside and take action to help struggling families overcome the challenges of this pandemic. https://t.co/gpIMSSqVZi,2020-09-21 20:17:44,Twitter Web App,2,8,corona; 
Great conversations at the first-ever Punjabi-Americans for Dave coalition roundtable. These healthcare and business leaders discussed how COVID-19 has affected their communities and how Congress can continue to provide support. I’m proud to have them in my corner this election. https://t.co/YEnJrns2c2,2020-09-05 15:56:39,Twitter for iPhone,2,3,covid; 
The News Herald editorial board applauded my efforts urging House leadership to pass comprehensive opioid legislation. As overdoses skyrocket during COVID-19 Congress must move quickly to pass my legislation the COPE Act to help battle this epidemic. https://t.co/KBk9L5LiJo,2020-08-24 17:42:36,Twitter Web App,1,4,covid; 
Thank you @realdonaldtrump for signing my bill the Safeguarding America’s First Responders Act of 2020 into law. This critical legislation guarantees financial security to the families of our heroic first responders battling COVID-19 on the frontlines. https://t.co/kjW3XljZfn,2020-08-21 16:43:04,Twitter Web App,2,5,covid; 
The opioid epidemic has ravaged our communities and COVID-19 has only made the problem worse. Everyday Congress refuses to act more people suffer. I’m calling on Speaker Pelosi to bring my bill the COPE Act to a vote ASAP. https://t.co/A8G0ZX8wNi,2020-08-18 15:20:34,Twitter for iPhone,2,4,covid; 
Thank you to members of @NATCA in NE Ohio for joining me on a virtual discussion and helping #TeamJoyce make thousands of phone calls to voters.

Many public service workers have been laid-off or furloughed due to the coronavirus pandemic. Their student loan forgiveness should not be put at risk provided they re-enter public service after the pandemic.

The risk for domestic abuse has substantially increased during COVID-19. However the opportunity for students to report abuse to educators has drastically decreased due to the nature of remote learning. Online platforms must adapt to give students an opportunity to report abuse. https://t.co/KJiuXJao2f,2020-06-04 22:21:06,Twitter for iPhone,3,5,covid; 
Child abuse reports have dropped 50% since the COVID pandemic began. Last week I sent a letter to @BetsyDeVosED urging the @usedgov to make sure students who are at risk of abuse at home can still report these cases and get help from proper authorities. https://t.co/7747SbiF5J,2020-06-02 14:41:22,Twitter for iPad,2,3,covid;

In Ohio we all know someone who has been touched by the opioid epidemic. Unfortunately new stressors caused by COVID-19 threaten to fuel the next wave of the opioid crisis. That’s why bipartisan legislation to provide more funding for law enforcement and treatment is critical. https://t.co/cGZe92rMJZ,2020-05-26 20:51:47,Twitter Web App,4,10,covid; 
This #MilitaryAppreciationMonth we salute our veterans and active men and women in uniform for their bravery and self-sacrifice.  I’m glad the CARES Act secured nearly $20 billion to help our nation’s veterans during COVID-19 but there’s more to do. https://t.co/iyaFAVGOpJ,2020-05-20 14:03:42,Twitter for iPad,3,7,covid; 
I’m working hard to provide bipartisan solutions to save lives and livelihoods. I helped secure $25 billion for COVID-19 testing and $40 million for Ohio’s hospitals and healthcare systems. I’m working with @MikeDeWine to safely reopen our economy and get Ohioans back to work. https://t.co/KrW8oK48wD,2020-05-18 17:21:28,Twitter Web App,3,12,covid;

We cannot allow COVID-19 to fuel the next wave of the opioid crisis. In Congress I have fought for bipartisan solutions to end the opioid epidemic and voted to increase funding for treatment and resources. We’ve made great progress and we can’t stop now. https://t.co/Fvdbm2JCXe,2020-04-27 17:14:21,Twitter Web App,2,4,covid;
