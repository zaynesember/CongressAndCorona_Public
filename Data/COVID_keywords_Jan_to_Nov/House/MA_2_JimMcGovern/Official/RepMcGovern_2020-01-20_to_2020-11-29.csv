When I say the lack of leadership at the White House is a disaster this is what I mean:  "On the evening of April 10 the @DeptofDefense received approval from the White House Task Force to execute the first DPA Title 3 project responding to COVID-19." https://t.co/dR6yAxg1Eb,2020-04-13 22:46:48,Twitter Web App,13,44,covid; 
Everyone needs to watch. Even before #COVID19 #hunger was a dire problem in America — now the level of hunger &amp; food insecurity we are seeing is nothing short of a humanitarian catastrophe.  Congress MUST prioritize food in our next coronavirus relief package. https://t.co/DA8TiQjy7K,2020-04-11 22:13:10,Twitter for iPhone,298,723,covid; corona; 
It's not surprising that America's racial disparities are reflected in our broken healthcare system. But it is outrageous and wrong.  Communities of color are being disproportionately impacted by #COVID19.  We need data. We need action. We need justice. https://t.co/KCp3wam70B,2020-04-08 01:52:43,Twitter Web App,14,59,covid;
