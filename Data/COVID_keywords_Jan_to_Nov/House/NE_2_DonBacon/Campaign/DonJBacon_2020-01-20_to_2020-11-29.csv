Congress has $135B in unused Paycheck Protection Plan funds that can help small businesses &amp; industries suffering from COVID. A clean bill should pass now but the Speaker is holding it hostage for non-COVID priorities she cannot otherwise pass. This should be passed immediately!,2020-11-28 21:40:23,Twitter for iPhone,10,37,covid; 
I ask for your vote today!   I delivered bipartisan results: ten bills passed to include getting masks mass produced in US for COVID; flood repairs for Offutt &amp; Camp Ashland; new housing in North O; highway improvements; University of NE research for DoD and new Offutt runway. https://t.co/JWh0rA3g6k,2020-11-03 12:42:06,Twitter for iPhone,11,70,covid; 
ICYMI: OWH endorsed my reelection praising my bipartisan efforts on COVID relief DACA stopping a govt shutdown post office juvenile justice reforms renewable energy &amp; racial inequality.   This race is about bipartisan results vs a far left agenda. https://t.co/yuzPqcTYbY,2020-10-26 13:31:01,Twitter for iPhone,10,22,covid; 
For a 2nd time today I thank ⁦@karaforcongress⁩ for making clear I worked to protect Americans against pandemics months before we even heard of COVID. My bill enabled mass production of masks in the US during a pandemic. W/out this we’d be dependent on China for masks. https://t.co/Fc2DXDTS6s,2020-10-19 18:19:44,Twitter for iPhone,13,36,covid; 
I thank @karaforcongress for highlighting that MONTHS BEFORE COVID became known I was ALREADY WORKING on our nation’s ability to respond to pandemics. What she meant as criticism is actually an acknowledgment of being PROACTIVE &amp; PROTECTING our great COUNTRY and our CITIZENS.,2020-10-19 15:04:08,Twitter for iPhone,17,72,covid; 
Kara Eastman's attempts to make me seem like a psychic who can predict pandemics are falling flat. It's funny that she thinks this is effective actually.  Leadership thinking ahead &amp; proper planning... that's why my bill passed allowing masks to be mass produced during COVID.,2020-10-18 23:18:50,Twitter Web App,9,18,covid; 
Kara thinks I had a crystal ball and knew COVID was coming.  No Kara. It's called leadership and the ability to look forward. I spent three decades in the military doing this... no crystal ball needed.,2020-10-18 23:16:22,Twitter Web App,11,25,covid; 
The HEROES Act was a far-left wish list: releasing felons from prison early defunding police and more. It was disguised as a COVID relief bill and Kara Eastman supports it.  She doesn't support the true bipartisan COVID relief framework we built in the Problem Solvers Caucus.,2020-10-18 23:12:51,Twitter Web App,10,18,covid; 
First question is about COVID and how to help those in need. My opponent says her plan is Joe Biden's plan and that she doesn't agree with her party.,2020-10-18 23:05:29,Twitter Web App,9,20,covid; 
@andrew_norman Tax revenues actually increased prior to COVID because our economy grew.,2020-10-14 03:42:50,Twitter for iPhone,0,0,covid; 
The question: what help should Congress provide to help people overcome COVID?  Kara: Don Bacon voted against the Heroes Act.  The Heroes Act would have released felons from prison without parole hearings and given the federal government control over our NE's elections. No thanks,2020-10-12 23:06:19,Twitter Web App,3,5,covid; 
My opponent is attacking the COVID response. Don't forget she criticized the CARES Act for WEEKS which saved 51 million jobs and provided resources to help families and small businesses.,2020-10-12 23:04:11,Twitter Web App,4,6,covid; 
“NE’s Small Businesses Endorsed Congressman Don Bacon’s Re-election.”  Small Biz is backbone of our economy. The CARES Act provided grants &amp; loans to 88% of Small Biz during COVID &amp; saved 51 million jobs. Yet my opponent called CARES “a corporate heist.” https://t.co/7i9ShxCCAn,2020-10-11 20:42:33,Twitter for iPhone,8,12,covid; 
The Heroes Act is a dreadful bill nothing but a far-left wish list disguised as COVID relief. It let felons out of prison early defunded police and more.  Pelosi won't consider the bipartisan COVID relief framework I helped write. Why? Because it isn't her wishlist.,2020-10-08 17:40:43,Twitter Web App,3,6,covid; 
The COVID vaccine was already funded. My opponent criticized the CARES Act.,2020-10-08 17:08:55,Twitter Web App,4,3,covid; 
The question was about what federal action should be taken to reduce the spread of COVID. Kara Eastman spent her 90 seconds saying masks work and Trump is bad. No plan. Not surprising considering she spent weeks attacking the CARES Act that saved 51 MILLION jobs.,2020-10-08 17:07:49,Twitter Web App,3,4,covid; 
Kara Eastman is talking about Pelosi's Heroes Act like it is nothing but a COVID relief bill. Couldn't be further from the truth. This bill was a far-left wish list that released felons from prison early bailed out huge coastal cities that already had budget issues &amp; more.,2020-10-08 00:13:18,Twitter Web App,6,12,covid; 
This partisan vote gave federal control over elections &amp; had an early release of felons from prison.  In contrast I worked with the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus to craft REAL covid relief framework that would have helped smallbiz but Speaker Pelosi won't even consider it.,2020-10-06 15:18:54,Twitter Web App,3,18,covid; 
25 Dems and 25 GOP came together and found consensus that would help save those elements in our economy suffering from COVID like our play-houses live venues commercial busses etc. People’s livelihoods depend on it. The “my way or the highway” approach is hurting Americans. https://t.co/1GTmHxecu1,2020-09-21 19:53:57,Twitter for iPhone,5,12,covid; 
We were able to find a compromise for another COVID relief bill. This is important with a few industries near collapse. But Speaker Pelosi said NO to compromise. This hyperpartisanship hurts Americans.  2/2,2020-09-21 14:48:39,Twitter Web App,5,16,covid; 
I’ve talked to many childcare providers this week &amp; most required the Paycheck Protection Plan from the CARES Act to stay open and not permanently close during the height of COVID.   Kara Eastman opposed the CARES Act saying it was a corporate heist. She’s too extreme for #NE02.,2020-09-12 13:15:14,Twitter for iPhone,28,47,covid; 
I supported CARES Act with the Paycheck Protection Plan that saved 51 million jobs during height of COVID. NE had second highest PPP utilization rate helping small businesses and nonprofits.  We won’t forget Kara Eastman opposed the CARES Act saying it was a “corporate heist.”,2020-09-10 13:18:35,Twitter for iPhone,25,40,covid; 
I supported the CARES Act that provided $175B in much needed COVID aid to hospitals and community health centers like our Charles Drew and One World.   We won’t forget that Kara Eastman opposed the CARES Act calling it a corporate heist! She’s too extreme for # NE02.,2020-09-10 00:36:43,Twitter for iPhone,7,29,covid; 
CARES Act helped small businesses survive saved 50 million jobs aided the unemployed &amp; rescued hospitals &amp; community healthcare centers from huge COVID expenses.   It passed overwhelmingly in the House &amp; Senate but yet @karaforcongress opposed it. She’s too extreme for #NE02. https://t.co/YZE9FGGQ76,2020-09-07 16:47:04,Twitter for iPhone,3,18,covid; 
I voted for CARES Act providing critical COVID financial relief: $1200 per adult paycheck protection to small businesses SAVING 50 MILLION JOBS federal $$ to unemployment insurance $140B to help hospitals &amp; community health centers.   We won’t forget Kara Eastman opposed it!,2020-09-07 11:19:15,Twitter for iPhone,12,58,covid; 
We need the USPS. I support a standalone bill to provide $25B in funding to the Post Office and that funding should NOT be part of the broader debate on COVID relief. #NE02  https://t.co/hfxrPndPmK,2020-08-15 16:20:52,Twitter for Android,6,40,covid; 
It has enabled me to pass the PREP Act to mass produce protective masks for COVID &amp; DHS Field Engagement Accountability Act that improves security of all Nebraskans. It has made possible the $800M rebuild of Offutt AFB $25M in new low income housing &amp; widened roads in Omaha. 3/,2020-07-31 15:34:15,Twitter Web App,3,10,covid; 
The bill my opponent supports would gut research and development for new medicine according to the CBO and other analysis. Less R&amp;D = less cures = more lives lost. Cutting R&amp;D in time of COVID is foolish. https://t.co/7GfuqjF63g,2020-07-20 23:13:02,Twitter for iPhone,4,14,covid;

In Nov. I introduced a bill that allowed more masks/respirators to be used by healthcare workers in times of crisis. Then COVID-19 happened. My bill was included in the CARES Act. Healthcare workers need the best equipment available for this fight. #NE02  https://t.co/wPKiUnManT,2020-06-18 14:55:56,Twitter Web App,6,15,covid; 
Congressional Budget Office studies showed HR3 which my opponent strongly supports would result in 10% reduction in cures &amp; new meds. Fewer cures = more lives lost. I support allowing our medical community to innovate &amp; create cures &amp; vaccines for diseases like COVID-19. #NE02,2020-06-16 22:47:44,Twitter Web App,6,24,covid; 
Director of the National Economic Council says "we are in the recovery stage" from COVID-19. We must keep the momentum going.
