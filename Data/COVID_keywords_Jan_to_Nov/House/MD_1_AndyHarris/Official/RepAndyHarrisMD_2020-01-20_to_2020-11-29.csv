Even the liberal New York Times is now saying children are not significant spreaders of COVID-19. Its about time we open all of Maryland’s schools - anything less is harming our children and kowtowing to the teachers’ unions. https://t.co/o1I0oIGprO,2020-10-23 17:29:40,Twitter for iPhone,9,40,covid;

Any talk of legalizing recreational marijuana is a bad idea especially in the midst of an opioid abuse and addiction crisis worsened by COVID. https://t.co/C4pRMU22Qs,2020-08-21 17:24:37,Twitter for iPhone,21,57,covid; 
According to the NIH the WHO and the American Lung Assoc. marijuana is MORE dangerous with COVID - it is NOT a treatment. Yet Speaker Pelosi insists on marijuana provisions in a COVID bill for the American people? https://t.co/FuaWU2kI8d,2020-08-03 15:42:36,Twitter for iPhone,104,137,covid;

The Senate “emergency” bill allows sanctuary cities to receive Justice Department grants that were stopped by the Trump administration. Sanctuary jurisdictions should not get federal money-and this is NOT related to the Coronavirus economic crisis.  #singleissuebills #skipthepork https://t.co/r7hzmFtlGh,2020-03-26 12:19:29,Twitter for iPhone,109,154,corona;

Speaker Pelosi knows that we should be debating the merits of a corporate minimum wage and employee selected board memberships in a separate bill.

In Speaker Pelosi’s bill only two colleges (out of thousands both just happening to be in DC and both private) were named to get a $20 million handout. Neither associated with COVID more than any other college.

This is really unbelievable. It’s on page 803 of the Speaker’s bill.  If Speaker Pelosi destroys the economy she won’t have to worry about getting the airline emissions part of the Green New Deal into the COVID-19 bill.

What does nullifying the President’s exec order on federal employee union issues have to do with COVID-19?  We have small businesses going out of business and this is a priority for the coronavirus crisis?

No voter ID to get a ballot and anonymous “ballot harvesting”...why is that hidden in Speaker Pelosi’s coronavirus bill? These are issues that shouldn’t be addressed at this time. #singleissuebills https://t.co/SjV2V15Qeu,2020-03-23 19:57:36,Twitter for iPhone,19388,25089,corona;
