Progress on a #COVID19 vaccine is encouraging but it’s not here yet. Let’s be the example this holiday season and not let our guard down.

Every day more and more Americans are dying of #COVID19. Yet Senate Republicans are focused on rushing to confirm the President’s #SCOTUS pick to overturn the #ACA.  A vote for the President’ nominee is a vote to take away healthcare from millions of Americans.,2020-10-12 19:48:26,Twitter for iPhone,24,46,covid; 
The President continues to defy CDC guidance to avoid large events and gatherings. Worse I have not yet heard he has tested negative for #COVID19 since being hospitalized.   This is reckless and irresponsible. We don’t need another super spreader event at the White House. https://t.co/Fl2YmfQiri,2020-10-09 20:53:23,Twitter for iPhone,15,50,covid;

The President is turning his back on the American people by walking away from Covid relief negotiations.  210K Americans are dead. Families are struggling. Small businesses are closing.  And still we don’t have a plan of action on COVID 19 testing &amp; contact tracing. Incompetent. https://t.co/pn6iDk96a5,2020-10-06 23:03:00,Twitter for iPhone,15,29,covid;

“Don’t be afraid of Covid” says the guy (POTUS) who is “getting world class medical care” per his doctors. Not only does he continue to downplay the harms of COVID but he is actively trying to strip away healthcare from Millions of Americans.,2020-10-05 19:17:38,Twitter for iPhone,58,110,covid; 
If POTUS and FLOTUS can contract #COVID19 any of us can. We all have to take precautions and wear masks but we must do more to protect the people.   It’s long overdue but we need a national coronavirus testing tracing and treatment plan. https://t.co/bCB1Ggb230,2020-10-03 18:06:17,Twitter for iPhone,13,41,covid; corona; 
The GOP has blocked action on critical #COVID19 relief funding for months.   $$ for schools unemployment and coronavirus testing: all blocked.

Unfortunately POTUS’ experience with COVID may determine if he changes his tune and attitude or not. If he quickly recovers &amp; is symptom free will he continue to mock those who wear a mask? Will he still say (re: deaths) “it is what it is”? Or continue to downplay its danger?,2020-10-02 06:16:44,Twitter for iPhone,20,93,covid; 
200k+ Americans have died of COVID-19. No one wants more deaths.

Many discussions on how next #coronavirus bill can best help workers &amp; consumers  I support directly sending checks to American families. People will need financial help   A refundable tax credit may take too long to help &amp; won't help lower-income workers  https://t.co/ESS9xTyBM5,2020-03-18 13:31:15,Twitter Web App,12,26,corona; 
19 colleagues &amp; I just urged the WH not to include a fossil fuel bailout in any #Coronavirus stimulus package.   Diverting public funds to bail out #BigOil will do nothing to stop the spread of #COVID19 or provide relief to those in need. It will only worsen the #ClimateCrisis.,2020-03-17 20:29:44,Twitter Web App,92,252,covid; corona; 
This is wrong. @DHS has no better priority than go after families during this health crisis?   @ICEgov should suspend enforcement during this #Coronavirus public health emergency. https://t.co/m1lnBHUTPI,2020-03-17 18:54:21,Twitter Web App,41,66,corona;

Great educational video (and cute). I saw this and thought about me and my mom too. Our community can benefit from this video. WATCH and please adhere to #SocialDistance.

Join me and a medical expert Thursday night (3/19) at 7 pm for my Telephone Town Hall to discuss #coronavirus #SocialDistancing the local state and federal response and what you can do to keep yourself and your family safe.

#SocialDistance is how we limit spread of #COVID19 &amp; keep it from overrunning our healthcare system.  Even if they think they are safe young people unknowingly spread it to parents grandparents &amp; vulnerable neighbors.  Please adhere to #SocialDistancing. Let’s all do our part.,2020-03-16 18:51:49,Twitter Web App,14,31,covid; socialdistance;

Major failure by Trump Admin. Unprepared for travel ban they implemented. Poor planning for screenings of Americans returning from Europe meant huge crowds in tight spaces at airports-putting travelers at great risk of spreading #Covid19.  We need answers  https://t.co/6ii4fRRoez,2020-03-15 12:26:45,Twitter Web App,34,79,covid; 
Long day but momentarily I will join my colleagues to vote for the #FamiliesFirst #Coronavirus Response Act to provide:  •free &amp; widespread testing •paid sick leave •food security for low-income kids •       protections for frontline healthcare workers •and more,2020-03-14 04:30:33,Twitter Web App,25,150,corona; 
President just doesn’t understand how things work. #COVID19 is in the US. We don’t know how bad because we are not testing enough. Huge failure. And unequal access to testing is another huge problem. We need to know how many have it and where to stop the spread &amp;limit fatalities. https://t.co/BFr6fqrfjc,2020-03-13 17:30:58,Twitter for iPhone,21,65,covid; 
Last night 20 Calif. colleagues and I urgently requested President trump to declare a federal emergency on #Covid_19  https://t.co/OqEMbbjR7b https://t.co/TZjNNwFG91,2020-03-13 16:09:12,Twitter Web App,6,13,covid; 
It is wrong for the Trump Admin. to restrict $ states can use to fight #COVID19. We need every tool available   But Trump is making a political point by restricting use of Medicaid–making it harder for low-income people to get testing or medical help.  https://t.co/fzMmWQtISC,2020-03-13 15:49:50,Twitter Web App,22,35,covid; 
Tonight 20 Calif. colleagues and I urgently requested Pres. Trump declare a federal emergency on #Covid_19   A federal declaration of emergency will allow Calif's community health centers to utilize more tools to help people in this public health crisis.  https://t.co/xwgLbcy6yu,2020-03-12 23:36:18,Twitter Web App,33,69,covid; 
* Free #coronavirus testing * Protecting front-line healthcare workers * Paid emergency leave * Enhanced food security  This is how we confront this #COVID19 public health crisis.   @HouseDemocrats are ready to pass the #FamiliesFirst Act right now!   https://t.co/v9ZbVWuO0d,2020-03-12 21:35:04,Twitter Web App,21,70,covid; corona; 
Every person who needs a #COVID19 test should get a #Covid19 test. Period.  And it should be free.  That’s why the #FamiliesFirst Act makes #coronavirus testing free to all. Congress must pass this legislation immediately. https://t.co/F8wUSWwjxD,2020-03-12 20:37:50,Twitter Web App,15,31,covid; corona; 
Seniors concerned about exposure to #COVID19 should not have to worry about the costs of being tested.   That’s why @RepRonKind @RepLoriTrahan and I wrote the part of today's bill to ensure these #Coronavirus tests are covered by #MedicareAdvantage at no cost to patients.,2020-03-12 14:53:38,Twitter Web App,10,37,covid; corona; 
Diverting public $ to bail out #BigOil will do nothing to stop the spread of #COVID19 or help those affected.  Using this crisis as an excuse for another giveaway to oil &amp; gas is badly misguided. It would only worsen the #climatecrisis.  #ActOnClimate  https://t.co/gk7Ooj6OUI,2020-03-11 22:48:30,Twitter Web App,34,69,covid; 
.@WHO just declared #COVID19 a #Pandemic.   This is not time to push corporate tax cuts or a political agenda.  It is time to act on the advice of doctors &amp; scientists to do everything possible to contain a public health threat and help those affected.  https://t.co/yIwhkLaNjT,2020-03-11 17:14:34,Twitter Web App,17,33,covid; 
Pres. Trump needs to focus on real ways to control the #Coronavirus outbreak and stop going back to his playbook of distraction and demonizing immigrants.  He tries to change the subject and say “we need The Wall” but CDC director says it wouldn’t help.   https://t.co/CnTFcf1uVf,2020-03-11 14:08:09,Twitter Web App,29,43,corona;

Just voted for #Covid19 emergency funding which passed w/overwhelming bipartisan support  It's needed to address the seriousness of the public health crisis. Includes $ for developing vaccines prevention diagnostics &amp; lab testing and support for state &amp; local health agencies. https://t.co/wAbt7rNgJc,2020-03-04 22:17:31,Twitter Web App,8,33,covid; 
Coronavirus requires a coordinated fully-funded whole-of-government response to keep Americans safe.

Today I demanded an FBI investigation into misinformation being spread in #CA44 about the #coronavirus   It is important news on coronavirus comes from health officials and experts.
