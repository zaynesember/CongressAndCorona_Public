971 Americans died yesterday due to COVID-19. Republicans are not pro-life they are COVID deniers. #COVID19 https://t.co/YTxT09m9DG,2020-10-30 19:41:22,Twitter Web App,6,12,covid; 
The president who is currently infected with COVID-19 hosted an event with 2000 people today where he claimed COVID is “disappearing” on a day where our country is reporting more than 50000 new cases for the first time since mid-August. He is not well. #Trump #COVID19,2020-10-10 20:50:03,Twitter for iPhone,25,55,covid; 
The president fails the American people time and time again. From COVID denialism and no national strategy to ending stimulus talks — leaving millions of Americans behind to suffer. We did our job but he is incapable of doing his. #TrumpFailedAmerica #Vote,2020-10-06 21:08:39,Twitter for iPhone,4,4,covid; 
The president currently infected and pumped full of a combination of drugs most Americans have never taken or have access to is still practicing COVID denialism and harming the public. He’s a public health nightmare. https://t.co/k6CNwTuJIJ,2020-10-06 17:29:56,Twitter Web App,0,1,covid; 
Trump is an American failure indeed. Bless the souls of all those who have lost their lives to COVID-19. It simply didn’t need to be this bad. #TrumpKnew https://t.co/Tu37ikizNI,2020-09-10 21:01:43,Twitter for iPhone,4,2,covid; 
This is the same man who when asked about 1000 Americans dying a day from COVID said: “It is what it is.” https://t.co/0xypIt0Dfq,2020-08-04 16:20:43,Twitter for iPhone,6,14,covid; 
COVID-19 can’t stop the 19th annual women’s power luncheon. I may be in a room speaking on a computer instead of a room with all of you but the excitement is real. We’re ready to kick Donald Trump &amp; his enablers out of office and continue to fight for economic &amp; racial justice. https://t.co/QdrwlPpGEp,2020-07-20 18:11:43,Twitter for iPhone,7,8,covid; 
The Trump administration has spent more time trying to rip healthcare coverage from Americans than scaling out a national plan to defeat COVID. It’s pathetic. #VoteThemOut #ProtectOurCare  https://t.co/sZ0f1SBYar,2020-06-26 17:15:32,Twitter for iPhone,2,3,covid; 
The president may have gotten bored and tired of his job but we still do not have a national strategy in combatting COVID-19. We need to be producing PPE and medical equipment and tests and vaccines must be free for all.  https://t.co/jOQ7uOc32V,2020-06-22 19:32:56,Twitter for iPhone,9,4,covid; 
The fastest and most effective way to help the families in Illinois harmed by economic impacts of COVID-19 is with direct cash payments. My colleagues and I are pushing for legislation that would establish payments of $2000 a month for adults and $1000 for children.,2020-05-11 21:03:19,Twitter Web App,1,5,covid; 
It is clear that this one-time stimulus is not enough to meet Americans’ needs. We must establish monthly payments and we must increase the amount of money received to help people like Magdalena and Arica make ends meet for the length of the COVID-19 crisis.,2020-05-11 21:02:21,Twitter Web App,1,3,covid; 
Since the beginning of the coronavirus crisis nearly one million Illinois residents have filed for unemployment benefits — more than one of every 10 Illinois workers.,2020-05-11 21:01:33,Twitter Web App,0,2,corona; 
From a plan to a bill I’m proud to be partnering with @ewarren on this critical legislation to ensure we have what we need to fight COVID-19 &amp; protect Americans. #GetUsPPE https://t.co/y5oU8VT7iV,2020-04-30 19:38:45,Twitter for iPhone,3,3,covid;

It’s clear our intelligence &amp; public officials tried to warn the president of the danger of #COVID19 in America and he didn’t listen. He didn’t just miss the call — he missed months of calls and warnings from public health officials. He’s caused a public health nightmare. https://t.co/wqexlaptbn,2020-03-21 21:53:06,Twitter for iPhone,13,8,covid; 
We put families first—period. I’m proud of @TeamPelosi and our caucus for prioritizing families and people impacted. #FamiliesFirst #Coronavirus https://t.co/vgmBU1DwYN,2020-03-14 01:04:43,Twitter Web App,134,614,corona;

.@WHO has declared the #Coronavirus a pandemic meanwhile you are acting like a man child spreading sad and dangerous rhetoric. You can’t wish away a pandemic - do your job and protect the American people. https://t.co/JJFtc1l4MJ,2020-03-11 21:26:38,Twitter for iPhone,5,9,corona;
