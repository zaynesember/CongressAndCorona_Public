Since @SeemaCMS refused to testify @EnergyCommerce on the #COVID19 crisis in nursing homes I questioned @CDCDirector Redfield.

Today I led 45 of my colleagues to demand that @realDonaldTrump ensures any #coronavirus vaccine or treatment developed with U.S. taxpayer $ is accessible &amp; affordable.
