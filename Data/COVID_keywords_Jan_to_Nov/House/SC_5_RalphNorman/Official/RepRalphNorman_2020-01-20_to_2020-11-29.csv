Long before this pandemic Congress should have been working to slash unnecessary spending.  If *trillions* of unexpected borrowing needed for COVID response won't get this conversation started now then what will?  https://t.co/NSoFicaprL,2020-08-06 19:09:45,Twitter Web App,4,9,covid;

Last week I introduced a bill to help #Congress and health officials better understand the degree to which #TSA checkpoints could serve in some limited capacity as a way to help mitigate the spread of #COVID and future pandemics.

New York the epicenter of our coronavirus crisis with more than one-third of all cases nationally is actually TAXING out-of-state healthcare workers who came to help the Empire State during its time of need.  This is wrong.  https://t.co/vO0xwKZ9or,2020-05-06 16:32:20,Twitter Web App,55,60,corona;
