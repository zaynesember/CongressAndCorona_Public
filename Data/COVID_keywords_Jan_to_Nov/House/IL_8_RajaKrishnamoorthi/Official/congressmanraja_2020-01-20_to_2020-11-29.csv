Antibody testing for #COVID19 could eventually be a critical tool for reopening the economy. But the tests currently on the market have not been validated by the #FDA.

Not only do the tests need to work doctors and patients need to know how to use them effectively to fight COVID-19.

The @US_FDA has not authorized any at-home tests for coronavirus but companies are taking consumers' money for tests that may not work. People are scared.

I've heard from many Asian-American friends and constituents about COVID-19-related bigotry similar to what @saruhli described recently: "Even stepping outside for groceries is terrifying as strangers approach me with hostility." https://t.co/lwxttS49H2,2020-03-23 14:30:55,Twitter Web App,20,58,covid; 
President Trump may be crossing out "Coronavirus" on official documents and replacing it with "Chinese Virus" as a xenophobic stunt to distract from the failures of his response to #COVID-19 but everyone needs to recognize there is a huge cost to playing off of racist paranoia. https://t.co/4Bmi3InLO2,2020-03-23 14:08:31,Twitter Web App,85,267,covid; corona; 
Calling #COVID19 the "Chinese Virus" doesn't strengthen any public health response or do anything to help our country through this pandemic. All it does is stoke racism against Asian-Americans without regard for their safety to distract from the President's own failures. https://t.co/eI3WiWwmv7,2020-03-18 16:56:10,Twitter Web App,235,804,covid; 
We are better than this and we must be. It's not just one anecdote: incidents like this are happening across the country as racism cloaked in coronavirus fears strikes at the personal and physical wellbeing of Asian Americans.

Probably not the best sign when the most reassuring and reasonable interpretation would be that a sitting US senator is swearing his vengeance upon a virus. We need to combat #COVID19 and keep everyone as safe as possible but I'm not certain what this has to do with that. https://t.co/6hShP0jGQg,2020-03-12 16:17:20,Twitter Web App,24,115,covid; 
This evening I spoke with @andersoncooper on @CNN about how the testimony of witnesses before the #coronavirus hearing I co-chaired including Dr. Fauci of the NIH differed significantly from what we’ve heard from @realDonaldTrump and his Administration. https://t.co/IzWkXttp4o,2020-03-12 01:13:00,Twitter Media Studio,34,111,corona;

At today’s @oversightdems hearing @CDCgov director Redfield was unable to commit to setting specific goals and timelines for #coronavirus testing in America.

South Korea and the US developed #coronavirus tests at the same time but South Korea is now testing 4000 people per million while the US is now only testing 15 per million. That means South Korea is testing 300x more people than the US. @realDonaldTrump what is going on? https://t.co/OuVATmOMQM,2020-03-11 16:07:47,Twitter Media Studio,325,660,corona;

Today I spoke with @KateBolduan on @CNN about how we cannot stand idly by as uninsured and underinsured patients are unable to obtain testing and treatment for #coronavirus. Doing so would be irresponsible immoral and cause unthinkable damage to our communities. https://t.co/ynKzdrSb9E,2020-03-06 17:30:00,Twitter Media Studio,39,132,corona; 
As we work to address the spread of #coronavirus it is imperative that patients are not being turned away because of their insurance.

I spoke with @JWhitePubRadio on @WBEZ recently about the federal response to #coronavirus. This Administration has withheld important information from the public and that’s why @OversightDems is having a hearing on March 10th to get answers. https://t.co/4u0u2bjkJY,2020-03-06 14:47:57,Twitter Web App,29,62,corona; 
Recent reports have shown evidence of faulty testing inconsistent reporting and inaccurate diagnoses in the response to the #coronavirus outbreak which is why @OversightDems and I have opened an investigation.  https://t.co/xcUSHmgYCQ,2020-03-04 21:00:01,TweetDeck,37,98,corona;
