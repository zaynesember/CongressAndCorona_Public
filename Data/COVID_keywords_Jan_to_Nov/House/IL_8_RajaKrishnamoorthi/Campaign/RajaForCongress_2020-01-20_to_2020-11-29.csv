If you’re one of the hundreds of thousands of Americans who have received a test for COVID-19 antibodies the Food and Drug Administration has some bad news for you: you may have been the victim of a scam the FDA enabled. https://t.co/h2gqzX782v,2020-08-12 00:24:45,Twitter Web App,1,1,covid;

I joined the Roe Conn show on  @WGNRadio to discuss how hundreds of dollars in coronavirus relief payments went to the deceased: “we have to conduct oversight on this and try to get to the bottom of how did this happen in the first place."  https://t.co/IebtA2bqf8,2020-06-27 15:20:44,Twitter Web App,1,0,corona; 
Congress will be pursuing answers on this because the American people deserve to know if their president sabotaged efforts to detect and contain COVID-19 because he didn’t like the results. The result he needs to focus on is the lives we can save.   https://t.co/Z1G1ciCzkZ,2020-06-23 04:58:52,Twitter for iPhone,1,1,covid;

Puff Bar is quickly becoming the new Juul because their ads are targeting young people. I wrote a letter to the FDA calling out Puff Bar for exploiting COVID-19 to sell their products. https://t.co/hCXmUDtQMB,2020-06-04 02:06:51,Twitter Web App,1,0,covid;

I am flying back to DC to vote on the #HeroesAct. This legislation will not only extend the expanded unemployment insurance but it will also provide needed assistance to State &amp; Local Governments.

The Trump Administration did little to stop the inflow of the #Covid19 virus through our airports until Mid-March. Trump disregarded valuable opportunities to slow the spread and he failed at that. https://t.co/yHSTjfquJc,2020-05-08 20:58:18,Twitter Web App,0,0,covid; 
The FDA went too far completely abrogating regulatory responsibility regarding their oversight of the #COVID19 antibody tests. Now individuals are at risk with false positives and possibly putting themselves or those around them at risk. #Unacceptable! https://t.co/jPhTa9R4jX,2020-05-06 05:16:37,Twitter Web App,1,1,covid;

I joined @AliVelshi  to discuss the congressional investigation I am leading into the matter of false #COVID19 antibody tests.

The FDA has allowed hundreds of unreliable tests into the market. The problem is many have high false positive rates.

The Federal state and local governments are working round the clock to ensure our communities have the testing we need to combat #COVID19.

My wife had to buy a welder's mask to protect herself. If we don’t provide the people fighting COVID-19 on the frontlines the resources they need they’ll no longer be able to treat patients they’ll become them.  https://t.co/XNBVkL11mV,2020-04-05 23:57:00,Twitter Web App,1,0,covid; 
Allowing e-cigs to remain on the market will harm users throughout the country and exacerbate the #COVID19  crisis in critical way.

Cost should not be a barrier to getting test for the coronavirus. If people don't feel they can afford getting tested when they feel sick we are putting our community at risk.
