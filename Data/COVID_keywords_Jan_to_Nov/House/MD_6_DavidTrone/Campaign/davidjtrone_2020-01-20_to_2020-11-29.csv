Unfortunately that’s easier said than done for the countless Americans struggling with addiction. COVID is going to have a silver bullet. We’ll have a vaccine and it’s going to be here soon. But there will never be a vaccine for addiction and that’s why I won’t stop fighting.,2020-11-20 20:44:51,Twitter Web App,0,0,covid; 
Whether we’re white Black or Brown Republican Democrat or Independent COVID-19 and addiction are indiscriminate killers.

The truth is Black and Latinx neighborhoods have seen higher numbers of unemployment food insecurity and evictions throughout this pandemic. These families have been left behind by our government for decades and COVID-19 has made it even worse.  https://t.co/RlPY8H2Oxi,2020-10-23 18:30:38,Twitter Web App,1,5,covid; 
Today I learned from small business owners in Hagerstown how they're adapting during COVID-19. Businesses like these are the backbone of our economy. It’s time for the President and the Senate to quit stalling and support these entrepreneurs. https://t.co/oPWxO83LI1,2020-10-22 21:03:14,Twitter Web App,2,10,covid; 
Many states are being crushed by COVID-19: ND “is leading the nation in new coronavirus cases per capita hospitalizations and deaths are at a high.“ We’re better than that. Let’s keep it up. Be safe. Follow the experts not ideologues. And wear a mask. https://t.co/1BqkWHMMYN,2020-10-21 16:17:00,Twitter Web App,2,7,covid; corona; 
The opioid crisis doesn’t discriminate. It’s taking lives in every zip code and COVID-19 is only making it worse. Unfortunately there’s no vaccine being developed to end this epidemic. In Congress I’ll continue to work to end this crisis and save lives. https://t.co/nCeGLg2JGT,2020-10-18 15:07:10,Twitter Web App,1,4,covid; 
COVID-19 combined with the Trump administration’s attempts to gut healthcare means it’s more important now than ever to ensure that rural communities have access to the life-saving treatments they need. https://t.co/KI0VLolg1C,2020-10-16 16:42:32,Twitter Web App,1,1,covid; 
The President postponing COVID relief until after the election is wrong and hurts Maryland families. I’m happy to see Gov. Hogan agree with me that the administration should act now to help families and businesses suffering through no fault of their own.  https://t.co/rLFuS74RHB,2020-10-07 20:11:03,Twitter Web App,2,6,covid; 
Over 20 million Americans are going hungry every week and the number will increase as COVID-19 continues to take its toll on our country and our economy. Many of these families rely on federal benefits to keep food on the table. https://t.co/qX9nrzsrOc,2020-10-05 15:45:38,Twitter Web App,2,4,covid; 
Overdose deaths are up 50% in Western Maryland during COVID-19. These numbers represent real people -- family friends neighbors and colleagues. There is much more work to do to end this crisis. https://t.co/k3qXpmlYJA,2020-09-25 23:47:42,Twitter for iPhone,1,5,covid; 
200000 dead. We should never have come close to this grave milestone. President Trump's total incompetence and utter lack of compassion when it comes to leading our country through the COVID-19 pandemic is sickening.  https://t.co/AbL63wSL8y,2020-09-22 15:57:43,Twitter for iPhone,5,11,covid; 
Now the President blames COVID-19 deaths in "blue states" like Maryland for making him look bad. To him the statistics and his politics are more important than those lives. https://t.co/aUfOcq4UBT,2020-09-17 12:52:54,Twitter Web App,4,8,covid; 
Our first responders have been fighting two public health crises recently: the COVID-19 pandemic and the opioid epidemic. Their dedication to public health and safety is critical to keeping our communities safe.  https://t.co/XydTIm9Qtl,2020-09-08 22:50:14,Twitter Web App,1,4,covid; 
Shockingly the Trump administration is taking away rather than investing in health safety – all while they push to open schools. Protecting students and educators from COVID-19 is key to opening schools safely. They need to get their priorities straight. https://t.co/Ubj09C7Ivg,2020-09-03 21:36:22,Twitter Web App,2,2,covid; 
.@JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris are the winning team we need to move America forward.

Last weekend Team Trone joined Brothers Academy and various other community organizations to distribute food to over 1000 MoCo families in need. So many families are struggling during the COVID-19 pandemic and the Brothers stepped up and served when they saw a need. https://t.co/nNg8ARsqBD,2020-07-17 14:59:56,Twitter for iPhone,1,3,covid; 
One thing I learned in business and in Congress is that good leaders turn to the experts for advice. Dr. Fauci has proven over his decades of service that his expertise is critical to our advances in medical research and responses to crises like COVID-19. https://t.co/GyagrCWnwD,2020-07-15 14:04:00,Twitter for iPhone,1,11,covid; 
Access to reliable internet is critical to families in the 6th District and the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted this need even more.

LGBTQ+ youth are at a higher risk for mental health problems and suicide housing and employment discrimination and violence. These statistics are even more alarming for LGBTQ+ people of color and the COVID-19 pandemic has only made this problem worse.,2020-06-23 16:21:09,Twitter for iPhone,3,6,covid; 
This was no joke. While thousands of people are still dying from COVID-19 the President stood up and bragged about slowing down testing. This behavior is shameless and dangerous. We need leaders focused on public health not cheers at a rally.  https://t.co/T4hBLr28bM,2020-06-21 18:07:05,Twitter for iPhone,1,8,covid;
