OK for sure COVID is raging out of control and Trump is plotting a coup against democracy itself. Q: How to stay sane while we fight for justice?

My crystal ball is spinning. 🔮   Trump’s epic failure to handle COVID and his belligerence will lead to a blue wave not only in MI but in one or several states like OH NC GA FL TX and AZ. His losses will correlate to COVID to some extent.   Dems take the Senate 52+ seats.,2020-11-03 14:55:24,Twitter for iPhone,5,32,covid; 
Thank you @JoeBiden for pointing out that we passed a COVID relief plan in the House of Representatives in May and have been ready and willing to negotiate. We’re not the ones who waited until the election was looming...  #Debate2020,2020-10-23 02:02:51,Twitter Web App,8,67,covid; 
It’s so hard to comprehend the scope of economic destruction COVID + Trump’s mishandling of it have wrought.   “The economy has nearly 11M fewer jobs than it did before the pandemic a bigger loss than the 8.7M at the depth of” the Great Recession.  https://t.co/cXvuG5rntY,2020-10-05 18:03:09,Twitter for iPhone,5,7,covid;

We have just reached the grim milestone of 200000 precious lives lost to this pandemic. This week also marks the beginning of early voting in MI.

What a slap in the face to the nearly 7000 Michigan families who have lost a loved one to COVID-19 for Trump to break the law gather a large group with no social distancing and scream at our Governor to "Open up your state." https://t.co/9WU6OVfcGQ,2020-09-11 02:05:11,Twitter Web App,22,71,covid;

The U.S. has been hit harder by COVID-19 because of conscious decisions by @realDonaldTrump to not do more to fight it.  120000 Americans are dead. Don't let anyone tell you this was inevitable.   He made it this way &amp; he's proud of it. https://t.co/23VRYnArQt,2020-06-21 16:35:29,Twitter for iPhone,7,10,covid; 
Pence better not stand in front of Macomb workers and claim that this admin did not roll over for the Chinese government on trade and COVID-19 for a corrupt deal to solicit foreign interference on behalf of this campaign. Macomb knows better and we’ll prove that in November.,2020-06-18 15:44:36,Twitter Web App,0,3,covid; 
Pence can stand in front of workers in Macomb today and ask them to remember the pre-COVID economy but the numbers don’t lie. Yesterday we learned our state has experienced unemployment over 20% for the second straight month.,2020-06-18 15:41:34,Twitter Web App,1,13,covid; 
We’re experiencing the worst unemployment since the Great Depression all because Trump failed to prepare for this COVID-19 crisis and created a fragile economy that was especially vulnerable to a downturn.   https://t.co/Knf5yar2lH,2020-06-10 15:45:44,Twitter Web App,3,5,covid;

We continue to see a rise in unemployment gaps in meeting basic services (like food and clean water) and an increase in racial inequity around COVID. It’s clear we need structural change now because “inequality is America’s pre-existing condition.” https://t.co/jASFloEpsS,2020-04-30 18:08:43,Twitter Web App,1,1,covid;
