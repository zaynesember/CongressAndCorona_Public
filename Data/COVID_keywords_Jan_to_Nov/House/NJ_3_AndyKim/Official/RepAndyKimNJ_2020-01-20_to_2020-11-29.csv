When we're in the middle of a national crisis it's important to know its impact. I spoke with Secretary Azar today during our hearing of @COVIDoversight and asked him how many Americans have lost their health care coverage due to the pandemic. The answer was simply insufficient. https://t.co/HK0b7DsC0w,2020-10-02 18:32:42,Twitter Media Studio,25,54,covid;

Yesterday we hit two important milestones in our fight against COVID-19: 200000 deaths nationwide and 200000 cases in New Jersey. We're still in the middle of this crisis but we also know that a potential second wave isn't far behind. (thread),2020-09-22 12:43:09,TweetDeck,25,34,covid; 
Transparency leads to trust and when it comes to securing a vaccine for the coronavirus trust is absolutely critical. These companies should be applauded for their efforts and more should follow their lead. https://t.co/phZtFkvQeb,2020-09-18 18:02:00,TweetDeck,4,12,corona;

The coronavirus pandemic has hit working people hard. If you're a nurse saving lives a first responder keeping people safe a food service worker or grocery worker keeping food on the table you've been put at risk.

ICYMI: I wanted to share with you my second line of questioning with @stevenmnuchin1 at yesterday's hearing of @COVIDOversight.

I want to thank @stevenmnuchin1 for coming and testifying before the @COVIDOversight committee today. As you'll see in my first line of questions there's one thing I hope he left with: an understanding that a recovery only for those at the very top isn't good enough. https://t.co/aY3pTEiJa8,2020-09-01 19:52:06,Twitter Media Studio,10,31,covid;

ICYMI - yesterday I called on the Administration to set a nationwide standard to return COVID tests around within 72 hours. No one should have to wait a week or more to get their results. https://t.co/tM5c60qdxL,2020-08-04 15:41:00,TweetDeck,4,18,covid; 
Earlier today I joined MSNBC to call for a national standard for COVID-19 diagnostic test results to be returned within 72 hours. As I've heard from so many of you we're not even close to having results for everyone completed and returned within 72 hours. https://t.co/xIaaRzDofo,2020-08-03 18:11:54,Twitter Media Studio,19,44,covid;

Tomorrow's @COVIDOversight briefing comes at a critical point in our fight against this virus - we've either learned from the mistakes of the past months and we're ready to handle the massive surges we're seeing or we're in for some tough days ahead. https://t.co/d3SQImWC4y,2020-07-01 22:38:06,TweetDeck,6,10,covid; 
Earlier today I joined @MSNBC to talk about the next steps to support our small businesses during the Coronavirus crisis.

At today's hearing by @COVIDOversight I asked the head of the GAO if they know how much remains in our Strategic National Stockpile. I couldn't get a straight answer and that's simply unacceptable. https://t.co/I8snqfJYMM,2020-06-26 17:44:57,Twitter Media Studio,12,31,covid; 
We knew this was coming but it is still shocking to see a President during a pandemic put more energy into repealing health care than in trying to stop this surge in Coronavirus cases. https://t.co/0AfjW0YkVO,2020-06-26 12:37:00,TweetDeck,29,62,corona;
