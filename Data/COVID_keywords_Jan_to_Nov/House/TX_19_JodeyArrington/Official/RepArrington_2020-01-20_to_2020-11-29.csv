GREAT NEWS!   @realDonaldTrump admin’s public-private partnership is paying off.  “Operation Warp Speed” delivers vaccine w/ 95% effectiveness in preventing COVID19... &amp; doesn’t need super cold storage.  Bio-Tech company Moderna says 20 mil doses on the way by end of the year. https://t.co/Fkk4906QSh,2020-11-16 13:36:53,Twitter for iPhone,5,26,covid; 
If we shutdown our entire economy in the name of managing the spread we will unleash economic and public health hell on our citizens.    More of our fellow Americans will die from suicide overdose and deferred treatment than Covid related symptoms. (1/2) https://t.co/2CPi1qyCdc,2020-11-12 19:03:38,Twitter for iPhone,41,71,covid; 
Biden’s COVID advisor recommends a shutdown of our entire country.   That’s the most disconnected and absurd idea I’ve heard since the Democrat Leadership opposed travel restrictions from China. (1/2) https://t.co/tuA8sELRHr,2020-11-12 02:24:09,Twitter for iPhone,10,31,covid; 
All legally cast votes should be counted.  We opened this election up to fraud when we allowed so many flexibilities for COVID.   That doesn't mean there is mass fraud but it does mean we must give confidence and assurance back to the voters by further examining this.

Pelosi &amp; Democrat Leadership chose as our last votes to condemn Qanon conspiracy theorists &amp; the use of ‘Wuhan Virus’.   Not once in over 100 days of violence have they even mentioned Antifa &amp; the Leftist mob assaulting police destroying our cities &amp; terrorizing our citizens. https://t.co/bjg5q3AKpd,2020-10-12 15:51:47,Twitter for iPhone,2,10,wuhan virus;

The worst thing we could do is go back to a shutdown that impacts not only our economy but our health &amp; safety greater than COVID ever could.  As long as we don't inundate our healthcare system this is part of the new risk we must manage b/c it's not going away anytime soon. https://t.co/g8cG7FW8i2,2020-06-26 13:01:34,Twitter Web App,5,19,covid;
