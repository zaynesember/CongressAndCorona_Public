220K Americans have died &amp; 8.4M have contracted #COVID19 on your watch Mr. President. You’re committed to destroying the ACA but your plan to protect the 26M Americans you would leave without care is...what exactly?  Where have I heard this before...? 🤔 https://t.co/xr14d7kcNO,2020-10-22 18:20:22,Twitter for iPhone,6,11,covid; 
Day 15: My kids went to public school in #PA07 so I understand how important it is for our schools &amp; teachers to be well-funded.   When #COVID19 hit I made securing relief for our schools a priority. I'd want that for my family. I demand it for yours.  https://t.co/7kEPnrBMhH,2020-10-19 22:54:35,Twitter for iPhone,2,5,covid; 
Day #20: I work hard for #PA07 working families.   I've heard over &amp; over again how #COVID19 has affected parents juggling remote learning. That's why I wrote a bipartisan bill (it passed the House!) to give families safe practical options for child care. https://t.co/FvIRLqOOrw,2020-10-14 23:18:31,Twitter for iPhone,11,11,covid; 
Day #21: #COVID19 devastated our local restaurant scene &amp; I knew they needed direct support to keep their doors open.

Day #22: I'm working to keep our kids fed.  On the @EdLaborCmte I always prioritize expanding free &amp; reduced lunch programs.  When COVID hit I knew we had to do more. I'm proud of the work my colleagues &amp; I did to expand school meals during this crisis.  https://t.co/Mj63SZ6Z2M,2020-10-12 23:44:23,Twitter for iPhone,7,5,covid;

Even before #COVID19 there was a child care crisis in this country. I saw the tough decisions that #PA07 working families were making about child care &amp; I knew something had to be done. Child care shouldn’t be a political issue.  https://t.co/FvIRLqOOrw,2020-09-21 15:08:42,Twitter for iPhone,6,8,covid;

Paid sick leave is a matter of public health.   We did our job in the House — we passed legislation to keep workers and members of the public safe. The Senate didn’t do theirs.  We can’t afford partisan politics while we work to combat #COVID19. https://t.co/1V09cT04Rt,2020-03-12 17:43:27,Twitter for iPhone,5,13,covid;
