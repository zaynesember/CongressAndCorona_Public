The weather today was absolutely terrific.  You can always count on me to put #CentralArkansas first.

"I am thankful to have an advocate in Washington for our schools and for our kids. That advocate is French Hill.  French has fought for our students and our teachers especially during the COVID era.  Please join me in voting for French Hill for Congress."  -Susan Cottle https://t.co/NsK7EkbIYc,2020-10-30 15:56:49,Twitter for Android,1,6,covid; 
If we want to rebuild our economy if we want to defeat #COVID19 if we want to restore our country I am the best person to represent you and your family.

Liberal Super PACs are lying about French Hill’s record in Congress.  French has always put #CentralArkansas first and always will.  Don’t let dark money groups distort French’s support of #COVID19 relief cutting taxes for middle-class families and accountability in government. https://t.co/2vynnsXmBS,2020-10-27 18:56:23,Twitter for Android,2,8,covid;

Great visiting @EverettFord12 Everett Chevrolet and @EverettINFINITI this afternoon in #Benton.

Proud to have the endorsement of my friend Governor @AsaHutchinson. When COVID-19 hit we both went to work fighting to keep Arkansans safe and provide relief for families and workers.
