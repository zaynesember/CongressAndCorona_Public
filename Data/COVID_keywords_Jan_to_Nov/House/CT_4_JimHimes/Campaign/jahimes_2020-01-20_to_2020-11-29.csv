2020 has been a really tough year. So it’s been a huge relief these last two nights to learn that Covid has been licked the economy is roaring and peace has been achieved in the Middle East. #RepublicanConvention2020,2020-08-26 02:41:46,Twitter for iPhone,42,312,covid;

My little sis is a doc in Pittsburgh tough as nails. She just reached out: “I have always handled crises in hospital but this is hard.”  We don’t ask for help in the Himes family.
