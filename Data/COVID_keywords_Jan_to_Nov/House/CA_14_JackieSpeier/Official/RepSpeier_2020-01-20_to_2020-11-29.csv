This is the result of social media platforms allowing people from the President to average citizens to spread conspiracy theories disinformation &amp; lies online for years almost entirely unchecked. &amp; the danger isn’t confined only to COVID. https://t.co/ehkimT4Zob,2020-11-16 23:37:05,Twitter Web App,37,159,covid; 
.@POTUS hasn’t attended a coronavirus task force meeting for 5 months. America hit a record 184000 infections &amp; over 1400 deaths on Friday. His failure to act has &amp; will continue to cost lives. Those who have enabled his cowardice &amp; incompetence are complicit in those deaths. https://t.co/KCj1vATBKu,2020-11-15 22:50:57,Twitter for iPhone,120,407,corona; 
5 U.S. servicemembers were killed in a helicopter crash in Egypt yesterday. President-elect Biden acknowledged the loss. President Trump hasn't said a word. Our country troops hard-working Americans seniors children frontline COVID workers &amp; more deserve better.,2020-11-13 17:05:52,Twitter for iPhone,445,1696,covid; 
With Vice President-elect Kamala Harris making history at his side we can now focus on arresting the deadly and disastrous march of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Bravo to San Francisco &amp; @LondonBreed for leading the way for the country in recognizing the value of science medicine &amp; facts in combating COVID.

80% forced out of work last month were women. 1 in 5 working-age adults is unemployed because COVID-19 upended #childcare w/women 3x more likely than men to stay home w/the kids. The House passed the #HEROESAct to help working moms. What's the Senate waiting for?! #momsbailout,2020-10-22 18:54:01,Twitter Web App,73,219,covid; 
How is this a democracy when we eliminate 21000 polling places across the country heading into Election Day? It may be harder to vote than get a COVID test on November 3. https://t.co/rvpa0XK1hV via @vice,2020-10-22 18:02:14,Twitter Web App,86,251,covid; 
.@POTUS’s Dr. Atlas heading the coronavirus task force is blocked on Twitter for denying the effectiveness of masks. He will probably say bleach works very well. He is as reckless as POTUS and as ignorant.,2020-10-19 23:51:52,Twitter Web App,313,1236,corona; 
Senator Kamala Harris is right! People are scared that the ACA will be overturned and 7 million Americans who have contracted COVID-19 will have preexisting conditions and can be rejected by insurers. That's what this Supreme Court appointment is all about.,2020-10-13 23:08:16,Twitter Web App,175,576,covid; 
“A slaughter”—a frightening description by an esteemed epidemiologist and former CDC official of the US response to the COVID 19 pandemic. We have no plan! We need a mandatory mask wearing policy now.  https://t.co/UwOsFnZ9Dn,2020-10-07 15:10:20,Twitter for iPhone,107,263,covid; 
The nation’s most senior military leadership are now isolating due to coronavirus exposure.

Were they wearing masks?   https://t.co/yaVxmC31KE,2020-10-06 20:27:29,Twitter Web App,81,220,corona; 
Think about athletes’ behavior when they are on steroids and then look at the President’s behavior. He is not making sound decisions. He has full blown Covid leaves the hospital and takes his mask off for a photo op. Not to mention he has now contaminated the entire White House.,2020-10-05 23:46:33,Twitter Web App,137,457,covid; 
While @POTUS is taking a joyride around Walter Reed to wave at his adoring fans like a king I’m pleased to see him wearing a mask. Now that he knows the dangers of covid personally we must demand he imposes a national mask mandate. It will prevent 60000 deaths by year's end.,2020-10-04 23:25:52,Twitter for iPhone,108,499,covid; 
.@POTUS is showing his despicable side once again. A drug test? The only tests POTUS should be focused on are the millions of COVID tests still needed 8 months after this epidemic started and after more than 200000 Americans have died!!,2020-09-29 15:25:28,Twitter for iPhone,173,722,covid; 
POTUS plans to name a SCOTUS nominee Friday - a week after RBG’s death - yet we’ve been waiting 9 months for a national testing and tracing plan PPE and COVID relief. Imagine if the President cared about anyone other than himself? Meanwhile 200000 Americans have died,2020-09-21 20:13:10,Twitter Web App,485,1234,covid; 
America is strongest when it embraces diversity &amp; inclusion but @realDonaldTrump's #antiAsian rhetoric &amp; scapegoating during COVID-19 recalls America’s worst moral failures. Today I proudly voted for #HRes908 to denounce xenophobia &amp; intolerance against #AAPI communities! https://t.co/EQTRJ68ZW8,2020-09-18 01:04:20,Twitter for iPhone,12,55,covid; 
.@POTUS - viewing historic fire devastation in CA- said it will get colder. Is he using the arrival of fall to pretend climate change-like COVID-will just vanish? Does he know Gingrich beat him to that con in 2009 when he declared it was snowing so there was no global warming?,2020-09-15 12:52:31,Twitter for iPhone,87,391,covid; 
Trump’s go-to strategy as President has been denying facts and amplifying and weaponizing conspiracy theories. He hid the truth about Covid because he’s more concerned with his own political harm than the physical harm of millions of Americans. #TrumpKnew https://t.co/KRdZZw10ID,2020-09-10 15:02:52,Twitter Web App,85,170,covid; 
The #caregiver crisis is hitting women &amp; their families hard across the country &amp; in my District. We've gone from 850 childcare providers to 240 in San Mateo!

I remember struggling as a pregnant widow with 1 child to care for &amp; 1 on the way while serving in the CA legislature. It was the toughest time in my life. Now @BuffyWicks &amp; millions more women are battling a new COVID #caregivercrisis. They deserve a meaningful federal response!,2020-09-09 19:18:05,Twitter Web App,41,254,covid; 
It's malfeasance for @POTUS to admit he knew COVID was deadly but put on a happy face telling the American public "it’s like a miracle it will disappear.” He did it for one reason - to prop up the stock market &amp; his reelection. Now 190000 dead Americans tell a different story. https://t.co/HzaTkoe98q,2020-09-09 17:23:49,Twitter Web App,106,271,covid;

How out of touch is @POTUS? Rent’s due &amp; 40M+ are facing eviction. POC 2x likely to be renters. 20M ppl live in homes hit by COVID job loss. Food pantry requests up 2000%. His solution. Do a study! Let’s move the evicted to Mar-a-Lago where taxpayers are renting rooms already.,2020-09-01 20:54:57,Twitter for iPhone,82,299,covid; 
Trump wants to erase any visual reminder that COVID continues to devastate us &amp; our economy. Masks an integral tool to suppress infections are also a reminder to him of his failure. His vanity and narcissism can’t handle the sight of masks even if it means that 1000s die.,2020-08-28 21:30:44,Twitter Web App,163,526,covid; 
The CDC is STILL not calling for testing of plp exposed to COVID – something Dr. Fauci &amp; other experts made clear is key to stopping the virus. It’s chilling that CDC may have changed guidance due to pressure “from the top” potentially risking lives. Congress must investigate.,2020-08-27 21:49:24,Twitter Web App,116,397,covid; 
It’s gotta be hard for @POTUS to look at the only numbers he cares about the TV ratings and see how dismal his convention is doing. I wish he cared more about the COVID-19 numbers. But that wouldn’t be about him. https://t.co/NFsKUYt4A3,2020-08-27 20:14:49,Twitter Web App,66,223,covid;

Remember this the $25 billion in the #USPS bill was requested by the TRUMP-APPOINTED Board of Governors of the Postal Service. The coronavirus has wreaked havoc on the system.,2020-08-22 18:35:38,Twitter for iPhone,101,304,corona; 
Due to the pandemic Americans depend more than ever on the USPS for safe access to prescriptions Social Security checks paychecks tax returns &amp; absentee ballots during the COVID-19 pandemic yet DeJoy &amp; @POTUS have launched a campaign to gut this public service from Day One. https://t.co/tEIwvdffDW,2020-08-18 22:17:04,Twitter for iPhone,18,53,covid; 
By the way Mr. President suburban moms are concerned about sending their kids to school when COVID is still rampant. You can’t force them to do that. Kids DO come first not you.,2020-08-12 15:16:13,Twitter Web App,106,523,covid; 
Contact tracing via mobile apps can play a key role in combating rising coronavirus cases but only if people trust the safety of their data.

One American per minute is dying in the U.S. due to the coronavirus. Let that sink in. Remember when @POTUS said there were only 15 cases in the U.S. and it would magically go away?

We now have a member who tested positive for COVID-19 doesn’t wear a mask &amp; but for the fact he was going to fly with POTUS he wouldn’t have been tested.

Only @POTUS and his family of grifters would be so tone deaf to spin job loss along with loss of health insurance &amp; possibly your home amid a global pandemic as a career reset.

It took 4 weeks for the U.S. to jump from 2M COVID-19 infections to 3M.
