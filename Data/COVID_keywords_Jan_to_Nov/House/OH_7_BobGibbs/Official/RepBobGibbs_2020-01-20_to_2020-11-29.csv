Unbelievable. @SpeakerPelosi would rather pass nothing-and let those still struggling twist in the wind-than pass even extensions of programs we previously passed. This was never about COVID relief. It was only about political posturing for the election. https://t.co/2Yc6InfDsL,2020-10-01 16:50:58,Twitter Web App,2,9,covid; 
The President's actions to restrict travel from China in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic saved lives. Now Democrats want to limit that authority and make it more difficult to keep America safe with the irresponsible #NoBanAct https://t.co/LpBNaiRtEz,2020-07-22 18:10:08,Twitter Web App,59,122,corona; 
.@RepMarcyKaptur &amp; I worked together to introduce bipartisan bill helping hospitals &amp; healthcare providers to forgive loans made preparing for #COVID19 pandemic. Those on #COVID19 front lines need back-up! https://t.co/SxGaU6zks9,2020-06-22 17:07:37,Twitter Web App,7,13,covid;

Thank you to @RepConorLamb for joining me to spearhead this bipartisan effort. Transportation infrastructure is truly essential funding shortfalls from #COVID19 will leave state DOTs with budget deficits &amp; unfunded incomplete or abandoned infrastructure improvement projects. https://t.co/hUw7OPSSjm,2020-05-13 12:30:03,TweetDeck,2,3,covid; 
State DOTs rely so much on fuel taxes and tolls. When the nation begins returning to normal and surface transportation traffic returns to pre-coronavirus levels the reduction in revenue may leave important projects incomplete or unfunded without a boost. https://t.co/ZIad2Hdqvz,2020-05-13 12:01:39,TweetDeck,5,17,corona;

THREE of which were created by the CARES Act specifically for coronavirus oversight. @SpeakerPelosi's goal isn't oversight it is extracting political capital out of a public health crisis. https://t.co/3SU1iSmxjB,2020-04-23 20:47:10,TweetDeck,23,41,corona;

This should surprise no one. It's why I signed on to support @RepJimBanks' resolution calling China out for among many things: denying COVID19's person-to-person transmission capability &amp; waging an outrageous &amp; false propaganda war that blames the US for creating the virus. https://t.co/UkDot74K26,2020-04-01 12:22:34,TweetDeck,688,745,covid; 
It is incumbent upon Congress to support those fighting to stop the spread of the coronavirus &amp; the millions of Americans suffering from loss of work. The CARES Act does exactly that.,2020-03-27 17:56:47,Twitter Web App,1,3,corona; 
The CARES Act is a critical phase 3 in the federal response to the coronavirus outbreak. By beefing up funding directly to hospitals they can ramp up the capacity to diagnose and treat patients.,2020-03-27 17:56:47,Twitter Web App,10,26,corona; 
A #coronavirus side effect you might not have considered: Canceled blood drives &amp; fewer blood donations.

It should be as simple as passing bipartisan legislation to provide relief for those affected by #Coronavirus. But Nancy Pelosi has been wasting time trying to stuff a relief bill w/ items from liberal wish lists.
