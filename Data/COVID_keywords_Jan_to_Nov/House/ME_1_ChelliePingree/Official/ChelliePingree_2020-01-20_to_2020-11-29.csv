STARTING TODAY: In an effort to stop the spread of #COVID19 everyone in Maine must now wear a face covering in public settings. Here are some Maine-themed masks I made for my family and friends today 🦞⛵️ https://t.co/LI7YxdUhRo,2020-05-01 17:34:05,Twitter Web App,19,150,covid; 
With income and sales tax revenues drastically reduced due to #COVID19 Maine is facing its biggest shortfall in three decades. I've cosponsored H.R. 6592 to allocate $500B to state and local governments and give state officials flexibility to fill in revenue gaps. #mepolitics https://t.co/5sKMwK7HVz,2020-04-27 17:42:13,Twitter Web App,15,46,covid; 
As of tonight 50k+ Americans have died from the coronavirus 47 Mainers among them. Let us mourn them as people not numbers. They were neighbors parents children siblings friends. We can honor them by doing our part to stay home and preventing the spread of this disease.,2020-04-24 21:58:54,Twitter for iPhone,11,88,corona; 
The Payroll Guarantee Act which takes a similar approach to #COVID19 relief policies in the United Kingdom Netherlands Ireland France Germany Denmark &amp; Australia would cover 100% of wages for workers and maintain their employer-sponsored benefits. https://t.co/tyCdgogxzc,2020-04-23 21:39:47,Twitter Web App,0,4,covid; 
In the next #COVID19 package Congress needs to fix PPP’s structural deficiencies &amp; consider a different model for maintaining the livelihoods of workers &amp; small businesses. That's why I’ve cosponsored the Payroll Guarantee Act to provide immediate direct cash support to workers.,2020-04-23 21:33:42,Twitter Web App,2,5,covid; 
This #COVID19 funding package will help small businesses keep employees but it is far from sufficient. For tens of thousands of Mainers who’ve lost their income a one-time stimulus check is not enough to address the bills that are still arriving on time. #mepolitics,2020-04-23 21:30:43,Twitter Web App,2,4,covid; 
While I am glad this #COVID19 package will now allow small farmers to take advantage of the Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) program and help community-based banks to lend it does not address the structural problems with the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP).,2020-04-23 21:29:50,Twitter Web App,1,3,covid; 
Widespread testing is the best possible way to get Mainers back to work and help our economy rebound. H.R. 266 will require the Trump admin to finally develop a national testing strategy and provide $25 billion for states to expand their #COVID19 testing capacity.,2020-04-23 21:21:09,Twitter Web App,1,8,covid; 
The House is voting on the next #COVID19 relief package in waves to adhere to CDC's distancing guidance.

It's appalling that Trump is using a deadly pandemic to advance a hateful bigoted agenda.

#COVID19 has put a strain on every state’s health care system.

We're already overwhelmed with demand for equipment like N95 masks which protect health care workers treating this pandemic.  I've joined 57 House colleagues to demand Trump ramp up production of protective medical equipment.

The Senate must take up this legislation immediately. I hope the President follows through on his tweet saying he supports H.R. 6201 and will sign the House-passed bill so we can begin to ease some of the hardship caused by the #coronavirus outbreak.,2020-03-14 16:42:30,Twitter Web App,7,21,corona;

BREAKING: @USDA has approved Maine's school meals waiver to prevent kids from going hungry during the #coronavirus outbreak.   As schools take precautions to prevent exposure to #COVID19 it’s vital that states have flexibility to continue providing meals to students off-site. https://t.co/CxU6atwgHV,2020-03-11 19:01:47,Twitter Web App,1,2,covid; corona; 
Many states including Maine have asked @USDA for a waiver so that there's flexibility to serve schools meals off-site amid the #coronavirus outbreak. In today’s @AppropsDems hearing @SecretarySonny told me “the answer is yes”—USDA will approve all filed waivers. #mepolitics https://t.co/x1HhRnllDb,2020-03-10 19:30:12,Twitter Media Studio,25,88,corona;

Last week I worked w/ my @AppropsDems colleagues to advance a $8.3B emergency #coronavirus response package. The bill passed the House and Senate w/ bipartisan support. It will invest millions in state+local public health agencies and $3B toward the development of a vaccine.,2020-03-09 17:02:21,Twitter Web App,5,9,corona;

According to the @CDCgov symptoms of #COVID19 can appear 2-14 days after exposure and can include fever cough and shortness of breath. If you develop symptoms or have recently traveled to an area experiencing a COVID-19 outbreak call your doctor.,2020-03-09 17:00:16,Twitter Web App,1,5,covid;

Proud to have worked with my @AppropsDems colleagues to advance a bipartisan bicameral #coronavirus funding plan that starts to address the scale of this public health crisis and backfills $37M stolen from LIHEAP by the Trump admin. #mepolitics https://t.co/v7p97ftI0K,2020-03-04 20:55:54,Twitter Web App,3,10,corona; 
I've joined 60 of my colleagues in demanding POTUS establish a strong chain of command for the govt’s #coronavirus response. The Trump admin’s poor organization spread of bad information and request for budget cuts do not demonstrate that a clear strategy is being executed. https://t.co/uNUJj3oibg,2020-03-04 18:37:32,Twitter for iPhone,10,32,corona; 
Worth noting: taxpayer money will be directed toward the creation of a #coronavirus vaccine. https://t.co/tPPnckNmdt,2020-03-03 20:30:36,Twitter Web App,35,59,corona; 
@GovJanetMills @AppropsDems @CDCgov The bottom line is that we need a fully-funded coordinated government response to confront the COVID-19 epidemic.,2020-03-02 23:54:32,Twitter Web App,2,5,covid; 
@GovJanetMills @AppropsDems @CDCgov After the Ebola outbreak of 2015 federal pandemic response teams were established and the Trump Administration eliminated them as a cost-saving measure. This shortsighted approach has put our nation at a significant disadvantage in handling the global spread of COVID-19.,2020-03-02 23:53:18,Twitter Web App,3,7,covid; 
@GovJanetMills @AppropsDems @CDCgov When the coronavirus vaccine is finally developed it should be affordable to people across income levels and widely available.,2020-03-02 23:52:25,Twitter Web App,1,3,corona; 
@GovJanetMills @AppropsDems @CDCgov I'm extremely troubled by reports about the high costs incurred by people who’ve done the right thing + proactively been tested for coronavirus. These costs could deter people who’ve been exposed to this highly contagious virus from getting care and further spread the virus.,2020-03-02 23:51:18,Twitter Web App,1,4,corona; 
@GovJanetMills @AppropsDems The @CDCgov and Maine CDC are encouraging all of us to take preventive action to stop the spread of coronavirus. From washing our hands and not touching our faces to staying home when you’re sick if you’re able we all should be vigilant about our individual hygiene.,2020-03-02 23:49:34,Twitter Web App,0,3,corona; 
@GovJanetMills @AppropsDems Last week I met with Maine CDC Director Dr. Nirav Shah to discuss our coordinated response to the global outbreak of COVID-19. We are in frequent discussions about the state’s progress around prevention and test kit availability as well as other critical health supplies.,2020-03-02 23:48:50,Twitter Web App,0,3,covid; 
@GovJanetMills At the federal level I am working with my @AppropsDems  colleagues to advance a significant funding package that addresses the coronavirus epidemic at the federal state and local levels without taking funds from essential existing programs as President Trump has proposed.,2020-03-02 23:47:46,Twitter Web App,0,5,corona; 
I applaud @GovJanetMills for proactively assembling a Coronavirus Response Team. Although Maine does not currently have any confirmed cases of coronavirus it is critical that Maine has the resources and coordination in place to respond effectively. https://t.co/BT0Db0sHJj,2020-03-02 23:46:44,Twitter Web Client,7,57,corona; 
Trump has long underprioritized CDC leaving gov w/o resources + leadership to handle #coronavirus. Now he wants to steal heating assistance $ from 750k families to make up for his poor planning. I've joined @joekennedy + @PeterWelch in asking Congress to restore essential funds. https://t.co/iG27hQWzr6,2020-02-27 22:12:57,Twitter for iPhone,36,71,corona;
