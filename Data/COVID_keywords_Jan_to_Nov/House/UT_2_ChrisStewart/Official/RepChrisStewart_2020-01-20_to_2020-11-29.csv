What we don't want is to have the number of people affected by COVID-19 to be vastly higher than our healthcare capabilities which is why mitigation &amp; social distancing is so important.   Do your part. Avoid large crowds. Practice good hygiene. And if you're sick stay at home. https://t.co/Ca3gTIA3Qt,2020-03-13 15:41:14,Twitter Web App,10,44,covid;
