As a father &amp; grandfather I couldn't be happier to be joined by @ieanea President Kathi Griffin to announce IEA's endorsement of our campaign. Southern IL is blessed w/ many great teachers who’ve been working tirelessly to educate our kids throughout the COVID-19 shutdown.

I wanted to let our friends and supporters know that Tracy and I continue to do well during our quarantine as we recover from COVID-19. All of our campaign staff that I was in close contact with also tested negative and have no symptoms whatsoever. (1/2),2020-10-17 18:15:56,Twitter for iPhone,2,3,covid; 
While I'm still quarantining at home as I recover from COVID-19 my work doesn't stop. I spoke with Aaron Price from Williamson &amp; Franklin County News today about a variety of issues including how campaigning in 2020 looks a little different than in past years. https://t.co/93q44V3qqC,2020-10-15 20:45:00,Twitter Web App,1,1,covid; 
These essential workers have been on front lines in recent months ensuring passengers and products make it to their final destination safely during the COVID-19 shutdown. They move our nation forward and I'm proud to have their support. (2/2),2020-10-01 15:42:17,Twitter Web App,0,0,covid; 
As a small business owner I’ve seen the impact the COVID-19 shutdown has had on our local businesses with many fighting tooth &amp; nail to survive. I am honored to receive the @USChamber’s endorsement &amp; will continue working to get our Southern IL businesses back on their feet. https://t.co/MvfOgDx3Co,2020-09-28 17:24:42,Twitter for iPhone,1,1,covid; 
This year has been eventful; After China unleashed the pandemic that knocked us off our stride we fought back! While COVID-19 isn’t behind us just yet I'm confident that our best days lie ahead. I'm running for re-election b/c I believe in Southern IL &amp; the values we hold dear. https://t.co/Ipkrx457Gh,2020-09-16 18:00:16,Twitter Web App,5,9,covid; 
As a small business owner I'm honored to announce our campaign has been endorsed by @NFIB.

Looking forward to another great night of the @GOPconvention! Before America was struck with COVID-19 we had record economic growth and more opportunities for all Americans to succeed. Under @POTUS we are seeing economic expansion return and will come back stronger! #RNC2020 https://t.co/I34HN7NHPQ,2020-08-25 22:33:18,Twitter for iPhone,0,0,covid;
