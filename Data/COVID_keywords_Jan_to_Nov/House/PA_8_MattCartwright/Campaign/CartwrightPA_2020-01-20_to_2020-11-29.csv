What a creative way to celebrate #SmallBusinessSaturday! Socially distant outdoor pop-up shops are open on the WB square for the next 2 weeks. A great partnership between @Downtown_WB and Greater Wyoming Valley Chamber in support of our local businesses. https://t.co/xo28M9h9Pe,2020-11-28 17:01:19,Twitter Web App,1,0,socially distant;

Our educators &amp; families are doing everything they can to keep their communities safe while continuing our children's education. We need comprehensive #COVID19 relief to equip them with the PPE &amp; technology needed to teach and learn amid the pandemic.  https://t.co/2ZukI9xE4l,2020-10-23 19:43:42,Twitter Web App,1,1,covid; 
Democrats &amp; Republicans are making progress in COVID relief talks but Mitch McConnell is ruling out any bipartisan deal. Americans know we need another major bill to control the spread of the virus and keep our economy afloat. We have to get this done. https://t.co/hh0OquZ4wB,2020-10-22 14:26:50,Twitter Web App,1,5,covid; 
ICYMI: At last night's debate I hope I showed voters the work I've done to invest in #NEPA. I look forward to moving us forward on a strong response to #COVID19 re-building an economy that works for everyone and strengthening our earned benefits and health care. #PA8Debate https://t.co/qHR5emSEhn,2020-10-19 22:26:00,Twitter Web App,2,8,covid; 
#COVID19 is surging again in PA. We all need to do our part and continue following mask &amp; distancing guidelines but it's also long past time for a national testing/tracing plan to mitigate hot spots. This is how we get our economy safely running again.   https://t.co/g9erEtarTK,2020-10-16 17:08:42,Twitter Web App,3,3,covid; 
To get this pandemic under control and keep it that way we need to manufacture PPE in America not China. I have a plan to advance both our #COVID19 response and our economic recovery. https://t.co/alrKRLjEfv,2020-10-11 20:35:00,Twitter Web App,6,14,covid; 
In this campaign we’re fighting for a better #COVID19 response better health care and an inclusive economic recovery - things that lift us all up. I'm so grateful for all the community leaders in Hazleton who are getting everyone ready to #VoteBlue &amp; help us move NEPA forward! https://t.co/boc4V6YgKV,2020-10-11 17:25:40,Twitter Web App,7,11,covid; 
Teachers go to work everyday &amp; shape the minds of our future leaders caretakers &amp; frontline workers. And during #COVID19 educators have been going above &amp; beyond to care for their students &amp; ensure their academic progress. #WorldTeachersDay https://t.co/BQM0yMR7w8,2020-10-05 20:19:03,Twitter Web App,4,4,covid; 
Helping businesses adapt through #COVID19 is critical and I am proud to have secured millions to support #NEPA businesses' recovery. #SmallBusinessWeek  https://t.co/48htnjGc4J,2020-09-23 12:45:00,Twitter Web App,2,5,covid; 
Small businesses are core to America's story and strength. That's why I have worked in Congress to help #NEPA businesses access #COVID19 relief and create a climate that encourages more companies to set up shop and grow. #SmallBusinessWeek https://t.co/5e7kBvGrKE,2020-09-22 12:13:00,Twitter Web App,3,7,covid; 
Families and businesses are still struggling because of #COVID19 and we must come together to support our community. I am proud to provide $1.43M in federal coronavirus funding to Luzerne County to help #NEPA navigate to better days.  https://t.co/Ewzeuv7OJm,2020-09-13 14:16:57,Twitter for iPhone,3,7,covid; corona; 
Democrats and Republicans need to come together &amp; pass real #COVID19 relief. Our economy is on the line our frontline workers deserve hazard pay &amp; our country needs their elected officials to guide them to better days.

Now on @WILKNewsRadio with Frank Andrews: We need to come together as Americans and keep our economy alive as we fight #COVID19.,2020-09-09 19:54:24,Twitter Web App,2,0,covid; 
Thank you to @SEIUPA workers for their bravery on the frontlines. Our country owes a debt of gratitude to the workers who sacrificed their wellbeing amid #COVID19. I am committed to ensuring our workers receive the hazard pay &amp; safety equipment needed to keep our country healthy. https://t.co/8f0WujHqks,2020-09-06 16:07:08,Twitter Web App,1,2,covid; 
I helped secure a $400K grant for the #NEPA Alliance to ensure small businesses are supported through #COVID19. I know businesses are struggling &amp; I'm committed to working on both sides of the aisle to provide more economic relief for our local economy. https://t.co/5MuAaDY5yg,2020-09-04 12:51:00,TweetDeck,2,2,covid; 
Our restaurants and hospitality workers have been hit hard by #COVID19. I am listening to and supporting #NEPA's restaurants and their employees to help them get through these tough times.   https://t.co/g7bIPo2oec,2020-08-06 23:23:26,Twitter for iPhone,9,9,covid; 
"I am proud to see funds from the CARES Act help small businesses adapt through #COVID19 in #NEPA. Our recovery is on the line right now &amp; I am going to keep fighting for the resources we need to help our struggling communities move into better days." -MC https://t.co/y3ahHd4oO4,2020-08-06 00:00:19,Twitter for iPhone,2,7,covid; 
Doctors and nurses are telling us what we need to keep up a strong pandemic response. I hear them &amp; that's why I'm pushing to:  ✅Boost manufacturing of drugs &amp; PPE in the US ✅Provide more funding for #COVID19 testing resources   https://t.co/8srJ3V82Vo,2020-08-05 16:21:24,Twitter for iPhone,1,2,covid; 
Some relief initiatives for working families struggling during #COVID19 will end in a matter of days including foreclosure protections &amp; enhanced unemployment insurance. But NEPA families are still struggling. They must be extended in the next bill. https://t.co/5jYc9xelig,2020-07-21 22:23:48,Twitter Web App,0,1,covid; 
At a time when cases are surging and testing is backlogged we can’t afford to let up in our fight against #COVID19. This shouldn’t be a partisan issue. I’ll keep pushing for more federal resources to get us through this crisis &amp; move our economy forward. https://t.co/VNmhhzl5xS https://t.co/ZiNnYTZyGH,2020-07-20 19:03:54,Twitter Web App,1,2,covid; 
The economic recovery from COVID-19 is going to take a team effort. I strongly support relief for our community partners who help our local small businesses in good times and in hard times. https://t.co/zt0s4a5ISw,2020-07-17 19:58:34,Twitter Web App,1,2,covid; 
During #COVID19 I’m fighting for relief for American families and small businesses and to make our drugs here in the U.S. – not China. But Jim Bognet? He’d take us backwards and take away health care for millions.   Let’s move America forward. #PA08 https://t.co/w41osWoa6F,2020-07-15 20:45:00,Twitter Web App,4,6,covid; 
#COVID19 has left millions without health insurance. 4 out of 5 are still eligible for coverage because of the #ACA yet the GOP is *still* trying to scrap it!  It's simple: they want to take away your care but I'm fighting to protect it &amp; lower costs. https://t.co/zYGYvKZsXq,2020-07-14 17:00:00,Twitter Web App,0,2,covid; 
.@JoeBiden’s Build Back Better plan would follow through on a commitment to build our future in America and create American jobs. #COVID19 has taught us that making medicines in the US and reducing our dependence on China has to be a part of this too. https://t.co/G8JPe3BWG2,2020-07-11 21:44:03,Twitter Web App,1,3,covid;
