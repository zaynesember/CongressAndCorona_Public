FEMA HHS and the private sector combined have delivered   ✅76.5 million N95 respirators   ✅107.2 million surgical masks  ✅811.9 million gloves  ✅Nearly 11000 ventilators.

The #PaycheckProtectionProgram is just one of the many ways small businesses can get help from the effects of #COVID19. This video from @GOPLeader helps breakdown what other programs are in place to get small businesses and employees back on their feet. https://t.co/FvYGix7yHX,2020-04-27 17:54:38,Twitter Web App,53,156,covid; 
As we face the #COVID19 pandemic we are reminded of just how critical workers are to our supply chain infrastructure. Thank you #ToThoseWhoKeepUsMoving for all of your hard work during this unprecedented crisis. https://t.co/ODcZPUUVLK,2020-04-21 17:01:39,Twitter Web App,12,33,covid; 
The #WHO was dishonest about the coronavirus — echoing and praising the lies disseminating from China.   @realDonaldTrump was right to hold #WHO accountable. The American taxpayers should not prop-up an organization that shows dangerous bias towards the Chinese government.,2020-04-15 15:16:26,Twitter for iPhone,29,99,corona;

Speaker Pelosi Americans need solutions related to COVID-19 not   ❌A $15 minimum wage ❌ Same day voter registration ❌Corporate “diversity &amp; inclusion” budgets.  These unrelated partisan demands are a waste of time while Americans suffer. They need help now.,2020-03-23 19:57:24,Twitter for iPhone,35,75,covid;
