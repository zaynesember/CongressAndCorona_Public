What a disingenuous point. The proper question is: what policies make a difference? There’s no obvious policy to prevent 260000 deaths. And it’s obvious that Dem lockdowns cause more evictions &amp; hunger.   AND you and your Dem Senators blocked COVID relief.   Inconvenient truth. https://t.co/S0lRHl9NmP,2020-11-25 22:42:56,Twitter for iPhone,3405,19402,covid; 
Joe Biden agrees with Speaker Pelosi’s “nothing is better than something” hostage-taking approach to COVID relief - while countless Americans suffer.  Got it. We will fight this every step of the way. https://t.co/XhgTFbeEPJ,2020-11-23 19:07:15,Twitter for iPhone,600,3185,covid; 
Can we just stop with the sensationalist headlines. There isn’t a family in America that isn’t keenly aware of the risks of COVID. Do what is best for your family. https://t.co/JQ3bjZLCrk,2020-11-21 17:44:56,Twitter for iPhone,1158,12226,covid;

This is exactly wrong it’s a lie and MJ Hegar knows it. Senate DEMOCRATS blocked COVID relief packages from being voted on in the Senate.   Every Republican Senator including John Cornyn supported relief. https://t.co/zxxtrakF46 https://t.co/6aCEIYH1k2,2020-10-28 23:46:47,Twitter for iPhone,1291,4105,covid; 
There aren’t COVID “negotiations” there are Dems holding America hostage.  GOP: so we agree on about a TRILLION right?  Pelosi: Yes but add a few trillion for progressive stuff.  GOP: No let’s just vote on what we agree on ok?  Pelosi: Nope. Nothing is better than something. https://t.co/nxM4Vcb7A2,2020-10-26 15:52:08,Twitter for iPhone,2546,8961,covid; 
On COVID Biden has consistently said he would handle COVID better but never says *how.*   Worse he falsely claims he never called China travel restrictions “xenophobic.”  He did. Here.  https://t.co/Pt3gNVfsFS,2020-10-23 16:18:52,Twitter for iPhone,691,3491,covid; 
One of the first votes I took was to protect people with pre-existing conditions in case the ACA was struck down.  Nancy Pelosi - the politician you shamelessly stooge for - blocked that GOP amdt.   Just like she blocked bipartisan COVID relief &amp; you praised her for it.,2020-10-20 20:20:39,Twitter for iPhone,664,3753,covid; 
Let’s debunk the myth of “failed negotiations.” The truth? Pelosi and House Dems believe “nothing is better than something.” There is plenty of COVID relief bills they could put on the floor for a vote that would get signed into law.

Bringing this back up because it’s still true. Pelosi and the Democrats are LYING about the negotiations. She easily could have put multiple COVID relief bills on the House floor that would have gotten bipartisan  support. She refused. https://t.co/9agzCZlsQ2,2020-10-07 02:06:07,Twitter for iPhone,4685,13440,covid; 
The House adjourned today with no deal. That’s the Dem/media line anyway.  This is a lie.  The reality is Pelosi easily could have put a number of high impact bipartisan COVID relief options on the floor that we already agree on.

The latest unemployment rate in New York was 15.9% New Jersey was 13.8% and Pennsylvania was 13.7%.  These three Democrat-run states (even with extended lockdowns) also had high COVID deaths per 100K. (NY - 167.44 NJ - 179.81 PA - 60.98),2020-09-04 22:43:25,Twitter for iPhone,609,2773,covid;

Democrat Convention is an exercise in gaslighting:  Michelle Obama decries kids “thrown in cages” - but Barack Obama built and used them.  Biden is “moderate” - but stumped for by Bernie.

The Democrats’ willingness to lie while simultaneously holding COVID relief hostage (again) is shameless.  The GOP proposal is common sense. We don’t want trial lawyers getting a free pass to sue small businesses as they try to recover. It’s that simple. https://t.co/8GDLKR8eli,2020-08-06 18:09:05,Twitter for iPhone,747,2693,covid; 
Great article. Spot on. Reveals how empty Biden’s accusations really are.  “Can Mr. Biden come up with a single action to fight COVID that Trump hasn’t already done?”  Actually yes. Biden would NOT have restricted travel from China. He called it “xenophobic.” https://t.co/d2nck52QXV,2020-07-23 23:55:13,Twitter for iPhone,823,3292,covid;

For those who keep pushing the false narrative that Houston is out of ICU space because we reached our capacity with COVID patients please stop.
