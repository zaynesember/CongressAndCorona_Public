Supporting small cities and towns shouldn't be a partisan issue –– it’s about beating back this virus and getting back on our feet.  @MayorBarnett President of @usmayors and I advocate for more support to communities fighting COVID-19 in @DetNewsOpinion: https://t.co/DxjvsQjkqk,2020-05-05 17:36:00,Twitter Web App,11,53,covid;

The decision to transition back to work &amp; school should be based on science and facts. We should get back to work in a safe &amp; responsible way as soon as we can.  We should not go back if it risks a second deadly wave of COVID nor should we stay home any longer than necessary.,2020-04-30 22:38:03,Twitter Web App,28,302,covid; 
We have suffered because so much of our medical supply chain is offshore. We are fighting a war against #COVID19 but our armor is made overseas.   We’d never outsource the production of jet fighters or combat boots and the same should go for gloves gowns masks and test swabs.,2020-04-29 20:15:27,Twitter Web App,0,7,covid; 
If we don't allow smaller cities &amp; towns to benefit from federal assistance many could be forced to take drastic action––including laying off the very same personnel working on the front lines of this crisis.

As a national security professional I find it unacceptable that we were so unprepared for #COVID19.
