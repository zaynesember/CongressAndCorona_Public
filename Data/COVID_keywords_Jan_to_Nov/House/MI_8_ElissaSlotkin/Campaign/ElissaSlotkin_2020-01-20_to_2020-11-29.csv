There is no playbook for COVID campaigning. Whether socially distant in your town squares live streamed or on endless Zooms it is my job to make my affirmative case for re-election to the people of this district. Seven more days — let’s leave it all on the field! #MI08 https://t.co/iA34M59o5y,2020-10-27 12:40:43,Twitter Media Studio,37,151,covid; socially distant; 
Any day we wear hardhats is a good day. So we had a good day at Operating Engineers Local 324 in Howell today. They have adapted their spaces to stay safe from COVID-19. Also had an important chat about safety for highway workers: Give 'em a brake and don't drive distracted! https://t.co/M4BrYr7dio,2020-10-23 19:43:56,Twitter Web App,7,58,covid; 
Few know Michigan politics better than @michpoligal - formerly of @freep and now writing for @nytimes - who lays out the challenges of this race without MSU students on campus.

Michigan was hard hit by COVID. Voting against relief puts politics above people and she will not stand for that. #MI08debate https://t.co/XUljFjAIMf,2020-10-06 23:19:33,Twitter Web App,9,38,covid; 
Elissa worked with the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus to break through months of stalled COVID-19 talks and get both parties’ leadership back to the negotiating table because she puts residents of Michigan’s 8th before party politics. #MI08debate https://t.co/gjrE5uh3Ld,2020-10-06 23:15:11,Twitter Web App,8,31,covid; 
In the COVID era reaching voters where they are takes some creativity. Here in Michigan we’re still pumping gas. So we got inventive and are aiming for that captive audience when they’re at the pump. That’s right we’re officially up on gas pump video screens! https://t.co/Hrl2ekcvV2,2020-10-06 12:44:55,Twitter Media Studio,73,405,covid; 
Elissa worked with the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus to present a new COVID relief bill. Her efforts pushed leadership to reverse course &amp; put that bill on the House next week. This is the bipartisan work Elissa is known for. https://t.co/GWIZKpaFnk,2020-09-27 14:14:44,Twitter Web App,17,80,covid; 
The bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus COVID-19 relief plan that Elissa helped introduce pushed House leadership back to the negotiating table. That’s what bipartisan leadership is all about. #MI08debate https://t.co/Xy8hsf0B4d,2020-09-27 14:07:50,Twitter Web App,12,53,covid; 
A member of the Problem Solvers Caucus Elissa worked with Democrats and Republicans to write a bipartisan compromise COVID aid package and she called on her leadership to put getting people the relief they need over partisan politics. #MI08 #MI08debate,2020-09-21 23:26:34,Twitter Web App,13,67,covid; 
In Washington this week I stood up with Democrats and Republicans to push for a bipartisan COVID relief package.

The first TV ads of our campaign focus on the positive case I’m making and the fight to protect health care workers fighting COVID-19. My opponent…well he’s taking another path.,2020-09-01 16:58:53,Twitter Web App,23,76,covid; 
The shop’s tools include a sanitization spray gun purchased from a paint company in Howell! This has got to be the most fun you can have stopping the spread of COVID-19. https://t.co/k9MfcKqC4o,2020-08-31 15:28:27,Twitter Web App,4,26,covid; 
One of the coolest things we saw on Saturday while visiting businesses in Brighton was at @Londonbeautykat which is weathering COVID as a relatively new business selling American-made beauty supplies. https://t.co/lzRcHMcKTo,2020-08-31 15:28:26,Twitter Web App,7,26,covid; 
Our day in Brighton gave us a chance to reach voters at our Mill Pond event and see how the downtown is adjusting to the challenges of COVID-19. We started at the Brighton Farmers Market.

Finally to Studio Shop. Will runs a photo studio and Michigan-themed gift shop in downtown Williamston. COVID has hit his business hard but he's adding to the mural to the side of his shop for outdoor socially-distant portrait sessions.

Wearing a mask in public keeps our community safe— and is the least we can do to respect the work front-line health care workers are performing in battling COVID-19. And now you can show your support for our campaign with our official masks! https://t.co/5fHRaVm1Tm https://t.co/n4xNBroswb,2020-07-30 23:13:03,Twitter Web App,8,63,covid;

Wondering what it looks like to campaign during COVID? It looks like this!

People in my district are looking to see how all the elected leaders who represent them handle COVID-19 and will probably factor that into their decision when it comes to voting.

This week we held the first two training sessions for our dedicated volunteers on how to support 8th District residents amid the #COVID19 crisis.
