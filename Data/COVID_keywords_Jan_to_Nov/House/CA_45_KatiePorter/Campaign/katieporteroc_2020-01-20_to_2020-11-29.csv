New from me in @Jezebel: “The lesson from COVID-19 is not that moms aren’t doing enough to juggle. Instead it is that even during this national emergency moms are being asked to bear more than their share.”  Read more 👇👇 https://t.co/V3Ct1qDI34,2020-10-27 22:03:41,Twitter for iPhone,195,1229,covid; 
There’s been talk about meeting halfway in negotiations but there’s nothing to meet when the Senate hasn’t passed an alternative COVID relief bill and the President is busy tweeting temper tantrums.  Working families need help but the Senate and the President won’t do the work. https://t.co/9gOfvdnsoK,2020-10-15 00:49:01,Twitter for iPhone,1786,6215,covid; 
I’m wishing a happy birthday to our governor @GavinNewsom! He’s been a key partner as I fight in Washington to put California families first and I’m thankful for his leadership as our state navigates the COVID-19 pandemic and record-breaking wildfires. https://t.co/SxfFDPQ3cH,2020-10-11 00:28:14,Twitter for iPhone,464,5842,covid; 
The President’s flip flop on COVID relief shows that he’s more interested playing politics than helping people. But Orange County families regardless of party know that our state and local governments need federal support to pay our teachers and first responders. https://t.co/r0TIxB64km,2020-10-08 23:37:45,Twitter for iPhone,219,1375,covid; 
Coronavirus treatment and a potential vaccine should not be limited to the wealthy and the well-connected. This plan will save lives and protect Americans regardless of insurance status. https://t.co/KOO9qySATh,2020-10-06 20:08:35,Twitter Web App,362,2157,corona;

As COVID-19 cases increase we can't still be arguing about who foots the bill for testing. I secured a commitment from a top Trump official that they would make testing free. It's way past time to fulfill that promise. https://t.co/td4SKnvGbl,2020-07-07 18:01:08,Twitter Web App,269,1079,covid; 
I secured a commitment for free COVID-19 testing months ago. Then Congress passed additional legislation that would require this. Yet patients are still receiving bills.  I won't let this go: the Administration needs to keep its promise and implement the law more forcefully. https://t.co/MFaQUEXodA,2020-06-17 18:01:27,Twitter Web App,340,1501,covid; 
Simply put: the Trump Administration has dragged their feet on delivering relief to workers harmed by the coronavirus—and they're still prioritizing corporations over people. @ewarren and I are demanding they do better. https://t.co/xlKz0eYDjK,2020-06-16 20:52:44,Twitter Web App,1085,4310,corona; 
The FDA’s ban on gay and bisexual men donating blood is a discriminatory policy without scientific grounding. It could also undermine medical research as we race to find treatments for COVID-19. I’m pushing against this outdated policy.  https://t.co/2CHrVY83BA,2020-05-08 03:01:39,Twitter for iPhone,329,1773,covid;

I’ve never taken corporate PAC money and today I announced I’m taking it a step further by refusing donations from lobbyists.

Just before 1AM this morning I joined my House colleagues to pass the #FamiliesFirst Act which would deliver life-saving emergency resources for #COVID_19 to working Americans.
