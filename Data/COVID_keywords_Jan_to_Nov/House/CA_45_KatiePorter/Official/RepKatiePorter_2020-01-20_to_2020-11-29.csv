Irvine Company is offering a hardship exemption to residents who can’t pay rent because of #COVID_19.  This email was sent out after our office relayed concerns from UCI students and OC renters and we worked with IC to send clear communication that relief was available. ⬇️⬇️ https://t.co/VzrSjktfe9,2020-04-16 21:19:57,Twitter for iPhone,257,1180,covid;

Nobody chooses to get sick yet many Americans have to worry about long-term financial punishment due to unexpected medical costs. #COVID_19 brings into focus why this is wrong.

While I was sounding the alarm on #Covid_19 President Trump was encouraging companies to *increase* exports of medical supplies—as recently as the beginning of March.

Wellness Matrix Group told consumers their product was “FDA vetted and approved”—even  though the FDA hasn’t approved ANY at-home COVID test. @CongressmanRaja and I have launched an investigation but our work isn't done.

BTW one of the reasons the already-too-high number of families in medical debt will skyrocket is because this Administration has failed to make COVID-19 *treatment* free for Americans who need it. Of course the President continues to lie about this too. https://t.co/hZoNxtN94C,2020-04-02 16:18:22,Twitter for iPhone,459,1162,covid; 
My COVID-19 test came back negative which is a relief. I am still staying home because I have symptoms and need to recover; this means I will not be able to travel to Washington DC to vote.,2020-03-27 14:18:19,Twitter for iPhone,5459,86003,covid; 
Over the weekend I had a fever over 100.4 degrees. As instructed I continued to isolate in my bedroom and phoned my provider.

Paid leave will keep communities safe as people feeling unwell can stay home. I’ve written about why it’s important that any subsequent legislation to address #COVID_19 mandates comprehensive paid leave for Americans working for large employers.

As a single working mom I have to juggle—I couldn’t do it without a childcare provider.

I’m glad that party leadership is finally taking the idea of remote voting seriously after two Members tested positive for #Covid_19.

The #COVID_19 crisis highlights why we need comprehensive paid sick leave is. Nobody should go to work sick—putting other employees and the public at risk—because they won’t otherwise be able to put food on the table.

The Administration isn’t acting with the urgency this issue deserves.

I did the math: a full battery of coronavirus testing costs at minimum $1331.  I also did the legal research: the Administration has the authority to make testing free for every American TODAY.
