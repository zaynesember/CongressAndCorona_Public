In light of the public health crisis we face regarding the spread of COVID-19 and after careful consideration the Congressman’s election night event is being cancelled.  As always thank you for your support.  Be safe and take care of each other. https://t.co/aLRjOljat5,2020-03-16 20:12:07,Buffer,4,9,covid; 
Great seeing everyone at the fish fries in Lockport and at SS. Cyril &amp; Methodius Parish in Lemont. Don’t forget to wash your hands repeatedly to help prevent the spread of coronavirus and make sure you stay home if you’re sick. https://t.co/Z6XUMLDD0X,2020-03-14 18:55:00,Twitter for iPhone,4,18,corona;
