Inaction at local levels has handed death sentences to people who hadn’t even been convicted of a crime all because they couldn't afford bail.   Criminal justice reform is COVID relief.  It’s needed now. https://t.co/2lXMbkwC4K,2020-11-17 00:09:47,Twitter Web App,42,110,covid;

When I worked in a trauma center sometimes we’d have young patients.  The thing about young people is they have no choice but to rely on adults for advice and guidance.
