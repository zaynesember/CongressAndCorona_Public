The @USArmyReserve celebrates 112 years of service today. Right now nearly 3000 of their Soldiers are supporting the fight against #COVID19. Thank you to these heroes! https://t.co/IdCFMAEm4i,2020-04-23 14:29:37,Twitter for iPhone,7,8,covid; 
As Democrats and Speaker Pelosi try to capitalize on this crisis families are suffering. I am disappointed in Speaker Pelosi for blocking the third  coronavirus relief package. These resources are desperately needed particularly here in the 6th District. https://t.co/cpSWvHampQ,2020-03-23 02:36:57,Twitter for iPhone,23,28,corona;
