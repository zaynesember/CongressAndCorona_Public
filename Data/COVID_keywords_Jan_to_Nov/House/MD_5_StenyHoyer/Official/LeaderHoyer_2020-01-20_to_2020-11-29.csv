It was clear early on that a comprehensive testing plan would be necessary to control COVID-19 and save lives. This Administration has failed to deliver on such a plan. https://t.co/98Qv6qeEpz,2020-08-17 19:31:13,Twitter Web App,7,18,covid; 
The rise in coronavirus infections among children shows that they are not immune from this illness like Trump claimed. As the school year begins we must ensure we are taking all precautions to keep children families teachers and staff safe. https://t.co/XxBz3KswNF,2020-08-17 18:42:22,Twitter Web App,13,24,corona; 
Over 100000 Marylanders have now tested positive for the coronavirus. It is clear that this crisis is not going away anytime soon &amp; we must act to slow the spread. I urge the Senate to pass the #HeroesAct to ensure Maryland has the resources it needs to fight this virus.,2020-08-17 00:35:56,Twitter for iPhone,32,85,corona; 
The President's disregard for the number of lives lost from COVID-19 is alarming. It reflects his pattern of downplaying the severity of this pandemic &amp; his refusal to take responsibility. It didn’t have to be this way. Americans deserve better. https://t.co/WiANvi96xq,2020-08-11 19:08:53,Twitter Web App,9,22,covid; 
30 million Americans have lost expanded unemployment assistance since Senate Republicans hit pause on responding to the coronavirus pandemic. The American people are suffering. Republicans must come back to the negotiating table. https://t.co/D1d95u99r4,2020-08-10 17:07:45,Twitter Web App,11,26,corona; 
Our country has hit another horrific milestone in the coronavirus pandemic while President Trump’s executive actions do not address the crisis at hand.,2020-08-09 19:51:45,Twitter Web App,18,50,corona; 
I hope House Republicans will now join Democrats in using voting by proxy when necessary so that Congress can continue to do its work while preventing the spread of COVID-19 in our districts and on Capitol Hill.,2020-08-07 15:07:58,Twitter Web App,2,12,covid; 
Millions of families need this critical lifeline to make ends meet. House Dems passed the #HeroesAct to extend this assistance 12 weeks ago. As negotiations continue on the next coronavirus relief package Republicans must consider the urgent economic needs of American families.,2020-08-06 13:14:12,Twitter Web App,11,20,corona; 
The coronavirus pandemic has exacerbated the need for stable supportive housing for survivors of human trafficking. Today the MD Congressional Delegation announced critical funding to provide housing assistance so that survivors can live independently. https://t.co/JHbb01uxz6,2020-08-05 01:41:38,Twitter for iPhone,9,16,corona; 
After weeks of hitting “pause” on coronavirus relief the Senate GOP allowed critical assistance for Americans to expire. Here’s a look at what is happening in their states and the urgent need for additional assistance. https://t.co/EjiGOM36wp,2020-08-04 21:58:57,Twitter Web App,9,13,corona; 
As we continue to combat COVID-19 I’m pleased Prince George’s County firefighters will receive more than $600000 in funding to keep Marylanders safe. https://t.co/AyfPFAVULZ,2020-08-03 23:03:47,Twitter Web App,8,12,covid; 
I hope he will consider this suggestion which would go a long way toward eliminating barriers to the effective implementation of our COVID-19 relief programs and help modernize government systems more broadly.,2020-08-01 21:26:46,Twitter for iPhone,2,7,covid; 
11 weeks since the House passed the #HeroesAct Republicans continue to dissemble and delay in providing coronavirus relief. The House will not begin the August District Work Period until the Senate agrees to pass a COVID-19 bill that we can send to POTUS. https://t.co/qo4mMJjQiE,2020-07-31 22:30:09,Twitter Web App,15,19,covid; corona; 
America does not have dictators who unlawfully cancel elections. Trump has no power to cancel or delay the 2020 election which will happen Nov. 3. He is trying to distract from this morning’s dismal economic news and failure to address the COVID-19. https://t.co/BViCBhPO76,2020-07-30 22:37:13,Twitter Web App,27,59,covid; 
30 million are facing food insecurity and it's absurd that the Senate GOP's coronavirus bill does nothing to halt this worsening hardship for families. The nutrition assistance offered in the #HeroesAct would help. The Senate GOP must pass it now. https://t.co/H6uIuD0WNh,2020-07-30 21:32:07,Twitter Web App,18,23,corona; 
Several GOP Members have put staff at heightened risk of COVID-19 including Rep. Gohmert. I wrote to the Office of Employee Assistance to thank the office for its work &amp; ask whether there are sufficient resources to support staff &amp; meet the higher demand. https://t.co/nAwUb0UW67,2020-07-30 02:38:42,Twitter for iPhone,6,25,covid; 
Lastly I told press the Senate GOP’s coronavirus bill is irresponsible and says to Americans: you’re on your own. It is only a way of pretending to address this crisis. We need to reach agreement to provide relief to the American people now.,2020-07-29 17:21:10,Twitter for iPhone,8,36,corona; 
We must also ensure safe elections during this pandemic.  House Dems included funding for our elections in the #HeroesAct. I hope Republicans will work with us to provide this funding as we negotiate a coronavirus relief package.,2020-07-29 01:24:27,Twitter for iPhone,7,28,corona; 
The GOP coronavirus bill is a typical Republican response to the American people. It says: "you're on your own." It mirrors Trump's failure to respond to this crisis. It is insufficient. It will let down the American people. It will damage the economy. https://t.co/P6dSVkL9DS,2020-07-28 14:23:39,Twitter Media Studio,15,38,corona; 
Happy birthday to my friend @RepCharlieCrist from #FL13.

30 years after the ADA many people w/ disabilities live in segregated institutional settings which have been significantly impacted by COVID-19. We must commit to increasing home &amp; community-based services and supports so community living can be a reality for all. #ADA30,2020-07-24 16:18:52,Twitter Web App,8,18,covid; 
With the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases now at more than 4 million it is time for the President and Congressional Republicans to stop their infighting and work with Democrats to enact the next coronavirus relief bill. https://t.co/lOOrGmQOHo,2020-07-23 22:04:40,Twitter Web App,9,15,covid; corona; 
As the next coronavirus response bill is negotiated I joined @EleanorNorton @SenatorCarper @ChrisVanHollen to call for the equal treatment of DC residents.

Dems remain focused on making our economy work for every American. As we confront the challenges of COVID-19 we must continue to look for opportunities to strengthen manufacturing &amp; ensure the security of supply chains. I thank @repblumenauer for holding today's hearing.,2020-07-23 19:47:43,Twitter Web App,3,7,covid; 
Today’s hearing by @WaysMeansCmte Subcommittee on Trade is important to understanding not only the effects of COVID-19 on supply chains but also on the long-term challenges facing American manufacturing and economic growth. https://t.co/w6G96qmAG1 https://t.co/1Up7UBPjaQ,2020-07-23 19:47:42,Twitter Web App,5,15,covid; 
Medicaid has helped millions of Americans access affordable health coverage. It has been essential to our most vulnerable communities which have been hardest hit by COVID-19. As we work to defeat this crisis &amp; address long-standing health disparities we must #ProtectMedicaid.,2020-07-23 18:32:46,Twitter Web App,15,20,covid; 
Due to their own internal divisions Republicans still don’t have a coronavirus relief proposal. The House passed the #HeroesAct 2 months ago. Instead of acting Senator McConnell &amp; the Trump Administration waited. They chose to take a pause. Their inaction was intentional. (1/3) https://t.co/WEx8GKKWCT,2020-07-23 17:17:39,Twitter Web App,26,43,corona; 
#PaidSickLeave continues to be a priority for House Dems &amp; this crisis has made the need for it that much more apparent. We acted to provide paid sick leave for workers affected by the coronavirus but this report by @JECDems shows how more must be done. https://t.co/MxVW8YQorI,2020-07-22 20:02:48,Twitter Web App,5,12,corona; 
Coronavirus deaths rose by more than 1000 yesterday the biggest single-day increase since early June. This crisis isn't going away; it's getting worse. Republicans must work with Dems to provide Americans w/ the resources we included in the #HeroesAct. https://t.co/Ucd18zJhG7,2020-07-22 15:42:15,Twitter Web App,12,23,corona; 
Lastly I told press the GOP must work with us to pass additional coronavirus legislation soon. UI resources for state &amp; local governments to keep teachers and other workers on the payroll &amp; funding for testing tracing &amp; treatment are all essential to respond to this crisis.,2020-07-21 16:34:27,Twitter Web App,1,7,corona; 
As coronavirus deaths surpass 600000 it is deeply saddening that American lives account for nearly a quarter. Trump's failure to address this crisis has cost lives. It’s time for action to defeat this crisis. The Senate should pass the #HeroesAct. https://t.co/kVQJMbz4sw,2020-07-20 19:50:54,Twitter Web App,15,29,corona; 
The COVID-19 crisis is still with us. In fact it's gotten worse. In an interview with @Axios I reiterated what economists have told us: if you don't respond now it's going to cost us more in the long run. The Senate should take up the #HeroesAct now. https://t.co/bnGSRgHysG,2020-07-20 01:42:32,Twitter for iPhone,24,57,covid; 
The Administration should have never proposed this rule. Instead of attacking international students Trump needs to get to work to address the surge of coronavirus cases the shortage of protective equipment and delays in testing. https://t.co/sLap6bPs9O,2020-07-14 21:58:50,Twitter Web App,5,22,corona; 
COVID-19 has shone a bright light on long-standing health disparities in rural and underserved communities. Read this new report from @WaysMeansCmte on these inequities which must be addressed. https://t.co/OBUyD6mbJP,2020-07-14 17:46:40,Twitter Web App,7,9,covid; 
Trump has failed to focus on coronavirus testing from day one and delays in testing results will make it harder to get a handle on this crisis. The #HeroesAct includes resources to increase testing capacity. The Senate should take it up now.  https://t.co/rACNjyTfmJ,2020-07-13 19:30:03,Twitter Web App,10,17,corona;

COVID-19 is not “totally harmless” as Trump has claimed. For communities of color this pandemic has caused devastating loss. This crisis is not over yet.

Trump's claim that the increase in coronavirus cases is due to more testing is not true. He is misleading the public. In order to safely reopen we need to increase testing and tracing.

House Dems are pushing to extend the expansion of unemployment insurance benefits in the next coronavirus response legislation. The #CARESAct secured an additional $600/ week for those who have lost their jobs. Expanded unemployment benefits should continue during this time.,2020-04-30 19:12:18,Twitter Web App,4,11,corona;

I urge POTUS to make good on his promises to meet the critical need for #coronavirus testing. The bill that the House just passed would guarantee free testing.  But it is up to the Admin to ensure that testing availability is not a hindrance to our response.,2020-03-14 05:40:01,Twitter for iPhone,8,30,corona;

It is outrageous that those with COVID-19 symptoms are being denied testing across the country. This is inconsistent with POTUS's promise that “anybody” can get tested.
