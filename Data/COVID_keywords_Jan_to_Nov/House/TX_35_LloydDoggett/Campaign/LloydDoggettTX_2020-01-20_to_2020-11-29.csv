Unsatisfied with being a COVID superspreader Trump continues to superspread lies about the election he overwhelmingly lost. As more states certify Biden's win Trump's dangerous unfounded conspiracy theories become more certifiably nuts.,2020-11-24 23:01:08,Twitter for iPhone,3,4,covid; 
Among his many false claims Trump declares that "dead people" voted against him. Indeed due to Trump’s incompetence and lies many who voted for and against him are dead now from COVID.,2020-11-22 00:58:06,Twitter for iPhone,7,25,covid; 
Trump is as bad at counting ballots as he is at counting COVID infections and deaths of Americans lost to his incompetence and indifference. This tragic chart from @nytimes shows the only way he is really turning states red. https://t.co/Il1oB4gViz,2020-11-15 01:05:12,Twitter for iPhone,3,8,covid; 
That was a frantic long way to say Trump STILL doesn’t have any health plan. Like he admitted earlier right now he’s trying hard to strip care from millions + remove all protections for anyone with pre-existing conditions (that includes all COVID survivors). #Debates2020,2020-10-23 02:09:13,Twitter for iPhone,5,41,covid; 
Trump touts his quick recovery from COVID-19 relying upon medications not available to us following his denial delay and deception that has led to more than 223000 American deaths. #Debates2020,2020-10-23 01:21:21,Twitter for iPhone,6,18,covid; 
Trump keeps saying the coronavirus will “soon be gone.” If you vote Trump will soon be gone. #Debates2020,2020-10-23 01:09:20,Twitter for iPhone,21,130,corona;

Just like Trump Pence blames everyone but the administration for coronavirus.  Like Sen. @KamalaHarris says we must set the record straight.   The blame is on you Mr. Pence. #VPDebate,2020-10-08 01:55:21,Twitter for iPhone,20,91,corona; 
R-E-S-P-E-C-T!  Senator @KamalaHarris is right. You respect Americans when you tell them the truth not with delay denial and deception with coronavirus magical thinking. #VPDebate,2020-10-08 01:22:46,Twitter for iPhone,25,105,corona; 
No Mr. Pence. What universe do you live in? It’s not this America where over 210000 have lost their lives. Yet the President says “do not be afraid of COVID-19.” Preventive efforts were replaced with delay denial and deception. #VPDebate,2020-10-08 01:18:19,Twitter for iPhone,7,44,covid; 
Like Trump Pence cannot answer the question of why America is the worst country in the world for COVID deaths and infections. All he can provide is fawning over Trump. #VPDebate,2020-10-08 01:16:47,Twitter for iPhone,9,61,covid; 
Trump lied to the American people about COVID-19 and its deadliness. He didn't have a plan and over 200000 Americans paid so far with their lives and nearly 30 million are unemployed. Tonight I expect more shameless Trump deflection and denial. #Debates2020,2020-09-30 01:05:15,Twitter for iPhone,2,11,covid;

Trump cannot wish away the numbers - not for the approval ratings he craves and not for the coronavirus cases he would rather ignore. In November we must elect a President who will put the American public before his own ego. https://t.co/lsJ8RiZzWi,2020-07-13 19:24:35,Twitter Web App,2,3,corona;

The superspreader-in-chief is at it again. Perhaps Trump’s best friend isn’t Putin it’s #COVID19.
