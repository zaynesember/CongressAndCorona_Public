The San Antonio Metropolitan Health District has opened a COVID-19 hotline for residents to ask questions about the #coronavirus. The hotline is available in English and Spanish.

@AprilMolinaSA also featured @Public_Citizen's insight regarding this $700 million of taxpayer dollars invested into developing a publicly-funded #COVIDー19 vaccine/treatment.  #COVID #Covid_19 #CoronavirusOutbreak #CoronaVirusUpdate,2020-03-05 02:46:12,Twitter Web App,1,5,covid; corona; 
My goal is to ensure that once we get #coronavirus vaccine or treatment it's affordable for all Americans—the very people who already paid $700 million for its development. Shared with @News4SA that we're pressing Trump Admin so care and prevention will not be only for the few: https://t.co/aBddKTgzkM,2020-03-05 02:41:53,Twitter Media Studio,9,28,corona; 
Trump may respond to #coronavirus threat which he has continually downplayed with...  More tax breaks. The GOP cure-all.  Instead Trump should ensure public health agencies whose budgets he previously sought to cut are prepared. #CoronavirusOutbreak https://t.co/x1J9ohVNeq,2020-03-04 14:10:15,Twitter Web App,9,27,corona;

Joined well-coordinated San Antonio effort to address looming threat of #Covid_19 led by @Ron_Nirenberg &amp; Metro Health Director Dr. @DawnEmerickEdD.

We need leaders siding with patients. Not Big Pharma profiteers.  Taxpayers invested $700 mill in coronavirus vaccine research. But Trump's HHS Sec fmr price-gouging Eli Lilly CEO Alex Azar says Admin can't guarantee potential vaccine will be affordable. https://t.co/orcEzFBqH1,2020-03-03 17:35:35,Twitter Web App,14,18,corona; 
Discussed with @nytimes that Trump Commerce Dept is bafflingly encouraging export of critical medical supplies for #coronavirus even as Admin warns of shortages.  Instead of exports we need strong supports for our medical professionals keeping us safe. https://t.co/80WK2nb5aq https://t.co/Tu5tgFYwOJ,2020-03-02 22:50:01,Twitter Web App,7,19,corona;

We must ensure all Americans receive affordable #coronavirus treatment.  Financial barriers like the $4000 bill one family received will only deter those who may need treatment from fear they can’t afford it. #CoronaOutbreak https://t.co/dfnhKPKGas,2020-03-02 16:12:23,Twitter Web App,9,28,corona;

With 1st coronavirus death in America from unknown source we must calmly plan for every #coronavirus scenario.  Far better to be overprepared than to accept Trump misleadingly downplaying threat.,2020-03-01 16:34:40,Twitter for iPhone,4,28,corona;

Like his assignment of Kellyanne Conway to lead the opioid task force Trump views the #coronavirus threat as a political crisis first.  For him it’s about his political health not public health. https://t.co/26Kop0wpNX,2020-03-01 02:38:00,Twitter for iPhone,12,30,corona; 
Ensuring our veterans receive prompt access to quality care has long been one of my top priorities. Pleased this clinic will soon serve San Antonio veterans &amp; families.

This morning I sharply questioned President Trump’s Health and Human Services Secretary @SecAzar about the Administration’s mishandling of #coronavirus. Inept Administration response indifferent to the leading expert is endangering the lives of American families. https://t.co/YM0dm5igX7,2020-02-27 18:39:31,Twitter Media Studio,21,60,corona; 
He can never do that.  Now Congress must act promptly to overcome his indifference. #CoronavirusOutbreak,2020-02-27 16:27:32,Twitter for iPhone,0,5,corona; 
Wouldn’t it be better if he presented a plan concerning what is needed and what amount of money is necessary to fund what is essential to protect American families?  #COVID19 #CoronaVirusUpdates,2020-02-27 16:27:29,Twitter for iPhone,1,8,covid; corona; 
THREAD: While his new funding proposal has been criticized by even the GOP Senate Appropriations Chair as “lowballing” what is needed for #coronavirus Trump says he will take any amount of monies that Congress appropriates.  #COVID2019,2020-02-27 13:48:45,Twitter for iPhone,6,13,covid; corona; 
These professionals have told us it is not a question of if but when we have coronavirus spreading across communities as it has in other countries.  Better to follow scientists’ recommendations and move swiftly to invest in readiness and take every precaution.  #coronavirususa,2020-02-27 03:29:37,Twitter for iPhone,4,11,corona; 
Let’s hope that Trump’s claims are correct that coronavirus is little more than a bad flu season that will vanish soon.  But in case he is not smarter than the medical professionals it is better to be prepared. #CoronavirusOutbreak,2020-02-27 03:29:36,Twitter for iPhone,4,17,corona; 
At the very time Trump was holding his press conference telling us not to worry about coronavirus since he has all under control the first report appeared of apparent “community spread”—the very development medical professionals predicted. #coronavirusus https://t.co/l8bjBiS6PE,2020-02-27 02:27:11,Twitter for iPhone,10,23,corona; 
Unfortunately I have about as much confidence in Mike Pence leading us out of this crisis as Kellyanne Conway earned when she was tasked with leading us out of the opioid crisis.  #CoronavirusOutbreak #coronavirususa https://t.co/n24xELMA5y,2020-02-27 01:22:32,Twitter Web App,41,164,corona; 
Taxpayers have poured over $700 mill into research for a treatment or vaccine for coronavirus.  I’m leading a charge to ensure any resulting drugs can’t be rigged by Big Pharma and will instead be accessible available and affordable to all:  #COVIDー19 https://t.co/6lpe9rYIKE,2020-02-26 21:42:17,Twitter Web App,15,52,covid; corona; 
Trump’s Budget would cut CDC funding.  However the Democratic House will advance a robust funding package that mounts a serious response to this serious issue. #CoronavirusOutbreak  https://t.co/9Cm3RESr6X,2020-02-26 00:19:53,Twitter for iPhone,7,11,corona;
