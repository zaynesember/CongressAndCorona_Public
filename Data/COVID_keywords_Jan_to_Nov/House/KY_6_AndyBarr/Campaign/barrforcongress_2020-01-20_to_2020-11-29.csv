I signed a letter today with 126 other Members of Congress urging @SBAgov to investigate how Planned Parenthood received $80 million through the PPP.

Like many businesses Kentucky’s horse racing industry was forced to close because of COVID-19. They were unable to receive PPP loans to keep workers on their payrolls but I worked with the Trump administration to allow for these iconic businesses to be eligible for funding. https://t.co/i6mqiXFcaD,2020-05-09 00:24:01,Sprout Social,5,18,covid;

Joe Biden reportedly said he was excited about the opportunity for “institutional changes” because of the coronavirus.

President Trump was 100% right to call out WHO for their response to COVID-19. When the Chinese government started their coverup of the outbreak WHO cooperated.
