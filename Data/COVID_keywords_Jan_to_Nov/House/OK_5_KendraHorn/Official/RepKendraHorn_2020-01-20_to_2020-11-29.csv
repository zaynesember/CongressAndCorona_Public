Our public schools need resources to keep both our kids and teachers safe during the pandemic. Covid relief money should be used to ensure all children regardless of zip code receive a quality education not scholarships for expensive private schools. https://t.co/zxOXOaui9I,2020-08-06 18:42:54,Twitter for iPhone,91,351,covid;

Oklahoma has seen record high COVID-19 cases over the past week. It’s up to all of us to reverse this trend. Let’s do our part by wearing a mask washing our hands and maintaining distance to protect our friends and neighbors from COVID-19. #COVIDStopsWithMe https://t.co/LLlBCZH4bf,2020-07-29 18:02:01,Twitter for iPhone,23,91,covid;

Oklahomans deserve #LowerCostsForCare. Whether you have a pre-existing condition or you've lost employer sponsored insurance during COVID-19 everyone should have access to quality coverage. The Patient Protection &amp; Affordable Care Enhancement Act is must-pass legislation.,2020-06-29 21:58:09,Twitter for iPhone,12,66,covid; 
Striking down the ACA would eliminate health care access for 150000 Oklahomans. It would eliminate protections for pre-existing conditions and reinstate lifetime caps. We need increased access to care not the other way around especially during COVID-19. https://t.co/Fs4ZsZQHRx,2020-06-26 20:21:41,Twitter Web App,25,130,covid; 
Tens of thousands of Oklahomans who lost their jobs due to COVID-19 still haven't received unemployment assistance they're entitled to. They are hanging by a thread. We shouldn't be forcing people to wait in lines before sunrise. Let's work together to fix this @GovStitt. https://t.co/EGeECY2jRk,2020-06-25 20:55:41,Twitter Web App,70,395,covid;

This is not the time for partisan gamesmanship this is the time to find common ground and deliver help where it is needed most.
