As COVID hospitalizations hit record highs voters deserve to know where candidates stand on health care. Today I’m calling on @StephanieBice to release the details of her plan. Abolishing the ACA in the middle of a pandemic isn’t a plan – it’s a disaster. https://t.co/zCbW7LinrI,2020-10-26 16:57:54,Twitter Web App,26,151,covid; 
My bill provides educators an additional 25 percent hazard pay for the time they have to spend in person at schools during COVID-19.   Our educators truly are heroes and they deserve to be treated like it. I’ll always fight for our students teachers and schools.   #OK05Debate https://t.co/Oe02r0NXce,2020-10-20 22:15:58,Twitter Web App,8,43,covid; 
Congress provided funding in the CARES Act to supply our public schools with PPE virtual learning tools and school meals.

Abolishing the Affordable Care Act would leave hundreds of thousands of Oklahomans uninsured during a pandemic. Replacing their insurance with a savings account wouldn't come close to covering the cost of care especially if they got COVID. This isn't a plan - it's a disaster. https://t.co/KVvmbPV6dy,2020-10-18 20:00:00,Twitter Web App,91,227,covid; 
Today my opponent said we should abolish the ACA and replace health insurance with health savings accounts. That’s not a plan- that’s a disaster.  The average cost of a COVID hospital stay with no insurance is $73k. A health savings account won’t even come close to covering that https://t.co/abiOhr3wno,2020-10-13 22:23:37,Twitter Web App,333,790,covid; 
Like countless other Oklahoman small business owners Beth LaFave thought she would have to  close her doors when COVID-19 hit.

1 in 4 Americans have contemplated suicide since the start of COVID-19.
