Climate Change and COVID-19 are two of the biggest most urgent issues facing our nation currently.   We need a President who believes in science and will use it to lead our country moving forward. We need @JoeBiden.  #VoteForScience https://t.co/f6zifiTaUW,2020-09-15 20:36:57,Twitter Web App,3,15,covid; 
Trump covered up the danger of COVID-19  &amp; has done nothing in the *7 months* since to help Americans.  We need to vote like our lives depend on it this November - because they do.,2020-09-09 23:06:30,Twitter Web App,10,43,covid; 
Let's keep our successful COVID-19 response up and cases down 💪  Remember to wear your mask and social distance this long weekend😷   https://t.co/5jIJLh5GmO,2020-09-06 13:20:30,Twitter Web App,4,4,covid; social distance; 
The US currently has over 6 million COVID cases and yet Trump has no plan to contain the virus or take care of the American people and provide relief to families that are still struggling.   We need real leadership - now more than ever.  https://t.co/LcjaIF1vu9,2020-09-01 17:08:38,Twitter Web App,5,8,covid; 
Happy Independent Bookstore Day! I had the pleasure of visiting Narberth Bookshop last week and discussing challenges facing small businesses during COVID.

Too many lives have already been lost needlessly to the COVID-19 pandemic because of Trump's incompetence and mismanagement.   @JoeBiden will turn this health crisis around. He protects Americans &amp; brings his empathy for others to every aspect of his work.   #DemConvention,2020-08-21 03:01:16,Twitter Web App,10,24,covid; 
COVID-19 is disproportionately affecting Black communities - this is a result of decades of residential segregation inequity in healthcare &amp; environmental racism.  To fight the pandemic we need to ensure Black communities have equal access to testing &amp; healthcare.   #MaskUpPA https://t.co/qchSnW5K59,2020-08-18 16:02:03,Twitter Web App,2,8,covid; 
Trump has caused many needless deaths with his woeful mis-management of the COVID-19 pandemic.   We need a leader who believes in science. We need a leader who unites people and actually *leads* in a crisis. We need @JoeBiden  in the White House.   #BidenHarris2020 #DemConvention,2020-08-18 01:50:01,Twitter Web App,8,31,covid; 
I'm looking forward to returning to the House this week to pass much-needed funding for the USPS.
