SCOTUS just ended the #2020Census early.  @realDonaldTrump’s obsession with stopping the census will have lasting effects for years to come.   Countless communities will be denied the federal funds needed to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.  This will hurt a lot of people.,2020-10-13 22:37:14,Tweetbot for Mac,63,128,covid; 
I’m shocked the President would abandon the American people in this time of crisis by ending #COVID19 relief negotiations.  210000 are dead. Families are suffering. Millions are unemployed. Rent is due.   The President can end this suffering. Why wait? https://t.co/lEOKKjRZ8h,2020-10-06 22:20:11,Tweetbot for Mac,7,25,covid; 
I wish the President and First Lady a speedy and safe recovery.  This virus continues to be a threat we should all take seriously.  Remember to wear a mask wash your hands and continue practicing social distancing.  Together we can beat #COVID19.,2020-10-02 19:43:56,Tweetbot for Mac,2,10,covid; 
Working-class families in our community have been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic.  These families need help now. This legislation will help struggling families survive.

President Trump just confirmed what many of us have suspected all along. He is defunding the US Post Office to prevent Americans from voting by mail this November.

If you lost your job because of the coronavirus pandemic you know how critical the extra $600 in federal unemployment is for you and your family.   Unfortunately this vital safety net is about to end because of the Senate's inaction.,2020-07-21 17:46:38,Twitter Web App,3,8,corona;

Thank you Gov @GavinNewsom for stepping up for immigrants when others turn their backs.
