One of the scariest facts we’ve learned in @SelectGOP is that mammograms are down 87% due to COVID.   That is hundreds of thousands of lives at risk due to lost access to medical services which means the fight against breast cancer is as serious as ever.  https://t.co/vCD7ZHCg6w,2020-10-16 19:41:57,Twitter Web App,6,2,covid; 
What’s the difference in this version of House Democrats' COVID relief bill and the last partisan bill they floated? This one has $600 million less for law enforcement.   That’s not compromise that's defunding the police. https://t.co/tjFpjVr5hS,2020-09-30 19:14:28,Twitter Web App,4,7,covid; 
Great news for MO ag producers! @USDA is now providing additional direct assistance to farmers and ranchers whose operations have been affected by COVID-19.   For more information and how to apply please visit: https://t.co/wVLNdk199V,2020-09-22 16:55:47,Twitter Web App,0,1,covid;

I have been &amp; will continue to be a supporter of #USPS in Congress.   But Democrats are crying wolf over a manufactured crisis to distract from the fact that they refused to work with Republicans and @realDonaldTrump on further COVID-19 relief for America. https://t.co/zc3vn71QxO,2020-08-21 16:57:09,Twitter Web App,145,256,covid; 
I've become increasingly concerned about hospitals’ inflated COVID-19 fatality reporting during my time on @SelectGOP.   Now more than ever we need to be able to trust the numbers our medical officials are telling us.  https://t.co/stxhQErkrl,2020-08-07 15:17:03,Twitter Web App,8,13,covid;

I'm calling on @CDCgov &amp; @HHSGov to address COVID-19 death misreporting in hospitals.  The 20% additional reimbursement for COVID-related deaths may have created a perverse incentive to over-code COVID-19 deaths even if it wasn't the ultimate cause. https://t.co/mm8M4N2Hic,2020-08-05 18:46:46,Twitter Web App,216,411,covid; 
.@CDCgov Director and @HHSGov Assist. Secretary for Health have now both confirmed in @SelectGOP that hospitals in some states have been reporting unrelated fatalities as COVID-19 deaths to receive more funding.   This irresponsible and unethical practice cannot continue. https://t.co/zqzPxcFKH2,2020-08-04 18:30:17,Twitter Web App,13,11,covid; 
COVID-19 has created a real-life case study of CECL’s procyclicality &amp; has shown it wreaks havoc in a downturn.
