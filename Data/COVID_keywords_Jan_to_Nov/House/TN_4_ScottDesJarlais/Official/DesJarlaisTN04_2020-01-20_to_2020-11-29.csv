I'm sure WHO was very angry with China and wrote them a letter privately telling them how angry they were.  That'll show them...  #chinacoronavirus  https://t.co/JTEvtjKojd,2020-06-08 17:49:19,Twitter Web App,3,4,corona; 
China doubling down on its own failures with COVID 19 and thinks world distractions will allow it to be aggressive on Hong Kong and Taiwan.

When Donald Trump warned the country of coronavirus from China and declared the U.S. would work to defeat it — Nancy Pelosi tore up his speech. She was too busy with impeachment to help Donald Trump protect the country which he has worked hard to do despite these childish antics https://t.co/IBFAB8Nxdq,2020-04-01 18:56:32,Twitter for iPhone,5,13,corona;

The President has already shown remarkable foresight and energy in implementing an America First agenda that reduces our country’s dependence on unreliable China where the Communist Party created the conditions for coronavirus and concealed the extent. https://t.co/U8OdpJIoY7,2020-03-30 19:32:58,Twitter for iPhone,9,22,corona; 
The basic idea is for Tennesseans to continue “social distancing” to keep one another especially our most vulnerable citizens safe. Reducing groups will help to slow coronavirus and allow health care facilities to respond effectively.

We’re fixing outdated regulations that hampered widespread testing  and replenishing stockpiles. New testing methods and treatments are emerging almost daily.

The Liberal Media media is determined to prevent you from watching the President of the United States deliver updates about coronarvirus.

Here’s what’s really going on with the Resistance which hasn’t changed even when the rest of the country is pulling together. Impeaching the President when he’s dealing with coronavirus. Obstructing solutions in Congress. Attack ads on TV. Just give us a hand please. https://t.co/FY5VASP1LD,2020-03-29 17:13:04,Twitter for iPhone,3,10,corona; 
You’re better off watching the daily Coronavirus Task Force briefing than most mainstream media doing its best to inflame the public with faulty analysis.

All too common attitude on the Left and in liberal media — praising communist regime that spread coronavirus around the globe while attacking the President who warned of China impeaching him during initial response and spending big on negative TV ads rather than assisting.,2020-03-25 19:02:35,Twitter for iPhone,8,10,corona; 
At a time when we’re trying to get businesses and employees back up and running Nancy Pelosi thought now would be a great time to saddle them with MORE COSTS as part of the Green New Deal which the Resistance is trying to shove into emergency coronavirus relief.

White House Office of Science and Tech is organizing coronavirus “consortium” of public and private computing resources.

This is pretty low. After pursuing another failed impeachment — as the President was leading our national response to coronavirus — Democrats immediately began pouring money into negative attack ads.

It’s not just that CCP (Chinese Communist Party) hid coronavirus from world and did little to stop spread. Primary problem is CCP’s flouting of environmental and health standards in order to undercut competing economies that create conditions for succession of outbreaks.,2020-03-19 11:49:53,Twitter for iPhone,939,1043,corona; 
CCP hid virus from world allowed it to get out of hand and at the same time threatens to withhold medication to treat coronavirus. Ultimate result of this situation will be to move drug manufacturing out of China as we are doing with other industries for our own protection. https://t.co/q0eZ0MzKIG,2020-03-19 11:45:43,Twitter for iPhone,1279,1407,corona; 
This is some of the best evidence the Chinese government (CCP) lied about the extent of the coronavirus disease and delayed an effective response — and why Donald Trump restricted travel from China so early.

Donald Trump relaxed rules that had been hampering development and deployment of coronavirus testing allowing states and private  companies to take part.

Chances are you will not get coronavirus but if you do you’ll make a full recovery fairly quickly. That said you don’t want it and you don’t want to spread it. Be smart. Be calm also.

President Trump stopped flights from China and Iran very early. Slowness of some countries to act forced us to stop flights from Europe as well.
