This month is National Domestic Violence Awareness Month. Domestic violence is an issue that affects Americans of all backgrounds.   In times of high stress such as the COVID-19 crisis we have seen incidents of domestic violence and intimate partner violence increase. https://t.co/1G8kuUUBjf,2020-10-05 20:05:19,Twitter Web App,4,3,covid;

This week we joined 33 of my colleagues in a bipartisan letter urging Congress to not leave town until we have passed additional COVID relief.   The letter is another example of broad support for a common-sense approach to providing the American people with the aid they deserve. https://t.co/hlTFYEbKVx,2020-09-23 13:22:31,Twitter Web App,6,14,covid; 
We care about all the businesses and entrepreneurs who have been severely impacted by the COVID-19 crisis. Deploying this federal capital in #NY23 will ensure our local employers will be able to better weather this crisis and our economy will come back stronger than ever. https://t.co/jbaFMb7XSx,2020-09-09 18:26:01,Twitter Web App,1,3,covid; 
Thank you Univar staff for meeting with us recently to discuss the impact COVID-19 has had on manufacturing. We must continue to support more domestic manufacturers especially those who provide the country with critical chemicals medicines and other essential items. https://t.co/iqVMcnfT4e,2020-09-08 18:15:16,Twitter Web App,3,12,covid; 
Great to meet with staff at the Hornell Children’s Home today! We are fighting to support our #childcare providers as they tackle so many of the economic and health challenges COVID has created for working parents and their kids. https://t.co/lkBwgBnF7i,2020-08-31 17:07:29,Twitter Web App,4,9,covid;

As the dairy industry continues to fight through the economic impacts of COVID-19 it is only fair our dairy farmers have the opportunity to enjoy the full benefits of this landmark trade deal.🐄  More here: https://t.co/zSnbn63xRb,2020-08-13 21:33:43,Twitter Web App,2,6,covid; 
🚨 The deadline for Coronavirus Food Assistance Program applications has been extended to Sept. 11 2020.

We need to deliver direct aid to localities across the country that have been economically devasted by COVID.  There is bipartisan bicameral support for our #SMARTAct which would give communities the financial resources they need to continue providing essential services. https://t.co/unZJA4CF2M,2020-08-12 15:45:22,Twitter Web App,3,8,covid; 
COVID has demonstrated the dangers of our reliance on international supply chains and the importance of domestic manufacturing. Working together we can support innovation bring new econ opportunities to NY and restore the United States' place as a global manufacturing leader.,2020-08-11 16:18:47,Twitter Web App,0,2,covid;

Placing the blame squarely on the staff who care for our grandparents -- when the state knowingly created COVID hotspots by forcing homes to accept COVID-positive patients -- is a slap in the face to those who lost a loved one.,2020-07-06 18:46:58,Twitter Web App,26,46,covid; 
As @PolitiFact notes “the CDC warned nursing homes to keep COVID-19 out of their facilities and said nursing homes can admit coronavirus patients but only if they are able to properly care for them” (3/7). https://t.co/JM0TctliWt,2020-06-26 14:23:03,Twitter Web App,13,31,covid; corona; 
COVID isn’t going away any time soon. We're going to keep pushing for accountability and action until a comprehensive strategy is in place to protect our seniors from the impact of bad policies (3/3).,2020-06-26 00:51:13,Twitter Web App,3,19,covid; 
🚨 Three area hospitals on the front lines of the fight against COVID-19 will receive $20 million in critical federal aid.

Thank you Lori and Ian (owners of the great Billy Schu's Food Bar) for hosting us. We are committed to supporting our restaurants as they adapt to the challenges posed by COVID-19.

This is great news!   As co-chair of the @ProbSolveCaucus we’ve recently met with Regeneron and other industry leaders to discuss their innovative efforts to combat COVID-19 and policy solutions to strengthen our medical supply chains. https://t.co/EIK0Ay3Rpl,2020-06-11 19:45:41,Twitter Web App,5,4,covid; 
Great to visit with you all! We appreciate all the people who have kept our economy going during COVID.   We'll continue to do our part to ensure workers receive the financial support they deserve by advocating for our Rewarding American Workers Act &amp; other critical legislation. https://t.co/yTnzadRAiw,2020-06-02 22:11:41,Twitter Web App,3,6,covid; 
Great to see the IRS extend the “safe harbor” provision within key energy tax credits. As we noted earlier this month America's energy industry shouldn’t be put at a financial disadvantage because COVID’s destructive impact on supply chains has delayed projects.

Unbelievable.  The Governor lost control of the situation in March when he forced facilities to accept COVID-positive patients.   Instead of addressing the 5800+ deaths head-on he is now implying the state is incapable of putting policies in place to protect the elderly? https://t.co/rdjayRyco0,2020-05-27 21:03:19,Twitter Web App,1,2,covid; 
We have to clarify New York’s misleading rhetoric; the state was never required to force nursing homes to admit COVID-positive patients. Albany’s decision had disastrous consequences but no one is owning up to the mistakes.   We are pushing for answers. https://t.co/fzzKXNF8NU,2020-05-26 18:30:46,Twitter Web App,2,5,covid; 
Applications for the @USDA’s Coronavirus Food Assistance Program are now live!   The website below is filled with important information for our farmers regarding how to access this critical economic relief.  https://t.co/SmAItBjep1,2020-05-26 15:08:20,Twitter Web App,2,3,corona; 
The bill also includes a number of provisions and millions of dollars in federal grants for issues completely unrelated to COVID-19. How does that enhance our public health infrastructure or help get folks back to work safely? (3/4),2020-05-15 19:54:08,Twitter Web App,0,2,covid; 
🚨The CARES Act included a refundable tax credit for businesses that have been impacted by COVID-19 but able to keep employees on their payroll. The latest information and guidance on the rebate has been posted here:   https://t.co/IROTggBToF,2020-05-01 15:25:20,Twitter Web App,14,34,covid; 
Really @NYCMayor? Singling out an entire religious community like this in a time of crisis is unacceptable and shameful. Now more than ever we should be working together as a unit to beat COVID-19. https://t.co/VeothktVMY,2020-04-29 15:06:04,Twitter Web App,7,30,covid; 
My colleague Josh Gottheimer and I stand with state county and local governments during the Covid-19 outbreak. We cannot sit by and let our states go bankrupt. That is just wrong.   https://t.co/tx0EIhDtyh,2020-04-24 20:08:30,Twitter Web App,3,16,covid;

We care about keeping people safe and ensuring people have fair access to testing. This is why the Problem Solvers Caucus was proud to push Congress to pass a nonpartisan bipartisan $8.3 billion emergency funding bill to fight the coronavirus last week.

However if you are an older adult - or have serious chronic medical conditions like heart disease diabetes or lung disease - we would like to advise you to please stay home out of an abundance of caution with the outbreak of coronavirus threatening New York state.

Everyone should remain calm. The fundamentals of our economy are great. This is not the financial crisis. Congress  provided over $8 billion in funding so that the health professionals are better equipped to combat the #coronavirus just last week. (1/3),2020-03-12 16:08:00,Twitter Web App,5,9,corona;

Congress must rise above partisan politics and pass immediate emergency funding to fight the coronavirus. I was proud to send this message loud and clear after meeting with @Mike_Pence with my @ProbSolveCaucus colleagues. https://t.co/BGkLiIGABf,2020-03-03 19:13:00,Twitter Web App,3,5,corona;

Great piece as we think about preventing an outbreak of the coronavirus in the U.S.  "Americans naturally turn to the government when their health or physical security is at risk but a core U.S. strength is the breadth of its private medical resources." https://t.co/b4nvP8c5ro,2020-03-02 19:48:33,Twitter Web App,3,4,corona; 
Many House Democrats are pushing a drug pricing plan which would HALT innovation for new cures.   With a vaccine for Coronavirus desperately needed isn’t it foolish for those on the other side of the aisle to go down this path? https://t.co/aqu6fq4Wl2,2020-02-27 17:52:16,Twitter Media Studio,8,28,corona;
