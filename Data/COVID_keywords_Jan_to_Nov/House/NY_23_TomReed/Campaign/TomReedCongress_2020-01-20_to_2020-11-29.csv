Our Problem Solvers Caucus changed the national conversation on COVID-19 pandemic relief by putting forth a comprehensive bipartisan framework that brought both sides to the table. We can and must work together to solve the problems facing Americans.  https://t.co/epwlLlu4vO,2020-10-01 15:33:04,Twitter for iPhone,1,0,covid; 
Today I was proud to lead the Problem Solvers Caucus as we announced our COVID stimulus package. We are working to produce results for #NY23 and for the American people. We must end the dysfunction in Washington! https://t.co/B6zMUJYH8X,2020-09-16 02:33:18,Twitter Web App,2,5,covid; 
Securing funding for childcare providers is a priority of mine in the next COVID-19 relief package. This is a critical industry that provides tools for educational and social development of our nation’s children! https://t.co/P7UtkwJSIx,2020-07-23 13:28:32,Twitter for iPhone,2,0,covid; 
We stopped by Jones Memorial Hospital last week to thank the staff for their hard work and dedication on the front lines of the COVID-19 battle. We were able to secure $4.5 million through the Paycheck Protection Program for the hospital. https://t.co/VkmPMgx6i5,2020-07-06 14:21:57,Twitter Web App,3,1,covid; 
Here’s a solution on nursing home crisis- open designated facilities in our communities where Covid positive seniors are treated outside of hospitals and won’t infect other residents-once recovered seniors return home.  Wish it was done before- many  lives would’ve been saved!,2020-05-26 16:02:33,Twitter Web App,1,8,covid; 
Governor Cuomo and the State of New York have some explaining to do. Reports estimate New York sent more than 4300 COVID19-positive patients into homes and over 5800 residents died. We can't let this go away. New Yorkers deserve answers now. https://t.co/ic97kCmj6j,2020-05-26 15:12:42,Twitter for iPhone,2,5,covid; 
Unfortunately the HEROES Act proposed by Speaker Pelosi misses the mark. No committee work. No bi-partisan discussion. The result: a bill that's largely a partisan wish list and even includes things that are completely unrelated to COVID-19. Simply put we need to do better.,2020-05-15 18:10:12,Twitter for iPhone,2,2,covid; 
We must find a bipartisan plan to get our nation back on its feet. The Problem Solvers Caucus held our first virtual debate to show that although we are socially distant we can still make significant discourse on legislation happen. https://t.co/MTtN1Pj6r2,2020-05-14 13:22:04,Twitter for iPhone,2,0,socially distant; 
I visited Brooks Memorial Hospital to discuss a Paycheck Protection Program that would keep the staff employed and allow them to continue to help the people of our community. We must protect those who are on the front-lines during the COVID-19 crisis. https://t.co/HXqw0VfSFd,2020-05-11 21:03:21,Twitter for iPhone,2,1,covid; 
Happy #NationalNursesDay to all the selfless brave nurses working long hours on the front lines to combat COVID-19 care for our loved ones and so much more. #ThankYouNurses,2020-05-06 23:44:03,Twitter for iPhone,2,2,covid; 
Our farmers need help and I'm proud to announce the U.S. Department of Agriculture's creation of The Coronavirus Food Assistance Program a $19 billion program that will directly assist farmers during the COVID-19 pandemic. https://t.co/2LudadwVPW,2020-04-20 21:24:41,Twitter for iPhone,2,2,covid; corona;
