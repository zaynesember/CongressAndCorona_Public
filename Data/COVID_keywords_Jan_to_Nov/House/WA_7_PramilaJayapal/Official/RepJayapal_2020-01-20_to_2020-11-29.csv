This is a huge win for immigrants public health AND everyone!  After I pressed Ken Cuccinelli earlier this week the Trump Admin has confirmed that its “public charge” rule does NOT apply to #COVIDー19-related care.   We all deserve health care especially during this crisis. https://t.co/O5Y4fZsH7J,2020-03-14 01:45:59,Twitter for iPhone,301,1079,covid; 
Memo to Trump Administration: Testing &amp; treatment for COVID-19 must be free &amp; available for all Americans. Period.   Cc: @RepKatiePorter @RepPressley @RepUnderwood @Rosa_DeLauro @RepJoeKennedy https://t.co/bH5tyi9fiV,2020-03-13 19:51:41,Twitter Web App,157,524,covid; 
Workers in vital industries across Washington state are hurting because of #COVID19. Congress must ensure that we support working people and families who always pay the largest price during economic crises. https://t.co/gCFyLENpFi,2020-03-13 18:46:52,Twitter Web App,27,122,covid; 
We can’t fight a pandemic if the 70+ million uninsured or underinsured Americans can’t afford to access care.   Yesterday I joined @RepJoeKennedy to call on @VP &amp; @SecAzar to ensure the Administration covers ALL COVID-19 testing &amp; health care services costs for EVERYBODY. https://t.co/OzfTHw2fHz,2020-03-13 16:30:00,TweetDeck,149,523,covid;

We need even more aggressive steps from the Trump Administration to help working people and businesses who are being impacted by #COVID19—but I’m glad he has answered my call and those of #WA colleagues to extend the tax deadline for those affected. https://t.co/yj4BqEcTL3,2020-03-12 20:46:52,Twitter Web App,16,90,covid; 
#Coronavirus does not discriminate based on race gender or creed.   A rule that scares away some from seeking care is a public health risk for all of us.,2020-03-12 18:21:56,Twitter for iPhone,20,105,corona;

Trump’s “public charge” rule makes immigrants afraid of seeking medical care. It’s downright dangerous during a public emergency.   Cuccinelli committed to me @ an all-member briefing that he’d publicly &amp; explicitly clarify that the rule does not apply during #COVIDー19 outbreak. https://t.co/jNE2RHMIIT,2020-03-12 18:19:44,Twitter for iPhone,120,356,covid;

#Coronavirus impacts all of us. Stopping immigrants from seeing the doctor is harmful &amp; downright dangerous during a public health emergency.   Putting up barriers to care for some is a public health risk for all. The Trump Administration must immediately suspend its wealth test. https://t.co/chrLfxbotc,2020-03-11 21:27:16,Twitter Web App,78,253,corona; 
Have questions about today's announcements to prevent the spread of #coronavirus in #WA?  - Gatherings of 250+ in King County Snohomish &amp; Pierce counties are prohibited.  - Smaller non-essential events in King County are also prohibited.

It is critical that we work quickly to immediately mitigate the spread of #COVIDー19.   Science-based social distancing will help protect our families and communities.   Let’s continue to stick together and look out for one another—we will weather this together.,2020-03-11 18:16:59,Twitter Web App,21,78,covid; 
I applaud @GovInslee &amp; @kcexec for taking these science-based steps to help mitigate the spread of #coronavirus in Washington state especially in counties like King County that have been seriously affected.

Millions of kids rely on free or low-cost meals at public schools.   Proud to join @Ilhan to introduce the MEALS Act to ensure these kids still have access to food &amp; meals during any school closures due to #COVIDー19. It's our moral responsibility. https://t.co/uSQApaCiWl,2020-03-11 17:54:32,Twitter Web App,66,209,covid;

With the spread of #coronavirus it’s never been clearer: #paidsickdays should be available to all workers in every state. The ability to stay at home &amp; take care of your family to prevent the spread of disease should not be exclusive to the wealthy. #HFAnow #Covid19 @NPWF,2020-03-10 18:32:26,Twitter Web App,96,320,covid; corona; 
Our government needs to protect those who protect &amp; care for us &amp; our loved ones.   Domestic workers &amp; caregivers are on the frontlines of fighting against #coronavirus. We need to pass my Domestic Workers Bill of Rights to give these workers the protection they deserve. https://t.co/8LWrmXh4MR,2020-03-10 18:06:42,Twitter Web App,55,156,corona; 
Our constituents deserve better than this — @GOPLeader must apologize for his irresponsible &amp; hurtful language.  Coronavirus doesn’t discriminate based on race language party or creed. We’re all at risk.  Leaders must promote compassion &amp; community — not myths &amp; misinformation. https://t.co/Gb3otyXhEz,2020-03-10 16:53:55,Twitter for iPhone,48,300,corona; 
As they care for the sick our great frontline healthcare workers are most at risk of being infected by #coronavirus. Today I joined @EdLaborCmte colleagues to introduce legislation requiring @USDOL to issue emergency safety standards to make sure these workers are protected.,2020-03-10 14:45:48,Twitter Web App,40,178,corona;
