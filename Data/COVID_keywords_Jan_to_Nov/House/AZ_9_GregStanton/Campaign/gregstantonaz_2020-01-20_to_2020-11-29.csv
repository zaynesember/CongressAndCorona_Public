President Nez- I appreciate our close working relationship and look forward to supporting the Navajo Nation during the 117th Congress. Your strong leadership during this COVID crisis is a model for others to emulate. https://t.co/3NaRjl3crq,2020-11-04 20:59:29,Twitter for iPhone,5,65,covid; 
Tragically no Governor responded to the pandemic more poorly.  He shut down the economy but failed to prepare for a safe re-opening. COVID cases and deaths surged as a result. And he still blocked local officials from taking action until public pressure forced his hand. https://t.co/jmW6fhEjkg,2020-10-23 21:31:03,Twitter for iPhone,253,1270,covid; 
Please do not take medical advice from this man.   COVID kills. https://t.co/0lZ8X3fppj,2020-10-05 19:44:36,Twitter for iPhone,138,792,covid; 
Pastor Warren H. Stewart Sr. has faithfully led @FIBC1905 for more than 40 yrs and is one of the most important civil rights leaders in Arizona history. He and his wife Karen are now among the thousands of Arizonans fighting COVID. I’m praying for their swift and full recovery.,2020-08-10 15:54:18,Twitter Web App,20,98,covid; 
3727 new cases in the last 48 hours in @maricopacounty. A ratio of 53 NEW cases per county contact tracer every two days. The Board of Supervisors had months to prepare and blew it. This is scandalous.   Congress provided Maricopa County $400M to battle COVID. There’s no excuse. https://t.co/6IcrFS8Psq,2020-06-19 19:30:51,Twitter for iPhone,38,111,covid; 
This year @azgives created a Nonprofit Emergency Relief Fund to make it easy to help nonprofits losing critical funding due to coronavirus. All donations received into this fund will be distributed evenly among participating #AZGivesDay nonprofits. https://t.co/6QhLDbMD8V,2020-04-07 15:47:12,Twitter for iPhone,1,2,corona; 
Since 2013 thanks to our community's generosity @AZGives has raised $17 million for Arizona nonprofits. But this year many organizations are expecting to lose more than 25% yearly revenue due to COVID-19. These orgs provide critical services and account for 325000 AZ jobs.,2020-04-07 15:47:12,Twitter for iPhone,0,1,covid; 
Every year we honor the life of Cesar Chavez an seminal labor leader and civil rights activist.  The global coronavirus pandemic has put a spotlight on Cesar Chavez's lifelong message: Our nation is nothing without our workers.,2020-04-01 00:43:52,Twitter for iPhone,13,75,corona; 
Thank you @dougducey for getting this right.   It is time for @GeneralBrnovich to drop his lawsuit to deny more Arizonans health care.   Coronavirus will soon be a "pre-existing condition" for millions. Using our tax dollars to deny them health care is cruel and wrong. https://t.co/1qnhiEY5q0,2020-03-26 20:10:17,Twitter for iPhone,18,50,corona; 
Our @AZNationalGuard has specialized training in disaster management and logistics. They need to be called up into service now to fight #COVID19 and support our critical infrastructure workforce prepare logistics for drive through testing and other lifesaving tasks. https://t.co/qjaNtACQlH,2020-03-19 21:45:27,Twitter for iPhone,5,27,covid;
