It’s very suspect of the FDA to withhold authorization of plasma for COVID patients - a treatment used thousands of times every day for various conditions. This should be a decision between patient &amp; doctor. Does someone at the FDA have a political agenda? https://t.co/rhwE4xbzA3,2020-08-22 21:43:21,Twitter for iPhone,553,721,covid; 
Last night Twitter censored @realDonaldTrump for suggesting children are far less susceptible to COVID-19 than adults - a well-known fact - because it goes against the left-wing agenda to keep schools closed people out of work and destroy our economy to influence the election. https://t.co/jcju4j6bBb,2020-08-06 23:29:20,Twitter for iPhone,144,235,covid; 
A German study this month found children may actually slow the transmission of COVID-19. Out of more than 2000 blood samples - including 500 from teachers - only 12 had antibodies. Children may not act as “viral shedders” like adults to transmit the virus https://t.co/lIDKcMzy0r,2020-07-31 16:44:54,Twitter for iPhone,10,12,covid; 
Yale epidemiologist Dr. Harvey Risch: “When this inexpensive oral medication [hydroxychloroquine] is given very early in the course of illness before the virus has had time to multiply beyond control it has shown to be HIGHLY EFFECTIVE” against COVID-19. https://t.co/imjiGKvYNv,2020-07-30 18:56:25,Twitter for iPhone,12,33,covid; 
Warden Sandy McCain of Raymond Laborde Correctional Center in Avoyelles Parish died of complications due to COVID-19 after serving his community with distinction for 30 years.

Today I sent a letter to DOJ requesting that funds provided to Louisiana District Attorneys through the CARES Act be made available to cover operating losses due to COVID-19.

I’m at Monroe Airport preparing for our flyover of Monroe with the Aeroshell Aerobatic Team to thank first responders &amp; front line personnel helping us through the coronavirus outbreak and recent tornadoes.

Smitty's Supply Inc in Roseland is a great example of a 5th District company that switched gears to produce hand sanitizer to fight the COVID-19 outbreak.   https://t.co/M4l9SKFpRF,2020-04-10 15:09:48,Twitter for iPhone,17,71,covid; 
As I said when I first brought this to the public’s attention abortion clinics should have closed immediately to protect the public and save protective equipment for medical professionals treating COVID-19 patients. This is completely unacceptable. https://t.co/acDNVl9Eno,2020-04-09 20:57:33,Twitter for iPhone,2,15,covid; 
Louisianans are sacrificing their freedom &amp; economic well-being to stay home &amp; slow the spread of COVID-19 but abortion clinics in Shreveport &amp; Baton Rouge are conducting business as usual. This is a flagrant disregard for public health &amp; they should close immediately.,2020-04-03 12:07:54,Twitter for iPhone,12,56,covid; 
I’m thankful for @realDonaldTrump’s leadership during this national emergency. Many more people will be infected with COVID-19 before the situation improves but social distancing and good hygiene can slow the infection rate and keep our hospitals from being overwhelmed. https://t.co/Fe46R1iq4T,2020-04-01 19:26:53,Twitter for iPhone,53,237,covid;

Spoke to @Varneyco on @FoxBusiness this morning about the success we’ve seen treating COVID-19 patients with hydroxychloroquine as @realDonaldTrump has said.

As a physician who continues to see patients in a clinical setting &amp; through house calls I wholeheartedly agree with @realDonaldTrump’s initiative to use hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of coronavirus. The benefits - in lives saved - far outweigh the possible side effects.,2020-03-24 18:44:38,Twitter for iPhone,58,117,corona; 
Americans along the Gulf Coast and especially here in Louisiana depend on the oil and gas industry for their livelihood.
