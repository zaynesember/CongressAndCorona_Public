Do we see evidence of different long-term outcomes across the country based on alternative COVID-19 response efforts or just different timing with respect to waves of cases with no clear connection to a state’s efforts?,2020-11-16 17:56:36,Twitter for iPhone,58,731,covid; 
@AP4Liberty One issue is not a strong indicator of anything (*especially* when it’s COVID and you’re the governor of a sparsely populated state). I can find a few issues I agree on with almost anyone in politics.,2020-11-09 01:30:11,Twitter for iPhone,4,137,covid; 
After claiming he would wipe out the national debt in eight years he signed massive spending increases and created the highest ever federal debt—even before the coronavirus pandemic began.,2020-11-03 00:30:33,Twitter for iPhone,295,2841,corona; 
Governor Whitmer cannot legitimately invoke emergency powers on an ongoing basis when the legislature is available to address COVID-19.  It’s not an “emergency” under such circumstances. President Trump tried this nonsense with the wall and arms sales. The same principle applies.,2020-05-23 03:05:41,Twitter for iPhone,400,2627,covid; 
I voted no on last month’s $2+ trillion coronavirus bill. Among its many failures that bill denied assistance to millions of people. Today’s bill corrects an inequity by adding funds to PPP. But it doesn’t fix structural flaws that made the last bill so unfair and ineffective.,2020-04-23 20:20:05,Twitter for iPhone,349,2536,corona; 
As I said before and after I voted no on the last coronavirus bill it was never designed to work. The approach is inefficient and fundamentally flawed. The law disadvantages the smallest least resourced businesses. Even if they get a loan the PPP/UI interplay creates problems.,2020-04-20 15:15:37,Twitter for iPhone,540,3089,corona; 
Many of @GovWhitmer’s latest measures do little to combat COVID-19 but much to curb freedoms and escalate tensions. The governor should re-evaluate before she loses public support for more essential health and safety practices.  Thread: https://t.co/zgjJOoza4H,2020-04-13 20:58:27,Twitter for iPhone,141,640,covid; 
Many constituents are writing to me about how the latest coronavirus relief law is too complex and too slow to help them. These failures were predictable. The people need direct relief—fast. Get universal monthly cash payments to the people and get the bureaucracy out of the way.,2020-04-09 17:42:39,Twitter for iPhone,2189,11717,corona; 
The recent coronavirus law may help some Americans find temporary relief but it is too slow wholly insufficient and riddled with bad incentives and unintended consequences. The law will exacerbate and prolong a devastating economic decline that will harm millions of people.,2020-04-02 20:00:35,Twitter for iPhone,1146,5281,corona;

How we defeat COVID-19:  1. Social distancing. 2. Cash relief to Americans. 3. More tests and data. 4. More personal protective equipment. 5. Practical community-developed standards for businesses to operate. 6. Less red tape so more people can help and innovate. 7. Humility.,2020-03-20 23:45:46,Twitter for iPhone,4862,26170,covid; 
Social distancing remains the best thing we can do to defeat COVID-19. As government works to help Americans it must focus on fast simple direct relief. Complex interventions will be counterproductive. Our economy and health depend on individual knowledge and decision making.,2020-03-19 15:20:34,Twitter for iPhone,209,1224,covid; 
There’s lower demand for air travel because of COVID-19. Giving corporate welfare to a few big companies cannot revive demand. We should provide relief to all Americans during this pandemic. When the emergency ends demand will revive. When demand revives air travel will revive. https://t.co/lYJl7GfPm0,2020-03-17 01:35:26,Twitter for iPhone,4093,20245,covid; 
The best thing you can do during this period of uncertainty about COVID-19 regardless of your age or health is to engage in social distancing. Cancel public gatherings avoid close proximity to others and stay home as much as possible.,2020-03-12 04:40:07,Twitter for iPhone,2206,10330,covid; 
House leaders have told us they intend to hold a vote *today* on an $8 billion COVID-19 spending bill but they still have not made the text available for review. Members of Congress need to be given adequate opportunity to read and discuss legislation before we vote on it.,2020-03-04 18:05:55,Twitter for iPhone,766,5248,covid;
