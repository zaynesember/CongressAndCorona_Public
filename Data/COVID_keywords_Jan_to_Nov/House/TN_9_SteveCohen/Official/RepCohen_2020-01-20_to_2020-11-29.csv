During the terrible response to Katrina President Bush told the head of Fema “you’re doing a heckuva job Brownie“ @realDonaldTrump is 2020’s Bush dithering not using fed powers to save lives and no empathy.

The real message is #TrumpLiesAboutCoronavirus put us 2 months behind in our response &amp; our getting test kits and respirators.He will have been responsible for tens and tens of thousands of deaths.

Trump refuses to acknowledge his Administration’s missteps and falsely blames Obama for the shortage of #COVID_19 tests. He has failed to provide leadership during this national emergency.

The stable genius giving revisionist #CoronavirusPandemic report.Trump reading better11th grade level.Hasn’t directly placed blame on #Obama.

A #PayrollTax cut is NOT a good way to support working people. It won’t help hourly workers who are sent home without pay; benefits go to those least in need.

This is completely false. The #NoBanAct prohibits religious discrimination in immigration-related decisions and ends Trump’s bigoted #MuslimBan.

Proposing a stimulus plan that arbitrarily ends on #ElectionDay is transparently self-interested &amp; political. The response to the #coronavirus should be about providing economic relief to #SmallBusinesses &amp; working Americans not buoying the President’s reelection campaign. https://t.co/cwTHmGacfE,2020-03-10 20:47:45,Twitter Web App,45,109,corona;

Trump’s repeated attempts to downplay the danger of the #coronavirus is undermining the efforts of the #CDC and health professionals. He needs to stop contradicting #PublicHealth experts.

The CDC recommends washing your hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds to prevent the #coronavirus from spreading. #COVID19 If soap and water isn’t available use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.

Mike Pence is not a #PublicHealth expert. As Governor his policies led to the worst #HIV outbreak in Indiana history.

Trump left critical positions in charge of managing pandemics vacant proposed cuts to the #CDC reduced efforts to combat infectious diseases &amp; weakened our ability to respond to the #coronavirus.
