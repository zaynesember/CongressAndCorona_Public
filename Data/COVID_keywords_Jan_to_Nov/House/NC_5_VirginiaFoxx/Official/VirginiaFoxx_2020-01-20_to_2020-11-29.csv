Impeachment. A misguided Coronavirus Committee. Now the 25th Amendment.   Democrats apparently have the time to come up with baseless pursuits that are devoid of logic.  But they don’t have time to work with Republicans to protect the American people.  No surprise at all...,2020-10-09 14:26:53,Twitter for iPhone,59,94,corona; 
Democrats claim they’re fighting for American families and small businesses but what did they just do?  They BLOCKED a coronavirus relief bill that would help the very same people they claim to fight for.  They only care about posturing. What an absolute disgrace.,2020-09-10 18:12:03,Twitter for iPhone,672,1253,corona; 
At such a pivotal moment for our country it’s imperative that we identify areas where we can cut bureaucratic red tape that hampers recovery from COVID-19.  Read my joint statement with @RepJamesComer ⬇️  https://t.co/q6FrHjDJeo,2020-08-05 14:59:10,Twitter for iPhone,12,30,covid;

Speaker Pelosi’s ‘bipartisanship be damned’ approach is outright dangerous. Partisan theatrics will not protect our country from COVID-19.   👇 My statement on H.R. 6800 👇  https://t.co/56WoXgUvVN,2020-05-15 22:35:28,Twitter for iPhone,15,17,covid;

Businesses in North Carolina's 5th District are doing their part to defeat COVID-19.

Not surprising that POLITICO skews the narrative and equates COVID-19 deaths to the 2020 election. The media’s name shame and defame campaign against @realDonaldTrump is repulsive. This is a new low. https://t.co/T3LkoAnK3R,2020-04-23 20:35:42,Twitter for iPhone,18,51,covid; 
Will the creation of a select committee on COVID-19 really ensure effective oversight or is it another ‘Tremendous Opportunity to Restructure Things to Fit Our Vision’ like Whip Clyburn openly admitted? Here’s a hint: It’s the latter. https://t.co/13CwjjXujc,2020-04-23 02:25:47,Twitter for iPhone,166,660,covid; 
Another step in the fight against COVID-19. Thank you @LabCorp for spearheading the production of this crucial diagnostic test that will help protect and inform the American people! https://t.co/2NIqt2l622,2020-04-21 16:22:10,Twitter Web App,1,2,covid; 
These numbers come from the same officials that have relentlessly churned out misinformation to downplay COVID-19. Sadly this is just another example of the media buying into their narrative.
