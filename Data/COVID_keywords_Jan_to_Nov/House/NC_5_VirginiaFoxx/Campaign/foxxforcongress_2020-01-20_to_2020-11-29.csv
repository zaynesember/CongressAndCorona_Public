I hope you will join me in prayer tomorrow during the National Day of Prayer. Let's especially lift up those who are suffering from COVID-19 and those who are heroically serving on the front lines of the battle against this pandemic. #NationalDayOfPrayer https://t.co/f87Yt57NIS,2020-05-06 17:50:57,Twitter Web App,1,1,covid; 
How are you creating social distance today to help slow the spread of coronavirus?    It's important for everyone to do our small part by limiting our non-essential travel and personal contacts right now.  I hope you'll stay safe and be smart today.  #TogetherApart  #NCBoots,2020-03-19 20:41:32,Twitter Web App,2,4,corona; social distance;
