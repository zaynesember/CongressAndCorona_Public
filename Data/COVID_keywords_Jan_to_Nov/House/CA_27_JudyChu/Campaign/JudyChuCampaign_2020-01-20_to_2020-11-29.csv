In the 12 hours after President Trump announced he tested positive for COVID-19 a surge of anti-Asian sentiment and conspiracy theories proliferated on Twitter.  Here is my interview on KCRW about what can be done. https://t.co/UCXedZ6Jcy,10/10/2020 21:52,Twitter Web App,0,3,covid; 
AAPIs have been hit hard by the #COVID19 pandemic. Meanwhile Donald Trump continues to spew racist anti-Asian hate calling the coronavirus the 'China Virus'. I want a POTUS who cares about our communities. I'm with @JoeBiden #StandTogether #AAPIsforBiden https://t.co/sv9HilnX17,10/9/2020 23:34,Twitter Web App,0,3,covid; corona; china virus; 
.@JoeBiden showed tonight that he is the only candidate that cares about all of us especially the families of the 170000 that have lost their lives due to this country's failed response to COVID-19.  We can be united toward a better America and Joe will lead the way. #DNC,8/21/2020 4:06,Twitter for iPhone,1,2,covid; 
I fell in love with @DrBiden tonight perhaps because like me she was a dedicated community college teacher. But mainly she was the glue that helped the Bidens heal after incredible personal loss.  America needs her empathy &amp; strength after losing 170k lives to COVID19 #DNC2020,8/19/2020 4:28,Twitter for iPhone,4,9,covid; 
Our nurses deserve the resources they need to care for us and keep themselves safe during #COVID19. That’s why I stand with the nurses of @SEIU121RN as they strike for a safer work environment. #SupportHealthcareHeroes  https://t.co/hHdoAVM8ru,6/26/2020 12:24,Twitter for iPhone,0,3,covid; 
We know that people of color are dying at higher rates from #COVID19. But with this joke of a report the Trump administration is either not willing or not capable of giving us the tools we need to support those that are hurting the most. https://t.co/BGrMVJsMYH,5/28/2020 22:51,Twitter Web App,1,3,covid; 
Trump failed to act in time and now nearly 100000 people are dead from #COVID19. But instead of taking responsibility he's doing what he always does: stoking xenophobia. @JoeBiden &amp; @TammyforIL are right. His words cause real harm and he doesn't care.   https://t.co/MQuhWPZcYf,5/27/2020 16:53,Twitter Web App,1,3,covid; 
Immigrant workers are disproportionately on the front lines but they've been left out of #COVID19 relief. I'm grateful to @APIAVote @votolatino &amp; @MAFpajarito for launching https://t.co/FKSBtg3Ktx - with a $1M investment from @EastWestBank - to get immigrant families help now.,5/12/2020 14:55,Twitter Web App,2,4,covid;
