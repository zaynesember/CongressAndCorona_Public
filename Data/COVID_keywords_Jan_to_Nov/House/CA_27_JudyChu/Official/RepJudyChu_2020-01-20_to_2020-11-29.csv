There is no healthy economy without healthy people. We need more testing and contact tracing or else people who go back to work will be at risk of catching or spreading coronavirus again.,2020-04-28 19:25:47,TweetDeck,14,74,corona; 
We don't have a border with China. Also the fact that you can't distinguish between China &amp; Chinese AMERICANS puts Asian American lives at risk. @SpeakerPelosi stood with the #AAPI community as you were stoking xenophobia and downplaying the threat from coronavirus entirely. https://t.co/Q0OHATUsP8,2020-04-16 19:44:15,TweetDeck,92,228,corona; 
When coronavirus hit people blamed Asian Americans. Chinese restaurants were the first to close. Physical and verbal assaults were rising. @SpeakerPelosi did the right thing and stood up to discourage xenophobia. The President would do well to follow her example not mock it. https://t.co/3qvNbXkndp,2020-04-16 13:48:50,TweetDeck,24,66,corona; 
The US helped create the WHO to keep people healthy especially during a global pandemic like this. Many countries depend on the WHO right now to fight coronavirus. But now more people will needlessly die because Donald Trump needs somebody to blame for his own delayed actions. https://t.co/6RGG7HLXeV,2020-04-15 13:59:20,TweetDeck,20,42,corona; 
"I don't take responsibility at all." - Donald Trump   "The governors are supposed to be doing it." - Donald Trump   The conflict and confusion are because of the President trying to protect his own image from accountability instead of protecting the people from coronavirus. https://t.co/WABdTgPvvQ,2020-04-13 15:34:03,TweetDeck,32,79,corona; 
Listening to experts works. Social distancing staying home &amp; protecting ourselves can slow the spread of coronavirus. That's why it's essential you wear a mask if you go out. And you don't need a professional one. You can make a CDC approved one at home: https://t.co/GVPHecyt1Q,2020-04-13 15:14:16,TweetDeck,15,25,corona;

Nursing home workers are on the front lines against coronavirus everyday. And since the virus makes visits impossible we count on them to care for our loved ones more than ever.

Small businesses hire 2 out of every 3 new employees. And immigrants are more likely to start a small business.   That's why we're fighting to ensure more money goes to small businesses and minority business owners in our next coronavirus recovery bill.,2020-04-08 16:34:07,TweetDeck,5,30,corona; 
To survive this crisis we need to 1) contain the coronavirus and 2) make sure all workers get support they deserve. For this to work we can't discriminate against immigrants. My bill HR 6437 will ensure access to healthcare w/out punishment &amp; food/cash benefits to all taxpayers,2020-04-06 18:32:33,TweetDeck,27,88,corona; 
Treating coronavirus can cost from $30000-$75000 w/out insurance. So far 13k Californians have gotten sick w/ peak still weeks away. Not having insurance is not an option. That's why in addition to covering #COVID19 costs we must protect ACA from GOP attacks #protectourcare,2020-04-06 16:54:46,TweetDeck,21,62,covid; corona; 
The coronavirus doesn't discriminate and neither should Congress. The $2 trillion recovery bill we passed is meant to help the whole country get through this. That doesn't work if we exclude whole communities. We must include immigrants in the recovery https://t.co/HnKsXb659m,2020-04-03 23:25:49,TweetDeck,11,41,corona; 
You can't go to school a restaurant or church because of coronavirus social distancing but gun stores are still open. Even during a pandemic Donald Trump will find a way to value profits for the gun industry over people's lives. https://t.co/49V4ZwXezB,2020-04-01 18:02:47,TweetDeck,24,39,corona;

REMINDER: USCIS announced that immigrants who get medical attention for COVID19 symptoms (cough aches fever) will NOT be penalized under the Public Charge rule. This is important.

This is right across from my office. Racism and xenophobia of this kind have absolutely no place in my district or our country. It’s exactly why I have demanded that our elected officials act responsibly and immediately stop calling COVID-19  the “Chinese” or “Wuhan” Coronavirus. https://t.co/y7LJU1XzKS,2020-03-14 18:55:49,Twitter for iPhone,87,236,covid; corona; 
Keeping everyone safe from #coronavirus is a team effort and I’m proud to be doing my part by voting for the bill today that will let workers stay home without losing their paycheck or their job which can mean missing meals or rent payments.

A virus's name should be descriptive &amp; helpful to epidemiologists and the public. That includes symptoms or cause. It does not include region or nationality.

The House right now is debating my #NOBANAct to repeal President Trump's cruel #MuslimBans. But true to form Republicans are being dishonest about it.

*Everything you need to know* like this: "Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of people a place or a nation.

Racist and wrong. Your own medical experts in your own government say that a wall would not stop #covid-19. They also say that calling it the "china virus" as below puts people in danger.

Either Rep. Scalise has not read my bill or he has and is being dishonest to you about it. Repealing the Muslim Bans would in no way impact our #Covid-19 response. My bill just requires that any bans be based on evidence (an actual pandemic) not prejudice ("ban all Muslims"). https://t.co/sQCFWgkH5l,2020-03-10 17:10:29,TweetDeck,55,110,covid; 
Clearly Pompeo is ignoring his own colleague @SecAzar who told me last week that "ethnicity is not what causes the novel coronavirus." So no calling it the "Wuhan virus" is not an accurate description of anything other than a desire to spread racism &amp; fear. https://t.co/wsDD5BHxWN,2020-03-06 15:39:05,TweetDeck,17,35,corona; wuhan virus;

Health experts: If you're sick go see a doctor.  Trump Admin: If you're an immigrant who goes to the doctor you may be punished.  These two ideas are not compatible.

Being Chinese- or Asian-American does not make you more likely to carry the #coronavirus. Recent and prolonged travel to impacted areas does. The risk of spread in our community is low - and prejudice does not help. https://t.co/63NYyI6DWO,2020-02-14 19:47:14,TweetDeck,13,31,corona;
