If you want to know why COVID relief is tied up in Congress one key reason is that Republicans are demanding legal immunity for corporations so they can expose their workers to COVID without repercussions.

@mcuban I don’t say this to point fingers but if we only say “shame on both” &amp; don’t actually drill down to see *what* is holding things up then it’s just performance  Right now GOP is demanding a full liability waiver for corps so they can expose workers to COVID w/o repercussion,2020-11-24 19:40:44,Twitter for iPhone,272,3294,covid;

On the election end @repblumenauer &amp; @RepDonBeyer are pressing state governments to come up with plans for election continuity to account for coronavirus.  (In 2018 58% (!) of poll workers were over 60. We have to protect them too.)  https://t.co/8F2wzSRc38 https://t.co/PVQlrWzttj,2020-03-13 18:57:00,Twitter for iPhone,323,2678,corona;

First up: as many of you saw yesterday Katie Porter did a masterful job in Oversight to get the (hesitant) CDC to commit to FREE testing on Coronavirus ⬇️ https://t.co/4iuv9T3wcZ,2020-03-13 17:40:17,Twitter for iPhone,1000,10258,corona; 
There is a lot going wrong with the admin’s current response but I also want to make to highlight some of the progress my House colleagues &amp; I are making on Coronavirus response despite challenges.

I’ve been discussing policy responses for Coronavirus but there is plenty we can also do to care for each other NYC!  - Check on your neighbors (can be through the door) - Offer to run errands for the elderly - Tip (a lot) extra if you can - Donate to food pantriessheltersetc,2020-03-13 15:28:57,Twitter for iPhone,4520,29311,corona; 
We need to dramatically expand #COVIDー19 testing and *processing* capacity.  It’s imperative to our public health that everyone who needs a test can get it easily and for free as quickly as possible - no matter whether you’re a sports star or a single parent. https://t.co/CbEibvr8r9,2020-03-13 01:13:40,Twitter for iPhone,6846,37362,covid; 
Hey all wanted to drop a📝 for accountability.  I usually don’t go on FOX on principle but misinformation about coronavirus has made me concerned about risk.  As a result I decided to go on @BretBaier to discuss coronavirus response + make the case for paid leave Medicaid etc,2020-03-12 22:44:34,Twitter for iPhone,5361,69335,corona;

It’s great to see Republicans understand this crisis &amp; advocate for socialized medicine.  No one should be charged for getting tested for Coronavirus &amp; no one should be charged for getting treated.  This applies to pandemics and it should apply to any condition or care you need. https://t.co/bpwvIj5sL0,2020-03-03 20:17:48,Twitter for iPhone,5958,33735,corona; 
Mike Pence literally does not believe in science.  It is utterly irresponsible to put him in charge of US coronavirus response as the world sits on the cusp of a pandemic.  This decision could cost people their lives. Pence’s past decisions already have. https://t.co/NhMPOusOWm,2020-02-27 01:27:09,Twitter for iPhone,35902,173447,corona;
