Let me get this straight:  Huge potentially life-saving news for Americans is announced—COVID vaccine is 90% effective in trials.  And the Left reacts by saying it's "bad news" because it happened while Trump is in office?  Unbelievable.  They're beyond parody at this point. https://t.co/xkt1F3xM1O,2020-11-09 16:56:41,Twitter Media Studio,1510,3561,covid; 
🚨 The Justice Department sent letters to New York and New Jersey demanding their nursing home COVID data.  Thousands of seniors were killed by their policies—but Governors Cuomo and Murphy still refuse to give Congress the information requested.  Time for answers.,2020-10-29 00:27:45,Twitter for iPhone,1160,2612,covid; 
🚨🚨 Today Chuck Schumer and Senate Dems once again BLOCKED a clean COVID relief bill.  Don't let them blame @realDonaldTrump. Don't let them blame Mitch McConnell.  Every time Republicans try to deliver aid to Americans Dems block it to play politics.  RT so everyone knows!,2020-10-21 19:45:51,Twitter for iPhone,15643,17913,covid; 
🚨 Add Cuomo to the list of anti-vaxxer Dems.  He's now telling Americans to be skeptical of a CDC/FDA approved COVID vaccine.  This from the same man who broke federal guidelines and issued a nursing home order that killed thousands of seniors.  Maybe he should sit this one out. https://t.co/7P3NFRxyIr,2020-10-19 21:33:05,Twitter Media Studio,828,1650,covid; 
What Pelosi should be focused on: A COVID relief deal.  What Pelosi is actually focused on: 25th Amendment fantasies.  Some things never change. Dems will always put their political agenda above the needs of workers and families.  RT if you’re sick of it! https://t.co/PWDiNZUwAG,2020-10-09 16:07:43,Twitter Media Studio,1299,1885,covid;

Some things never change.  Pelosi's "new" COVID bill isn't new.

Americans are fed up. https://t.co/UVQw5M5OOj,2020-09-30 22:15:57,Twitter Media Studio,1976,3077,covid;

Priorities are telling.  This Dem Majority has held ZERO hearings on China's COVID lies.  What have they wasted time on instead? - USPS hoax - Hearings with liberal celebrities - Voting schemes - Partisan games—that hurt workers &amp; families—to push their far-left political agenda https://t.co/RZ5GDmKe3e,2020-09-23 15:33:36,Twitter Media Studio,507,996,covid; 
China: - Unleashed Coronavirus on the world - Lied to cover it up - Hoarded PPE for leverage - Tried to hack our vaccine - Corrupted the World Health Organization  Yet Dems block action to hold them accountable.

Don't let Dems and their partners in the media spin this differently:  America is on the doorstep of a safe effective vaccine for COVID-19 because of @realDonaldTrump's leadership and Republican congressional action to increase federal funding to fight viruses and find cures. https://t.co/a1Rf5cIIKC,2020-09-15 18:53:49,Twitter Media Studio,382,926,covid; 
CUOMO EXPOSED:  – Despite objections from nursing homes he ordered them to admit COVID positive seniors  – He used shady math to cover up the deaths  – Nursing homes that refused the order kept quiet out of fear saying “I know how vindictive [Cuomo] is.” https://t.co/BtiuJnjggY,2020-09-12 17:24:08,Twitter for iPhone,4522,6150,covid; 
🚨 HUGE → @TheJusticeDept is demanding data from Cuomo and the other Democrat governors who forced COVID patients into nursing homes.  Investigations into their deadly orders could be coming under the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act.  They won't get away with this.,2020-08-26 19:41:13,Twitter for iPhone,8555,19512,covid; 
Instead of holding Gov. Cuomo and Gov. Whitmer accountable for their deadly orders to force COVID patients into nursing homes Democrats gave them a primetime speaking spot on the first night of their convention.  Unbelievable.,2020-08-18 01:34:37,Twitter for iPhone,5826,10636,covid; 
He knows he violated protocols by forcing COVID patients into nursing homes.  He knows that killed thousands of seniors.

Families who lost parents and grandparents in New York nursing homes after Cuomo violated federal health protocols and forced COVID patients into them are outraged.

Cuomo wants to cover up his nursing home tragedy. This victim's daughter called him out:  "Failure to obtain actual numbers of COVID cases &amp; instead labeling death certificates as natural causes is unacceptable."  Her mom was cremated without being tested. https://t.co/g5MYHM9dHp,2020-08-05 19:56:37,Twitter for iPhone,744,1280,covid;

Here’s what Dems won’t tell you:  There’s $500+ BILLION in unspent funds from past Coronavirus bills that can be used flexibly—including to help states.  Congress shouldn’t pile more debt on future generations to bail out mismanaged blue states that were failing before COVID. https://t.co/t1281DolOY,2020-08-03 22:34:57,Twitter Media Studio,469,869,covid; corona; 
Dems' demands: - Mail-in/No-ID voting - Stimulus checks to illegal immigrants - Green New Deal provisions - Tax breaks for blue state millionaires - $ for sanctuary cities - $ for pot industry  What a joke.

First Whitmer ordered COVID patients into nursing homes—killing thousands of seniors.  Then she tried to cover it up.  Now she vetoed a bill directing COVID patients away from nursing homes.

The liberal media won't tell you this.  Yesterday Dr. Fauci told Congress: - Trump's leadership has saved lives. - He agrees with Trump's decisions. - Trump is working with America's smartest doctors and experts to combat COVID-19.

45 governors followed federal protocols to avoid COVID in nursing homes.  5 Democrat governors didn't.  10000+ seniors died.  Today Admiral Giroir again said it's dangerous to send COVID patients to nursing homes.

- China lied to the world about Coronavirus - China corrupted the World Health Organization - China hoarded PPE for leverage - China is trying to hack our vaccine research  Yet Democrats still refuse to take action to hold them accountable.

🚨 Dems are using the Coronavirus Committee to play politics &amp; attack @realDonaldTrump.

Coronavirus Committee Democrats' hearings/briefings so far:  9 to harass @realDonaldTrump.  0 to investigate the thousands of nursing home deaths caused by the NY NJ MI &amp; PA governors' orders.  Their priorities are telling. Dems only care about one thing: politics.,2020-07-30 18:01:59,Twitter for iPhone,1132,2247,corona; 
Forcing COVID patients into nursing homes &amp; killing 6000+ seniors is bad enough.  What's even worse: Covering it up.  Cuomo STILL refuses to release which facilities were impacted by his deadly order.  Enough dodging. Victims' families deserve the truth. https://t.co/HxZb8qjvJP,2020-07-21 13:33:51,Twitter Web App,1823,3164,covid; 
Today House Dems held another sham hearing on Coronavirus.  Yet they STILL refuse to investigate the thousands of nursing home deaths caused by the NY NJ MI &amp; PA governors' orders.  Why?

🚨 BREAKING 🚨 Dems blocked Republicans from calling a witness at today's Coronavirus Committee hearing—a complete violation of their own rules.  Some things never change in Pelosi's House.

Joe Biden can't even get out of his basement. What makes anyone think he can get our economy back on track after Coronavirus?

Cuomo may not take protecting seniors in nursing homes from COVID-19 seriously—but @realDonaldTrump’s administration does.

Disgusting to watch Cuomo laughing on late night TV &amp; bragging about his COVID response when he has the highest death toll in the nation—including 6000+ seniors killed by his nursing home policies.

What a joke. Cuomo will say anything to try to pin his own COVID scandal on @realDonaldTrump.  Let’s review what happened on Cuomo’s watch: – 6000+ nursing home deaths – 500% more nursing home deaths per capita than Florida – 50%+ New York COVID deaths a result of local failures https://t.co/h7R5rfVsMY,2020-07-13 21:16:33,Twitter for iPhone,3101,5088,covid; 
Disgusting. Cuomo’s latest “report” is just another attempt to cover up the deadly outcome of his own decision to force COVID-19 patients into nursing homes.  This from the same man who is still trying to blame the workers who cared for these seniors.  He has no shame. https://t.co/je5qEJki6H,2020-07-06 19:24:22,Twitter for iPhone,413,906,covid; 
China lied. People died.  Now we have more proof the WHO lied too.  They claimed China reported Coronavirus to them—but just admitted that NEVER happened.

Another example of Pelosi putting politics over people:  Yesterday she passed a bill that will make it HARDER to develop a COVID-19 cure.  All to push more socialist wish list programs.

The guidelines were clear: You don't force COVID-19 positive patients into nursing homes.  But that's exactly what Governor Cuomo did.
