Quick update: I have received my results from the PCR test confirming that I am positive for COVID-19.  I will continue to self-isolate through the duration and serve the people of West Michigan. Thank you to the medical professionals who deal with these cases on a daily basis.,2020-10-15 13:50:53,Twitter for iPhone,27,123,covid; 
Earlier today I was expected to appear with the Vice President. While taking part in offsite testing protocols I took a rapid test that came back positive for COVID-19. I am awaiting the results of a PCR test and I am self isolating until I have confirmed results.,2020-10-14 17:31:30,Twitter for iPhone,390,823,covid;

Yesterday I signed the discharge petition to require Speaker Pelosi to vote on extending the Paycheck Protect Program for #WestMichigan. Congress has already allocated this funding to help small businesses in our community impacted by the coronavirus. This should be unanimous. https://t.co/WW04n7IXXQ,2020-09-30 13:57:00,Twitter Web App,15,59,corona; 
Covid-19 doesn’t recognize political parties and neither does our delegation when it comes to saving lives. I am proud to join my Michigan colleagues and wear a face shield made in #WestMichigan by Primera Plastics. https://t.co/2BBL7lyHkm,2020-07-22 22:33:50,Twitter for iPhone,9,56,covid;

This is an interesting chart on many fronts. Despite the COVID cases in NY look where they are on overall unemployment. As for Michigan I believe this shows how important it is to open those parts of our economy that can be done safely as soon as possible! #worksafe https://t.co/oUKvA5k6kW,2020-04-24 14:00:41,Twitter for iPhone,5,18,covid;

With the #HEROESAct Congress can show meaningful support for those saving lives on the front lines of the Coronavirus outbreak. Thank you to the incredible medical professionals and first responders answering the call here in #WestMichigan and in communities across the nation! https://t.co/HOi8W1Ka6v,2020-04-16 02:43:25,Twitter for iPhone,9,25,corona;

Let's show our support for the life-saving efforts of our first responders &amp; medical professionals serving on the front lines against the coronavirus by passing the #HEROESAct! Read my op-ed on this important bipartisan legislation in the @dcexaminer! https://t.co/nzyXQo6Bax,2020-04-13 15:47:30,Twitter Web App,21,44,corona; 
The #HEROESAct is designed to support our first responders and medical professionals battling the coronavirus. As Congress continues to evaluate a phase 4 relief package I am working to build bipartisan support for this important measure.

Big News! Later today I will be introducing the #HEROESAct to support first responders and medical professionals. This legislation will provide a federal income tax holiday for those serving on the front lines against the #coronavirus https://t.co/8dNQBQpdSf,2020-04-03 11:36:13,Twitter for iPhone,23,67,corona; 
Incredible! It’s great to see #WestMichigan manufacturers play a leading role in producing PPE equipment to help keep people safe as they treat and combat #COVID19! Thank you @JRAutomation! #AllInThisTogether https://t.co/66HPCTkGUy,2020-03-31 22:38:42,Twitter for iPhone,9,24,covid; 
Glad to see the Senate pass the Phase lll of our #COVID19 response albeit three days after it could and should have passed. Now on to the House. While I expect an overwhelming vote I don’t believe “Unanimous Consent” is the right way to pass a $2TRILLION spending bill!,2020-03-26 03:51:35,Twitter for iPhone,5,21,covid; 
We are all in this together. The goal of this conversation is to help provide tools for #WestMichigan job creators during the current challenges created by #COVID19. The call is getting underway at 1:30 #SmallBiz https://t.co/W7Oe12g67h,2020-03-24 17:23:18,Twitter for iPhone,3,9,covid; 
This is EXACTLY what I was talking about in an earlier tweet... stop playing games with non-COVID issues and get to the job at hand. Our Money Market accounts 401k’s and pensions can’t wait for this Dem “wish list”! https://t.co/bsn16z47i8,2020-03-23 16:32:40,Twitter for iPhone,15,13,covid; 
This is why the Senate needs to pass a COVID19 response not a Christmas tree bill with everyone’s pet projects ASAP! Keeping people on a payroll is far less expensive than putting people on unemployment and then trying to get them back into the workforce. Support small biz! https://t.co/e2K9ehqJhU,2020-03-23 14:36:31,Twitter for iPhone,22,57,covid;

Just wrapped up a meeting with  @briancalley to discuss the impact of #COVID19 on Michigan #SmallBiz and potential legislative action at the federal level.

As Chinese officials continue to promote conspiracy theories regarding #COVID19 it is utterly ridiculous for China to try and draw parity on this issue. It is crystal clear what the communist regime is doing.  (3/3),2020-03-17 17:56:46,Twitter Web App,13,31,covid; 
Very positive news out of @realDonaldTrump’s address this afternoon detailing how testing capacity will significantly increase.

Tonight it was announced that there are multiple confirmed cases of #COVID19 in #WestMichigan. I am closely monitoring the situation and in contact with local health officials. Please remember to use commonsense measures like washing your hands to protect you &amp; your family. https://t.co/lyHgilDvMG,2020-03-13 01:44:59,Twitter for iPhone,23,34,covid;
