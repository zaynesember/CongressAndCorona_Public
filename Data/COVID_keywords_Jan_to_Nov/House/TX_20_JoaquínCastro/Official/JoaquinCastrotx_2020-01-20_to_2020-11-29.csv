This action is not only an attempt to divert attention away from Trump’s failure to stop the spread of the coronavirus and save lives but an authoritarian-like move to take advantage of a crisis and advance his anti-immigrant agenda.

Millions of taxpaying hardworking families often with American citizen children are not receiving stimulus checks because 1 member of their family is an immigrant.
