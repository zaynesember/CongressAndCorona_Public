A single $1200 stimulus check was a good start but #WorkingFamilies need more to survive #COVID19.  We shouldn’t be debating a 2nd check.

Since the beginning of this crisis I’ve been vocal about the need to collect specific #COVID19 demographic data.  As the #LGBTQ community is at greater risk and often has less access to care I joined my colleagues to ask @SecAzar to collect this data and protect all Americans. https://t.co/mSfmceTbDt,2020-05-21 21:58:55,Twitter for iPhone,5,16,covid;

Clearly @realDonaldTrump’s focus continues to be on #VoterSuppression  and his own electability NOT the #COVID19 crisis those impacted by it or our efforts to address the economic fallout.  With such an absence of leadership in the Oval Office this shouldn’t surprise anyone. https://t.co/lcxPXpK12b,2020-05-20 21:17:21,Twitter for iPhone,3,8,covid; 
Our local community health centers are vital in helping #CA34 stay healthy &amp; safe through quality accessible care for all.

The #AAPI community helps make #CA34 one of the most unique &amp; culturally diverse districts in the US.   In the face of #COVID19 bullying &amp; hate against them has tragically been on the rise.

Another petulant tirade against a doctor trying to do his job.  Nothing new. We see this nonsense every time a public servant speaks up.  But with #COVID19 threatening us all @realDonaldTrump should focus more on his @WhiteHouse’s failure to contain the virus &amp; less on his ego. https://t.co/BwY6zhKBsm,2020-05-14 17:18:18,Twitter for iPhone,5,12,covid;

The #CARESAct &amp; the newly introduced #HeroesAct means more direct cash payments &amp; #RentRelief will find its way into #WorkingFamilies’ pockets.

Financially surviving #COVID19 demands #RentReliefNow for #WorkingFamilies.  With this in mind @HouseDemocrats included $100B in rent assistance in the #HeroesAct that will:   🔸Help households immediately  🔸Prioritize low-income families   🔸Use CURRENT income for eligibility https://t.co/V7PPfgdQYf,2020-05-13 00:13:25,Twitter for iPhone,7,15,covid;

Again @realDonaldTrump’s ire toward the media took over as he abruptly ended his @WhiteHouse #Coronavirus Task Force briefing after forbidding @CNN’s @kaitlancollins from asking her question.

Aides tried to get @realDonaldTrump to refer to this #PublicHealth threat by its name: #coronavirus. His @HHSGov Secretary agrees. Dr Anthony Fauci also agrees but Trump just can’t help himself.  #API communities are facing a racist backlash.

At @WhiteHouse’s #coronavirus briefing @PeterAlexander asked @realDonaldTrump about his message to those scared of what’s to come.  Rather than a sensible answer to a sensible question Trump lashed out &amp; threw a fit.  Very disappointing.

Words matter.  How we characterize this crisis matters.  And our immigrant communities — who have experienced racist backlashes in the wake of the #COVID19 pandemic — matter.
