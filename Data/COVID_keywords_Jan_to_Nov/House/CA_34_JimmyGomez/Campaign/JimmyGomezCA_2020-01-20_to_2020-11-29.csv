That’s why I have stood up to Trump to protect immigrants &amp; Dreamers.

That’s correct. “Too little support” doesn’t get people the help they need and will only lead to more economic pain in the short and long run.  That’s why Democrats are fighting for a robust COVID19 relief bill of at least $2T - money for health care testing &amp; unemployment. https://t.co/Z5eMxlQz8S,2020-10-06 19:15:28,Twitter for iPhone,2,5,covid; 
The way Trump is acting during this #debate is exactly why the country has lost 200k people to COVID19 millions are struggling to make ends meet and the mega rich keep getting richer during this pandemic. #2020PresidentialDebate,2020-09-30 01:44:36,Twitter for iPhone,2,15,covid; 
Trump knew how “deadly” the virus was back in February. It’s on TAPE!  Yet Trump lied about the seriousness of the COVID19 virus.   And 190k people lost their lives and even more are seriously ill because of that lie.  Shameful.  https://t.co/EQNnL9rBtE,2020-09-09 23:26:09,Twitter for iPhone,3,6,covid;
