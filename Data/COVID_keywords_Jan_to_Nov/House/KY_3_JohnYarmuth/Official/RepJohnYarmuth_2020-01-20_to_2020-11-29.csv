Mitch McConnell is blocking COVID relief for Kentucky families because he wants complete legal immunity for every business — even if that company is so reckless that its managers allegedly bet on how many workers get COVID each day. https://t.co/nQkIBgOjKi,2020-11-20 00:50:12,Twitter for iPhone,68,189,covid; 
There are so many things I’m looking forward to in a Biden-Harris Administration — a real national strategy on COVID reuniting children at the border returning to the Paris Climate Accords real values and character in the White House and so much more.  How about you?,2020-11-07 22:09:12,Twitter for iPhone,43,633,covid; 
Enough with this bogus claim you idiot. The cause of death is what actually caused your death. If you had COVID and walked outside and got hit by a bus the cause of death wouldn’t be the virus it would be the bus. Stop shamelessly attacking our doctors nurses and hospitals. https://t.co/YeRvQRkbQh,2020-10-26 19:54:37,Twitter Media Studio,80,400,covid; 
The WH has given up on controlling COVID as we experience the largest loss of American life since WWII — more than 4000 people a week.   75 years ago they died to save the world from Nazis.   Today we’re dying because Donald Trump and his Republican enablers just don’t care. https://t.co/P2qAMPWEmH,2020-10-26 17:49:24,Twitter for iPhone,50,109,covid; 
Enjoyed today's roundtable with Hispanic and Latinx leaders in Louisville. Discussed COVID relief worker protections and the need for ACTION on immigration. GOP inaction has stalled much but Democrats must also do more. We as a nation have failed our immigrant population. https://t.co/MisADNSkKa,2020-10-14 19:30:39,TweetDeck,6,30,covid; 
Just participated in a Virtual Town Hall with @kynonprofits. These orgs have stepped up during COVID to care for our communities—now they need their elected officials to do the same. @POTUS and @senatemajldr need to stop the games and support the House-passed relief package ASAP.,2020-10-08 16:17:08,Twitter for iPhone,18,75,covid; 
President Trump did not create or invent the coronavirus. But his reckless actions—and the even more dangerous inactions of his Admin.—make him directly responsible to the families of the more than 190000 Americans who have been taken from us including nearly 1000 Kentuckians.,2020-09-09 19:45:38,Twitter for iPhone,7,68,corona;

It’s bad enough the @SenateGOP is acting like the #COVID crisis is behind us. But to do this while 1 in 10 American households don’t have enough food in a given week is abhorrent. Americans are going hungry &amp; Republicans’ don’t care. https://t.co/C3uMhDwaEE,2020-09-03 17:16:20,TweetDeck,17,69,covid; 
Morning video calls with Jewish Federation of Louisville @BrewersAssoc @KYGBrewers &amp; more. Glad many of my constituents can bridge COVID digital divide but Fed gov't must do more.

We shouldn’t forget just as Breonna Taylor’s death is not just Louisville’s problem George Floyd’s death is not just MN’s problem. They and all other manifestations of racism are as poisonous as COVID-19.,2020-05-29 13:35:09,Twitter for iPhone,68,273,covid;

Just voted in favor of next phase of #COVID19 relief for hospitals small biz &amp; increased testing. State and Local relief MUST be next.

Sure Mitch between impeachment &amp; the subsequent trips to Mar-a-Lago campaign rallies—saying coronavirus is a "hoax" "like the flu" "one day like a miracle it will disappear" &amp; accusing hospitals of stealing masks &amp; respirators—how can anyone find time to save American lives? https://t.co/0OYdhhKUhz,2020-04-01 00:16:31,Twitter for iPhone,149,404,corona;
