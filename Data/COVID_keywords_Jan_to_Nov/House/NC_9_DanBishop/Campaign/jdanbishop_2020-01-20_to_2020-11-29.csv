Are media even curious why the new “record” COVID hospitalizations in Mecklenburg (182) are so far off the projected peaks for mid-May and mid-June of 4750 3000 and 1506. Do they remember or care that hospitals sought $70 million in federal dollars to build surge beds? #ncpol https://t.co/z843EBdWAL,2020-07-07 23:14:11,Twitter for iPhone,18,33,covid; 
Mecklenburg COVID-19 hospitalizations on 6/24 — 134.  Remember that county hospitals and government issued these projections of PEAK (not cumulative) COVID-19 hospitalizations:  3/23 — 4750 by mid-May 4/5 — 3000 by mid-May 4/10 — 1517 by mid-May 4/14 — 1506 by mid-June  1100% off https://t.co/jsqgl7q3TJ,2020-06-27 15:06:31,Twitter for iPhone,46,104,covid; 
.@realDonaldTrump I am heartsick for Charlotte as we pay the price for @RoyCooperNC’s incompetence.  Some governors managed tough COVID outbreaks to success.

Trend is consistent with @IHME_UW model but orders of magnitude higher in total.  @IHME_UW now projects -- statewide -- peak COVID beds of only 713.

Friday eve (4/10) @AtriumHealth sent me limited data on modeling after 3 weeks requesting. Told me I couldn't share as was "EMBARGOED" even tho is a public record.

On Mar 23 @AtriumHealth gave @MeckCounty this model with 30% distancing.  It predicted almost 1000 COVID hospitalizations in #CLT (not cases) by now on the way to a peak just under 5000.
