Today @AppropsDems are marking up our FY21 Defense bill which provides $33.3B for Defense Health Programs including for #COVID19 response &amp; $8.5 million to implement the Women Peace and Security Act to promote women’s participation in peace &amp; security efforts worldwide. https://t.co/HP5IZfHgI1,2020-07-14 15:41:51,Twitter Web App,4,4,covid; 
His attacks on the #ACA come even as millions more Americans are losing their coverage during the #COVID19 pandemic due to enormous job losses.   He’s putting the health of millions of Americans–especially women–at stake.   https://t.co/WKoHzegK4m,2020-07-14 15:25:20,Twitter Web App,1,2,covid; 
Insurance companies used to engage in gender discrimination regularly: charging women more for the same coverage as men &amp; not covering things like pregnancy.   The #ACA changed that–but @RealDonaldTrump wants to repeal it in the middle of #COVID19.  https://t.co/Pr7jIBw0HD,2020-07-14 15:25:19,Twitter Web App,9,4,covid; 
Importantly this bill also directly addresses the devastating impacts of the #COVID19 pandemic on our communities with more money for public health seniors and state unemployment systems. #ForThePeople,2020-07-13 21:40:54,Twitter Web App,1,5,covid;

Instead of focusing on how to stop the rapid spread of #COVID19 in FL &amp; fixing our still broken unemployment system the Governor is following Trump’s lead and distancing himself from the reality of this crisis. https://t.co/sb7oBtkPYq,2020-07-09 20:56:16,Twitter Web App,3,11,covid; 
We can't allow millions of Americans impacted by #COVID19 to lose their federal unemployment benefits at the end of this month.

The decision to leave the @WHO in the middle of the #COVID19 pandemic which has already cost over 130000 Americans their lives is a dangerous one.   @realDonaldTrump you can't pass the buck on this.

While the House is taking action to address the #Coronavirus the White House was trying to add restrictions to abortion access into legislation to tackle this pandemic.   This attack on #ReproductiveFreedom is fully unacceptable ESPECIALLY given how urgent this situation is.,2020-03-13 20:21:26,Twitter Web App,21,53,corona;

Like I said during the @AppropsDems Hearing with @CDCDirector: calling #COVID19 the "Chinese Coronavirus" isn't just wrong it’s inappropriate.   Republicans parroting this rhetoric should be ashamed of themselves.   https://t.co/elIspeEc2b,2020-03-11 20:30:08,TweetDeck,4,7,covid; corona;

Another piece of disinformation @CDCDirector dispelled today: There is no truth to calling #COVID19 the “Chinese Coronavirus.”  It’s a harmful inappropriate and xenophobic way to refer to a disease that has impacted millions around the world. https://t.co/XSScc7NWRv,2020-03-10 18:11:27,Twitter Web App,2,3,covid; corona; 
What @realDonaldTrump has said about #coronavirus:   It’s a hoax. It’s like the flu. You can still go to work. You can still shake hands.  Was he telling the truth according to @CDCDirector?  Nope.  We need @POTUS to get his facts straight &amp; take #COVID19 seriously. https://t.co/uwQrSFm7Xg,2020-03-10 18:10:05,Twitter Media Studio,5,12,covid; corona;

Like many Americans I have questions about what the #Coronavirus means for my community.

.@CDCGov recommends staying home from work if you are sick.   But many American workers lack #PaidSickLeave &amp; can't afford to take time off work—which could make the spread of #COVID19 worse.
