Folks shouldn't have to choose btwn staying home or working when they're sick - especially during a public health crisis. We need to pass @rosadelauro’s Healthy Families Act - if we’re going to contain COVID-19 we need to get serious about paid sick leave. https://t.co/26QNHWYxsi,2020-03-10 00:49:26,Twitter Web App,41,215,covid; 
Returned to HV this weekend to brief our community on the House’s $8.3B COVID-19 package &amp; what it means for NY’s emergency response.  Congress is providing $950M to help state &amp; local health agencies contain the virus &amp; keep folks safe.  This is a step in the right direction. https://t.co/q5fPiWYdJx,2020-03-09 20:55:42,Twitter for iPhone,12,97,covid; 
LOCAL UPDATE COVID-19: Made key inroads at my round table with Hudson Valley health care specialists &amp; leaders yesterday. A bipartisan multi-level governance response is the only way forward when it comes to keeping folks in the Hudson Valley safe. We're in this together. https://t.co/8PHe2iZKPz,2020-03-07 14:07:45,Twitter Web App,26,172,covid; 
The president has failed to take this seriously.  This shouldn't be about politics.  It’s about having an effective bipartisan rapid response based on science that is going to save lives. #COVID19 https://t.co/DBcT7VqrZB,2020-03-06 17:45:00,Twitter Media Studio,52,238,covid; 
This is @realDonaldTrump’s Hurricane Katrina. He’s been shown to be clueless and ineffective on (1) testing kits (2) timeline to vaccine (3) protocols and (4) mortality rate. Worst of all he’s in denial and that can = disaster. #coronavirus,2020-03-06 14:32:34,Twitter for iPhone,555,2631,corona; 
.@HouseDemocrats’ $8.3 billion emergency response package delivers the resources we need for a government-wide response to coronavirus. It is a fundamental step forward in our fight to contain this public health emergency &amp; protect the American public. #COVID19 https://t.co/zUWWly9FYP,2020-03-05 19:47:06,Twitter Web App,25,72,covid; corona;

The Trump Administration’s request for emergency coronavirus funding is woefully insufficient.  @HouseDemocrats will move swiftly to enact a strong strategic funding package that fully addresses the scale and seriousness of the coronavirus epidemic.,2020-03-02 23:07:01,Twitter Web App,66,399,corona;

For 2 yrs Trump has left positions in charge of handling pandemics @WHNSC &amp; @TheJusticeDept vacant.  His FY21 budget slashes @CDCgov funding.  And his coronavirus response is wholly inadequate.  Congress must act. We need a dynamic fully-funded response to this crisis. Now.,2020-02-26 16:26:12,Twitter Web App,99,438,corona; 
Seems like everybody at the table gets that coronavirus is a serious public health crisis... except for the president. https://t.co/MVFj5jOO8m,2020-02-26 00:34:58,Twitter Web App,61,386,corona; 
.@SenSchumer is right. Your request for coronavirus funding was overdue &amp; inadequate. https://t.co/45gVotrNZm,2020-02-26 00:00:41,Twitter Web App,91,590,corona;
