Excellent news! This is further proof of American ingenuity and the strength of free enterprise. @realDonaldTrump's Administration has worked with Pfizer to develop a vaccine in record time. Together we will defeat #COVID19.  https://t.co/B1I1KYdSgG,2020-11-09 18:17:46,Twitter Web App,8,32,covid; 
Nancy Pelosi &amp; Chuck Schumer have blocked targeted COVID19 relief more than 40 times.  @realDonaldTrump has come to the negotiating table while Speaker Pelosi continues to hold aid to the American people hostage. We must provide relief to struggling workers &amp; businesses. https://t.co/0uc5GJed5f,2020-10-19 19:14:07,Twitter Web App,59,86,covid; 
(2/2) #COVID19 legislation should provide targeted aid to Americans struggling with the ongoing pandemic. This is why I signed the discharge petition from @HerreraBeutler which would bypass Nancy Pelosi and provide #PPP funds to small businesses throughout Colorado.,2020-10-01 20:02:36,Twitter Web App,33,78,covid;

Incredibly Dems just voted against @HouseGOP legislation to provide additional funding for COVID testing vaccine development the PPP &amp; law enforcement. Dems have been focusing on a debunked postal service conspiracy theory instead of helping the American people.,2020-08-22 16:23:58,Twitter for iPhone,745,936,covid; 
This is why I joined @GOPLeader on his legislation the Defend COVID Research from Hackers Act which would punish those who seek to steal our #COVID19 vaccines and treatments. We cannot allow the #CCP to get away with stealing American intellectual property any longer. https://t.co/BraVNyp0Hf,2020-07-21 16:45:02,Twitter Web App,11,30,covid;

Thank you Teller County Commisioner Norm Steen and Sheriff Jason Mikesell for meeting today to talk about the process of safely reopening.

At 7 pm MT I will be joining folks at the @TruthLibertyAWM Conference to talk about the many ways I worked to help various non-profit organizations in our community serve those in need during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Watch here: https://t.co/Um6jTwyl3T,2020-06-06 00:38:41,Twitter for iPhone,6,11,covid; 
.@PressSec is correct. Twitter is more concerned with fact-checking @realDonaldTrump than the mass amounts of propaganda coming from the #CCP. They have continued to spread disinformation regarding the coronavirus.,2020-05-28 14:15:27,Twitter Web App,37,89,corona; 
Today @realDonaldTrump said that places of worship are essential. I led a letter to @senatemajldr with 25 of my colleagues calling for liability protections for houses of worship. We must ensure that our faith leaders do not have to worry about the legal costs of #COVIDー19. https://t.co/CpX7700WBm,2020-05-22 20:44:03,Twitter Web App,8,20,covid; 
Thank you @realDonaldTrump for your leadership. The WHO has covered up for China’s negligence &amp; let #COVID19 spread across the globe. Their missteps have left millions infected &amp; led to economic catastrophe. Before receiving funds the WHO must stop pandering to the #CCP. https://t.co/0doeVMTvPj,2020-05-19 15:30:21,Twitter for iPhone,22,43,covid; 
Congrats to @SpaceForceDOD and @ulalaunch for a successful #AtlasV #USSF7 launch! This mission marks the second National Security Space Launch for the U.S. Space Force and was dedicated to those affected by #COVID19 #AmericaStrong https://t.co/who5LdKwcM,2020-05-17 15:01:55,Twitter for iPhone,12,56,covid; 
The @WhiteHouse Task Force has provided more than 646000 N-95 masks &amp; millions of additional PPE. I am very thankful that @realDonaldTrump has made it a priority to protect Coloradans from this invisible enemy. Together we will defeat #COVID19.,2020-05-13 20:15:29,Twitter Web App,17,36,covid; 
I strongly oppose bailouts for states who have a proven track record of bloated spending &amp; waste. Bailouts fail to address the immediate threat of #COVID19 &amp; incentivize further spending on liberal proposals such as the Green New Deal. #RejectBailouts   https://t.co/Qp713gJfVX,2020-05-12 21:00:09,Twitter Web App,33,101,covid; 
#Covid_19 bills should provide targeted aid to those who need it. Pelosi's latest "relief bill" is 1800 pages long and filled with liberal excess. I will stand against this massive $3 trillion Democrat wish list bill. Dems continue to show zero fiscal sanity.,2020-05-12 18:53:21,Twitter Web App,30,121,covid; 
Grocery workers truckers pharmacists &amp; healthcare professionals have worked throughout the #COVID19 pandemic. Who hasn't? Pelosi who refuses to bring the House back into session. @HouseGOP is waiting for her to let the House convene. It's time to get back to work.,2020-05-12 16:47:58,Twitter Web App,10,30,covid; 
I'm thankful that @GOPLeader is focused on the growing threat from China. In addition to covering up the spread of #COVID19 they led a propaganda effort to blame the U.S. &amp; are quickly militarizing the South China Sea. The new China Task Force will hold the #CCP accountable.,2020-05-08 19:16:49,Twitter Web App,649,734,covid; 
This is outrageous! Volunteers who have gone to NY to help fight the #COVID19 pandemic should not have to pay NY state taxes. @realDonaldTrump is correct we should not bailout states that continue to have bloated out of control budgets.  https://t.co/NAdIRw0ia0,2020-05-06 18:45:58,Twitter Web App,29,45,covid; 
Schiff joins a growing number of Democrats and liberal media pundits on the #CCP bandwagon.   He has moved from leading the Soviet-style shampeachment against @realDonaldTrump to protecting the Chinese coverup of #COVID19. https://t.co/zRa7AwAqIU,2020-05-05 18:44:44,Twitter Web App,192,351,covid; 
The #CCP blatantly misled the public in order to stockpile PPE and medical supplies. They are solely responsible for the spread of #COVID19 and must be held accountable.   https://t.co/UeRvjBobf2,2020-05-04 15:33:37,Twitter Web App,33,48,covid; 
If Pelosi truly wanted bipartisan oversight of the #COVID__19 response she would not have put Maxine Waters on the committee. Waters called for the impeachment of @POTUS just 2 weeks into his presidency. This is nothing but the next attempt to impeach @realDonaldTrump.,2020-04-30 18:40:47,Twitter Web App,51,124,covid; 
I am thankful that @VP and @CDCgov now classify first responders for priority #COVID19 testing in response to a letter I sent to the @WhiteHouse taskforce. Our first responders are essential and we must ensure they can continue their tireless work to keep our communities safe. https://t.co/ZPe4uqNarN,2020-04-29 19:02:53,Twitter Web App,4,9,covid; 
The select committee on the #COVID19 response is yet another political hitjob on @realDonaldTrump. This committee would be led by Rep. Clyburn the savior of Biden's campaign &amp; the Rep who said the coronavirus is a perfect time to restructure things to fit their liberal agenda.,2020-04-23 19:27:13,Twitter Web App,22,27,covid; corona; 
Thank you for your outstanding leadership @realDonaldTrump. With unemployment numbers rising due to #COVID19 we must focus on putting Americans back to work. https://t.co/jO41pVxIYy,2020-04-21 20:11:15,Twitter Web App,33,101,covid; 
I am thankful that @realDonaldTrump has taken a robust science-based approach to #COVID19 as well as the economic reopening of our country. The guidelines released by @POTUS will enable the country to remain safe while also allowing Americans to get back to work.,2020-04-17 15:46:12,Twitter Web App,62,279,covid; 
I am pleased to lead a letter with 130 colleagues calling for a #COVID19 treatment that doesn't violate the conscience of millions of Americans. @realDonaldTrump has been one of the most pro-life presidents. During this crisis we shouldn't advance a radical abortion agenda. https://t.co/IVBG9XiPe2,2020-04-14 17:37:24,Twitter Web App,288,783,covid; 
During these troubling times I am very thankful to @iingwen and Taiwan for the 10000 masks being sent to Colorado. Together we can defeat #COVIDー19.,2020-04-10 19:11:04,Twitter for iPhone,56,105,covid; 
Once again Democrats prefer to play politics with the #COVIDー19 response. We have small businesses that are depending on loans from the #PaycheckProtectionProgram and we must ensure that they have the resources they need. We cannot afford more delays from Schumer and Pelosi. https://t.co/Gofn49Mkbl,2020-04-09 15:59:51,Twitter Web App,214,407,covid;

Due to China's lies and misinformation #COVIDー19 was allowed to spread unchecked. This is why I have joined my colleague @RepJimBanks in a resolution that calls on the #CCP to announce that the virus originated in China end detainment of the Uyghurs &amp; end forced labor.,2020-04-01 18:19:22,Twitter Web App,943,1165,covid;

The Chinese Communist Party is a totalitarian regime that has a history of deceit and oppression. It comes as no surprise that they have lied about the numbers of individuals affected by #COVIDー19. The #CCP and China must be held accountable.  https://t.co/Ch0QgyFv4L,2020-04-01 16:14:42,Twitter Web App,885,1024,covid; 
The third #COVID19 spending bill should have given full tax deductibility for contributions made to nonprofits. Our nonprofits are struggling but Speaker Pelosi once again managed to put her interests ahead of the American people.  https://t.co/saywiffFbw,2020-03-31 20:39:27,Twitter Web App,16,28,covid; 
A #COVID19 relief bill should not contain funding for the Kennedy Center. This is one of the myriad elitist wish list proposals crammed into this bill.

I joined my colleagues in calling on @SecAzar to provide immediate relief to rural hospitals.

.@realDonaldTrump is correct. We cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself. We cannot pass this debt on to our children. We cannot keep passing legislation containing liberal wish lists. We must cut the pork from future #COVID19 bills.,2020-03-30 21:00:46,Twitter Web App,122,468,covid; 
After supporting the first two #COVID19 bills I could not support the third $2.2 trillion bill. Aid should be targeted &amp; only go to individuals who need it. It shouldn't go to gov bureaucrats who are still receiving their taxpayer-funded salaries and haven't lost their jobs.,2020-03-30 18:47:15,Twitter Web App,25,108,covid; 
I want to thank our doctors and healthcare professionals on the front-lines facing the #Covid_19 pandemic. Their tireless work during these challenging times does not go unnoticed.

I signed a letter asking the @CDCgov to expedite grant requests for Colorado to combat #COVID19. I am thankful for their quick action and the initial $9.8 million they have sent to support the immediate needs of our state. https://t.co/wMbXem8SIl,2020-03-17 21:03:03,Twitter Web App,2,12,covid;
