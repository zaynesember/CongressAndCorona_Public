Americans deserve to know if CEO’s are abusing the coronavirus-relief to line their own pockets. This information should be public. https://t.co/Zvfb5HYJxC,2020-05-13 17:45:03,Sprout Social,12,31,corona; 
If Trump’s senior officials can immediately be tested for COVID-19 then Americans should be able to as well. It is shameful that we do not have free universal testing for everyone at this point. https://t.co/5c9X9G7DpX,2020-05-12 21:00:20,Sprout Social,7,33,covid; 
Over 5000 meatpacking workers have contracted COVID-19 and 20 people have died.   No one should have to go to work and fear for their health. As states begin to lift stay-at-home orders we must put the safety of their workers first. https://t.co/Diq8ivXlOj,2020-05-12 20:01:08,Sprout Social,4,23,covid; 
Communities of color are more likely to be laid off due to COVID-19.   We cannot ignore the fact that African American and Hispanic workers are bearing the brunt of this economic crisis. Our relief efforts must prioritize communities that need it the most. https://t.co/wP05e9sV7e,2020-05-11 19:00:23,Sprout Social,4,15,covid; 
If Trump is confident in his public response why not let members of his coronavirus task force testify before Congress? We deserve to know how this administration has failed the American people.  https://t.co/5dD4tUclgh,2020-05-06 21:00:12,Sprout Social,5,23,corona; 
Health care workers are losing their jobs or seeing hours cut.  Hospitals are overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients.  People are delaying necessary medical treatments like check-ups.  Any health care system built on making profits will never be good enough. We need #MedicareForAll.,2020-05-04 19:00:27,Sprout Social,29,64,covid; 
It’s clear that communities of color are dying at higher rates due to COVID-19. I support @KamalaHarris in our effort to bring together health care experts community leaders and activists to find ways to address these inequities in our public response. https://t.co/xvb6MDCA5s,2020-05-02 16:00:25,Sprout Social,11,38,covid; 
COVID-19 hurts people of color those without a college degree our youth and low-income folks the hardest. We should prioritize these communities in relief efforts not the wealthy.,2020-04-30 19:00:23,Sprout Social,5,35,covid; 
Universal testing ignores the realities of systemic racism. We know that COVID-19 disproportionately affects communities of color but few testing sites have opened in Black neighborhoods.   We need to give communities hit hardest the resources they need. https://t.co/V7o5OD8JNi,2020-04-29 19:00:23,Sprout Social,7,21,covid; 
African American women are 3-4x more likely to die from childbirth than white women. COVID-19 is already worsening the racial disparities in our health care system and we must take action now to ensure no more women of color die from preventable causes. https://t.co/s97xbhEfiY,2020-04-28 19:00:20,Sprout Social,9,30,covid;

There are countless people sitting in jail that should not be there. If we do not reduce the number of people in jails and prisons health experts project that COVID-19 could claim 100000 more lives than originally projected. It’s cruel and inhumane. https://t.co/wzxTfVmJI6,2020-04-24 21:01:03,Sprout Social,10,19,covid; 
Mitch McConnell would rather bankrupt states than give them financial relief due to COVID-19 cutting thousands of state employees firefighters teachers and social services during a pandemic. Absolutely egregious. https://t.co/zKYA6lTVxm,2020-04-24 16:30:10,Sprout Social,2,16,covid; 
I am proud the Senate included my bill to release racial data in the next set of COVID-19 legislation. This will save lives and help us treat communities hit hardest in times of crisis. As the bill moves to the House it is critical that Congress pass this now.,2020-04-22 16:00:31,Sprout Social,12,82,covid; 
Housing is a public health issue. With over 151000 people experiencing homelessness in CA our most vulnerable are particularly at risk for COVID-19.

No one should lose their health care in a global pandemic.   I’m proud to stand with House Democrats as we fight to ensure Americans who have lost their jobs and their health care as a result of COVID-19 still receive the coverage they deserve. https://t.co/cdvrH3haJQ,2020-04-15 19:00:27,Sprout Social,18,45,covid; 
Communities of color are dying at higher rates from COVID-19. That’s why I am proud to introduce the Equitable Data Collection &amp; Disclosure on COVID-19 Act to mandate the CDC to publish racial data so we can treat communities that are hit the hardest. https://t.co/6iSNfuDYAu,2020-04-15 16:05:03,Sprout Social,12,22,covid; 
I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: COVID-19 is disproportionately killing people of color. We cannot let this go unnoticed.   The CDC must start collecting data on these racial disparities so we can send resources where needed.  https://t.co/BiHJzVXwZ6,2020-04-13 16:28:01,Sprout Social,13,46,covid;

In Louisiana 70% of coronavirus deaths have been African American — but African Americans only make up 32% of the state’s population.   This is an unprecedented and difficult public health crisis that will disproportionately kill communities of color. We cannot stand for this.,2020-04-10 19:36:01,Sprout Social,16,61,corona; 
It is a fact that African Americans are dying at higher rates from COVID-19. We cannot stand for the racism and structural inequalities in our health care system.  I’m calling on the @CDCgov to collect national racial data to help us target resources where they’re needed most.,2020-04-09 22:35:01,Sprout Social,23,93,covid; 
As schools close to slow the spread of the coronavirus we cannot forget that nearly 3 million students nationwide don’t have access to the internet.  Congress must prioritize rural broadband access.  https://t.co/szJQyHu2UT,2020-04-07 18:38:00,Sprout Social,11,43,corona; 
They said COVID-19 would be a great equalizer. And while everyone is susceptible to the virus decades of racist health and economic policies have caused Black people to die from this disease at alarming rates.

Maya Angelou once said “when someone shows you who they are believe them.”   Trump has shown us exactly who he is by mishandling the coronavirus refusing to help states in this public health crisis and spreading misinformation.   We won’t forget.,2020-04-04 23:32:01,Sprout Social,48,282,corona; 
Immigrant communities and communities of color face a greater risk of being exposed to COVID-19. As we allocate resources and prepare for the peak of the virus we must provide these communities with essential protections.  https://t.co/YPVg5bbonc,2020-03-31 18:35:01,Sprout Social,8,20,covid; 
This important legislation ensures that renters in the Bay Area and the nation cannot be evicted from their homes during the COVID-19 pandemic. We must ensure that everyone has access to quality housing no matter their financial situation.,2020-03-26 20:50:39,Twitter Web App,11,62,covid;

As the coronavirus continues to impact families across the country I know how difficult this time is.
