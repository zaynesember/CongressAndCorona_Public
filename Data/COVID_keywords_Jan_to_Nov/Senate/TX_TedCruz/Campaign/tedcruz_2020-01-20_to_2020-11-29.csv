A major win for any American who cherishes our religious liberty. Andrew Cuomo and Democrat elected officials have acted as totalitarians using COVID19 to strip the people of NY of their fundamental right to worship.

Um no you don’t.   Here’s Pelosi telling Wolf Blitzer that if she can’t have 100% of the partisan wish-list passed by House Dems then nothing—NOTHING—will pass for COVID relief:  https://t.co/yTw2O0fTAn https://t.co/4OYHxcgc4i,2020-11-25 00:45:14,Twitter for iPhone,3824,16708,covid; 
.@AOC seems not to know there are Democrats in the Senate.   Or that Joe Biden (also a Dem) is publicly calling on Senate Dems to continue filibustering COVID relief because he thinks it will help them win Georgia. https://t.co/vy5HG3h2qr,2020-11-24 05:03:33,Twitter for iPhone,3033,15656,covid; 
Why is your party filibustering $500 billion in COVID relief?  And Joe Biden is cheering them on. Thinking that blocking relief somehow helps Dems win Georgia. https://t.co/b8PvuUpSa3,2020-11-23 22:02:33,Twitter for iPhone,8743,35744,covid; 
In the past 2 months we’ve  voted TWICE on $500 billion in COVID relief. Both times Senate Dems filibustered the bill.  You should call on your own party to stop blocking relief.  EVERY SINGLE Dem voted to filibuster.  I suspect you never reported on that fact to your viewers. https://t.co/Thsid8ZBbm,2020-11-18 00:03:40,Twitter for iPhone,5334,19135,covid;

An unusually brazen falsehood. Which the media ignores.  Schumer says 20+ Republicans won’t spend “a dime more” on Covid literally AT THE SAME TIME........the Dems are filibustering $500 BILLION in new Covid emergency relief.  52 Republicans are supporting.   ZERO Dems. https://t.co/ueZeatfOCJ,2020-10-20 20:45:05,Twitter for iPhone,4754,10686,covid;

Then why did you &amp; every other Senate Dem filibuster hundreds of billions in emergency Covid relief?  You &amp; Biden are playing politics destroying people’s lives because you think it will help you in the election.

They should show this commentary in journalism school for what not to do.

Yale epidemiologist says hydroxychloroquine is “highly effective” on COVID: “When this inexpensive oral medication is given very early in the course of illness before the virus has had time to multiply beyond control it has shown to be highly effective.” https://t.co/jH3z3NQ3Ei,2020-07-26 15:25:51,Twitter for iPhone,6678,14168,covid; 
Chris seeing the media gleefully report the virus in red states is really sad. And it’s more than a little hypocritical: NY had over 30k Covid deaths; TX has fewer than 5k. (And TX has a 50% larger population.)  Both are too many. We need to unite stay safe &amp; get back to work. https://t.co/PZknNVe1Ab,2020-07-25 19:45:04,Twitter for iPhone,1687,6434,covid;

Spent over an hour yesterday talking to 2 different TX doctors who BOTH told me they are seeing very positive  results using hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID19.
