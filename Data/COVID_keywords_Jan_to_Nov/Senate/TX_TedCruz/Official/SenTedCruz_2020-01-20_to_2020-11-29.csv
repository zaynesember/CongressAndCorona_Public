That’s why I joined @SenRickScott in introducing a bill to protect American medical innovation and counter Chinese aggression.,2020-05-22 19:08:52,Twitter for Advertisers (legacy),904,2152,covid; 
.@SecAzar is exactly right. The consequences of this economic shutdown are serious and dire. As we work to #CombatCOVID19 we must follow sound science and the advice of medical professionals to re-open our economy and get Americans back to work. https://t.co/NcY7niCkSd,2020-05-22 18:35:22,Twitter Web Client,116,420,covid; 
The 3 bills I introduced today will help untangle the U.S. from #China’s web and hold China accountable for hiding the truth about #COVID19 from the world.   It’s clear China is our most dangerous geopolitical threat now and through the next century. We need to act like it. https://t.co/l5XLySGAJf,2020-05-21 18:15:40,Twitter Media Studio,505,1352,covid; 
Today I’m introducing legislation to sanction Chinese officials involved in the ongoing suppression of medical experts journalists and political dissidents amid #China’s censorship of its citizens that is helping fuel the coronavirus pandemic. https://t.co/3E3yvXODG5,2020-05-21 17:44:25,Twitter Web App,1599,1944,corona; 
If the Chinese government had acted responsibly and sought the advice of public health professionals instead of silencing them then it’s possible the #coronavirus could have been contained as a regional outbreak.   Instead we are now dealing with a deadly pandemic. https://t.co/cn25Y9lYeB,2020-05-21 17:22:36,Twitter Web App,1835,2252,corona; 
Testing is crucial as we #CombatCOVID19 and get the American people back to work. That’s why I’ve introduced the Right to Test Act a commonsense solution that will remove regulatory barriers and empower states to approve and distribute tests.,2020-05-21 00:25:10,Twitter for Advertisers (legacy),212,844,covid; 
As states work to #CombatCOVID19 Congress must reduce bureaucratic barriers that limit the availability of tests. The Right to Test Act is a commonsense solution that will empower states to more effectively reduce the spread of this virus.,2020-05-20 17:33:53,Twitter for Advertisers (legacy),79,251,covid; 
REMINDER: The Chinese Communist Party allowed #COVID19 to go global &amp; endanger millions as they secretly stockpiled medical supplies for themselves. They are not interested in a serious investigation. They are only interested in pushing their propaganda. https://t.co/mPuXU16Ue2,2020-05-19 17:53:16,Twitter Web App,1161,2248,covid;

It shouldn’t surprise anyone that the Chinese Communist Party – which hid the #CoronavirusOutbreak from the world – is attaching strings to their $2B @WHO donation &amp; making demands about how &amp; when to conduct a “global review” of the response to #COVID19. https://t.co/QoKIGkhWIv,2020-05-18 22:08:41,Twitter Web Client,499,1194,covid; corona;

We don’t want to unnecessarily delay a recovery from this crisis. We want to encourage people to go back to work as soon as they’re able to go back to work.
