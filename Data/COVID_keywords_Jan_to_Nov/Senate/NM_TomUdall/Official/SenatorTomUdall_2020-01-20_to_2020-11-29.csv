Let's be clear: Senate Republicans want to rush a justice onto #SCOTUS in time to destroy the Affordable Care Act—as we battle a pandemic that’s killed 200000+.

The Trump Bureau of Indian Education showed up unprepared to today's Indian Affairs Committee hearing on COVID-19.  Just like they were unprepared for this pandemic.

The Trump administration MUST ensure that the ban on housing evictions continues.
