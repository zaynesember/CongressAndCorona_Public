What a pleasure to give a Zoom shoutout to all my @ASUSocialWork graduates today! So proud of them as they’re helping Arizonans through this coronavirus emergency. Thanks to ASU Watts College for celebrating our nearly 1400 graduates today. #ForksUp,2020-05-12 23:23:13,Twitter for iPhone,14,130,corona; 
I’m glad to see this decision reversed; the state will continue working with the @ASU &amp; @uarizona coronavirus modeling team.   I plan to rely on their Arizona-specific findings and conclusions in my work to keep Arizonans healthy safe and economically secure. https://t.co/J8AnTXEp9G,2020-05-08 00:10:23,Twitter for iPhone,88,617,corona;

Well it turns out we aren’t on a 14-day downward trend yet.   The CDC guidelines require a state to show 14 days of downward movement of infection/mortality rates before moving to Phase 1 of reopening. Opening too quickly will result in faster spread of coronavirus. https://t.co/Q77NwjwoBY,2020-05-05 17:28:33,Twitter for iPhone,488,1507,corona;

This is a big improvement on data/reporting of the coronavirus and I’m glad to see @AZDHS also is now reporting hospital bed/ventilator availability.   See both links:   https://t.co/WUOPP8S0Sm https://t.co/FOjR25czQZ,2020-04-13 18:31:27,Twitter for iPhone,7,60,corona;

🚨 For those who’ve been arguing the coronavirus isn’t serious enough to close businesses or order #stayathome - here’s yet another warning.   It’s going to get worse in Arizona through April and then even worse in May. Let’s take this seriously let’s #stayhome and save lives. https://t.co/yWq0SnIGkj,2020-04-05 22:46:26,Twitter for iPhone,220,768,corona;

Take a look at the list of states who’ve implemented stay-at-home to protect their citizens and #slowthespread of the coronavirus.   There are 27 states on this list. Arizona isn’t one of them.   Why? https://t.co/tSTK1dqoUq,2020-03-30 17:56:10,Twitter for iPhone,198,711,corona; 
Dr. Birx predicts up to 200000 U.S. coronavirus deaths 'if we do things almost perfectly'  "In some of the metro areas we were late in getting people to follow the 15-day guidelines”  Arizona - @dougducey waited nearly a week. Still no shelter in place. https://t.co/R2AfEs604e,2020-03-30 14:47:13,Twitter for iPhone,175,547,corona; 
Let’s remember that very few Arizonans who have coronavirus symptoms are even getting tested.   We also know that @azdhs expects a massive hospital bed shortage in April/May.   Why isn’t Arizona taking more action to protect its citizens and slow the spread of the virus? https://t.co/pasLDR2gIw,2020-03-28 21:40:36,Twitter for iPhone,310,979,corona; 
As coronavirus is widespread in Arizona but there is virtually no more testing will @dougducey ask Arizonans to #stayhome &amp; slow the spread of the virus?   We can see what’s coming - take a look at New York Washington and California. Let’s prepare NOW so we can save more lives,2020-03-27 14:45:42,Twitter for iPhone,102,399,corona; 
Yesterday Dr. Christ stated the obvious - coronavirus is widespread in Arizona. Since the state has decided to stop almost all testing will @dougducey now protect Greenlee and Gila counties too?,2020-03-27 14:45:42,Twitter for iPhone,35,161,corona; 
I’m re-upping this because literally nothing has changed since yesterday except that more Arizonans have gotten the virus without knowing it.

Let’s all do our part to #FlattenTheCurve and keep our fellow Arizonans healthy and out of the hospitals.   Social distancing is our only weapon against the coronavirus today.   Let’s be the best at it. Stay home for your family friends loved ones &amp; neighbors. #stayhome https://t.co/V5u4LKIfjf,2020-03-26 01:27:29,Twitter for iPhone,54,277,corona;

I’ve never commented about a fellow Senator’s choices/actions. Never once.  This America is absolutely irresponsible. You cannot be near other people while waiting for coronavirus test results.
