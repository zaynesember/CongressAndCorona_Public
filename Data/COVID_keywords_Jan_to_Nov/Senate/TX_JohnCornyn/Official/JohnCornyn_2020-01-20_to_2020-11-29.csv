I am barnstorming Texas (Tyler and Waco today) doing my best to address #COVID19 concerns delivering help to those who need it most and talking to the press at every stop.  So Todd is back in DC waiting by the phone? This is news? https://t.co/cUPEEqaMB6,2020-08-19 14:34:24,Twitter for iPad,67,206,covid; 
Just took a tour of @chcwf and got to see how the CARES Act is helping them keep Wichita Falls safe during the coronavirus pandemic. Always great to see the work our frontline healthcare workers are doing to keep Texans healthy. https://t.co/bGpPMCSpR5,2020-08-19 00:37:48,Twitter for iPhone,6,37,corona; 
Happy to join Mayor Stephen Santellana &amp; @chcwf CEO Alan Patterson today to discuss the great work they are doing to keep Texans safe. Proud to say Wichita Falls has been allocated more than $35 million in federal coronavirus relief funding so far. https://t.co/ir2JOpgRP7,2020-08-19 00:35:42,Twitter for iPhone,6,24,corona;
