The American people deserve to choose the next president and that president should choose the next Supreme Court justice. Nothing that happens this week changes that.

As a school superintendent I always enjoyed the first day of class. That day looked very different this year with #COVID19.

For months Mitch McConnell has failed to negotiate a bipartisan relief package for workers families &amp; businesses suffering from #COVID19.    We have no more time to waste.

.@JoeBiden &amp; @KamalaHarris have fought for the middle class &amp; those who need it most their whole lives.  This isn’t just about Trump’s empty promises &amp; lies.  It's about his record—cutting taxes for wealthy stripping away health care &amp; mishandling COVID-19.  The choice is clear. https://t.co/WMVfPMbAkq,2020-08-21 00:00:16,Twitter Web App,7,31,covid;

COVID-19 created the greatest economic crisis this country has seen since the Great Depression. And the extended unemployment benefits are pumping $50 billion a week into America’s economy.   We have to take action now to #ExtendUI and #SaveThe600.,2020-07-24 19:27:39,Twitter Web App,6,24,covid;

Coloradans deserve a president who will lead our country with a national strategy for COVID-19 testing—not a president who bucks responsibility ignores facts &amp; halts funding during a pandemic.

Today my thoughts are with those who gave what Abraham Lincoln called their last full measure of devotion to our country—those who embodied the best of America.
