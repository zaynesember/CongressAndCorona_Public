Thanks to everyone who joined my #coronavirus tele-town hall yesterday. We had a great conversation on what resources are available to Coloradans and what’s in the new coronavirus stimulus package.

I hear some House Republicans were planning to vote against the emergency coronavirus package because they were worried about how we’re going to pay for it.   That’s interesting…,2020-03-27 17:49:30,TweetDeck,207,979,corona; 
I'm pleased @HHSGov acted quickly after we asked the agency to grant Colorado a Medicaid waiver that will give our Governor and health care providers the resources and flexibility they need to respond more effectively to the #coronavirus crisis.   https://t.co/tlIChfXoeW,2020-03-27 13:45:35,TweetDeck,14,75,corona; 
@SenateDems Now we need to pass this legislation work to fight an all-out war against #COVID19 and then help everyone get back on their feet.,2020-03-25 17:19:26,TweetDeck,53,224,covid; 
Over the past three days @SenateDems have fought relentlessly to strengthen the public health and economic response to #COVID19 as part of a bipartisan negotiation with the administration.   THREAD ⬇️,2020-03-25 17:05:01,TweetDeck,298,982,covid; 
We’ve been pushing hard for immediate help for rural hospitals and health providers in the coronavirus relief package. With federal assistance our rural hospitals can continue to play a critical role on the front lines of this public health crisis. https://t.co/5tpQk76tyr,2020-03-24 20:44:53,TweetDeck,49,201,corona; 
I'm headed to the Senate floor now to demand President Trump take action to address the nationwide equipment shortages that are keeping states and health care providers from effectively responding to the #coronavirus pandemic.

After hearing from Colorado veterans whose GI benefits were at risk amid school closures due to the #coronavirus pandemic we introduced legislation to ensure student veterans will continue to receive their hard-earned benefits even if their school is closed.,2020-03-22 19:28:41,TweetDeck,34,235,corona; 
Last week President Trump told America’s governors to get their own supplies for the #coronavirus pandemic. Many states and health facilities tried but soon found that the supply just isn't there.,2020-03-22 18:43:19,TweetDeck,144,498,corona; 
Rural hospitals and providers across the country are sounding the alarm.   They need immediate cash flow to keep their doors open and pay health care workers during the #COVID19 crisis.   https://t.co/xKzGPXlgbB,2020-03-21 22:44:21,TweetDeck,70,199,covid; 
The #COVID19 pandemic underscores the urgency of ensuring residents of SW Colorado can access critical in-state news &amp; programming.   After years of work thrilled to announce that Denver TV (KMGH &amp; KDVR) via @DISH is finally coming to La Plata County.   https://t.co/s7tgOV25Rl,2020-03-21 04:07:34,TweetDeck,7,67,covid; 
Those are some of the priorities I'll be advocating for. But I know there's a lot more we need to do.   Reply here with what you’d like to see in this next coronavirus economic support package ⬇️,2020-03-21 01:57:12,TweetDeck,12,106,corona;

As our nation responds to the coronavirus pandemic school support staff continue to be the backbone of our communities. That’s why I led my colleagues today in calling for additional funding for schools to ensure they can continue their vital work.    https://t.co/htVdXG7VDW,2020-03-21 01:15:13,TweetDeck,5,56,corona; 
Coloradans in La Plata &amp; Montezuma Counties need access to local news during the #COVID pandemic. Today @SenCoryGardner @RepTipton @COAttnyGeneral and I are calling on all parties to reach at a minimum a temporary solution. Inaction is not an option. https://t.co/AgYPyHeZQS,2020-03-19 21:46:31,TweetDeck,15,61,covid; 
I’m calling on @FCC to expand access to telehealth services in rural areas. The #CoronavirusOutbreak demands that we increase access to health care while limiting in-person visits wherever possible especially for ~45M older Americans at higher risk.   https://t.co/5UW2Q4w1cA,2020-03-19 15:32:49,TweetDeck,24,92,corona; 
The #coronavirus outbreak may leave millions of Americans with lower incomes &amp; lost jobs through no fault of their own. They need us to act.   Today I put out a bold new plan w/ @SenatorBooker @SenSherrodBrown @ChrisMurphyCT &amp; others to help workers endure the economic fallout. https://t.co/3gEOwifaP3,2020-03-18 16:46:59,TweetDeck,87,333,corona; 
Good to talk with @KOAColorado this morning about my efforts to help combat COVID-19.   Check out our conversation on how we must take this crisis seriously by following the guidance of public health professionals and how we must come together as a country to fight this. https://t.co/3MQ7QmvCCB,2020-03-17 20:05:39,TweetDeck,8,54,covid; 
Despite the urgency of this moment @CMSGov has yet to provide the guidance necessary for CO to take advantage of the expanded telehealth services that were secured in the COVID-19 funding bill.   Today I asked them to provide that guidance immediately. https://t.co/3J7BtyWQRx,2020-03-17 02:17:17,TweetDeck,27,147,covid; 
We can't allow the #CoronavirusOutbreak to fall hardest on kids without internet access. Today @SenMarkey @SenBrianSchatz and I called on the @FCC to waive its rules and fund mobile hotspots &amp; home wireless service so more students can learn remotely.   https://t.co/LGUoa4WnP7,2020-03-16 17:52:42,TweetDeck,56,286,corona; 
Last Thursday I urged internet companies to do whatever they could to make broadband accessible to everyone during the #coronavirus outbreak. Dozens of companies have now stepped up &amp; pledged not to cut service for those who can't pay during this crisis.   https://t.co/hKpvjDdhLw,2020-03-14 20:15:31,TweetDeck,55,261,corona;

I am deeply saddened to learn that we lost a Coloradan to a case of COVID-19 today. Our thoughts are with her family friends and community. We will continue to do everything we can to combat the coronavirus and keep Coloradans safe.   https://t.co/1IZukd2iry,2020-03-13 23:22:04,TweetDeck,34,272,covid; corona; 
This is the right move. We are in the midst of public health crisis and the Senate must work on efforts to combat COVID-19 and help American families through this. https://t.co/PyK2kP0uhV,2020-03-12 18:08:28,TweetDeck,48,401,covid; 
.@GovofCO has announced a state of emergency to combat the threat of COVID-19 in Colorado. This decision will give our state increased flexibility to respond to and prevent the spread of the disease.

On Friday I heard from researchers at @ColoradoStateU’s Infectious Disease Research Center about their efforts to develop a COVID-19 vaccine. I’m encouraged these researchers in Fort Collins are working as quickly as they can.

I’m looking forward to my town hall in Fort Collins today. At 10:30 a.m. we’ll kick off a discussion on the issues most important to Coloradans – like our efforts to combat the coronavirus climate change rural infrastructure and more. Tune in here ➡️ https://t.co/fC4Dkbq9Qr,2020-03-06 15:45:11,TweetDeck,13,100,corona; 
With strong bipartisan support Congress has allocated the needed resources to ensure states communities &amp; federal agencies can provide the robust coordinated response the coronavirus outbreak demands. I urge the president to sign it as soon as possible. https://t.co/73GD72vCge,2020-03-05 22:16:24,TweetDeck,11,86,corona; 
The $8.3 billion coronavirus funding package announced today provides at least $9 million for Colorado so our state and local partners on the front lines have the resources they need to fight this emerging public health crisis.

A reminder that putting VP Pence in charge of the coronavirus response doesn’t make up for the astounding number of leadership vacancies this administration has allowed at the national security &amp; health agencies that are critical to our preparedness for this global health crisis.,2020-02-27 02:15:20,TweetDeck,239,1132,corona; 
The Trump Administration's response to the global coronavirus crisis has been pitiful.   It's clear the administration lacks a comprehensive strategy – and the amount of funding requested is woefully insufficient to the scale of this emergency. https://t.co/H3qLLAajG0,2020-02-25 22:40:09,TweetDeck,69,244,corona; 
My staff and I are closely monitoring the situation in Lakewood. The @CDCgov’s new report on the coronavirus is very concerning and we must ensure our federal and state agencies are prepared and have the resources needed to address this potential threat to our public health. https://t.co/x1lIhaKHur,2020-01-25 18:31:14,TweetDeck,123,277,corona;
