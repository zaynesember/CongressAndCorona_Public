We are in a war against COVID-19 and just like wartime we must recognize and reward those who are on the front lines for their selfless efforts to do the critical work of protecting our citizens and keeping our country running so millions of Americans can stay safe at home.,2020-04-07 16:27:58,Twitter Web App,13,52,covid;

It’s #NationalPublicHealthWeek and I'm joining @NPHW &amp; @PublicHealth to raise awareness and build healthier communities.

The Army briefed the White House TWO MONTHS AGO on the severity of #COVID19. Yet another warning ignored as Americans pay the price. https://t.co/BMURcjwMpA,2020-04-06 23:09:47,Twitter Web App,85,207,covid; 
I introduced the Treatment for COVID Act with @SenBooker to provide automatic enrollment in Medicaid for uninsured or under-insured people for all COVID-19 related treatment regardless of income. During this pandemic it's imperative we utilize Medicaid as the safety net it is.,2020-04-02 21:47:47,Twitter Web App,15,85,covid; 
Automatically enroll the uninsured or under-insured who are diagnosed with COVID-19 in Medicaid. Period. No more maniacal obsession with decimating Medicaid. This will be a lifeline to the Americans who become sick or lose their job or their coverage. https://t.co/3WFw6uo5Pi,2020-04-02 21:47:46,Twitter Web App,7,19,covid; 
In Pennsylvania half of all cases of #COVID19 are in younger adults ages 19 to 49. Nationwide about 40% of patients who are sick enough to be hospitalized are ages 20 to 54.

Our Nation is facing a public health crisis yet millions of Americans remain uninsured.

Pennsylvanians: here is an outline of how funding from the recent #COVID19 emergency relief legislation the #CARESAct will reach you. ⬇️  https://t.co/1Q73Nxu2X7,2020-04-01 18:27:53,Twitter for iPhone,13,24,covid; 
NEW: The Commonwealth will receive $170.65 million in new Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) and other HUD programs. I was proud to advocate for this necessary funding to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and the challenges it poses for our families and communities.,2020-04-01 14:21:52,Twitter Web App,12,98,covid; 
Even today efforts to gut your health care continue. President Trump is leading the charge on a lawsuit that if successful will strip health care for tens of millions of people. He reaffirmed his support for the lawsuit just last week IN HIS DAILY CORONAVIRUS BRIEFING.,2020-03-31 22:39:29,Twitter Web App,66,151,corona; 
President Trump and the Administration ignored warnings about COVID-19 and dragged their feet on responding. We’re seeing the consequences of these failures now. https://t.co/okBnwmXKTW,2020-03-31 22:39:28,Twitter Web App,61,149,covid; 
U.S. intelligence agencies were issuing warnings in January and February about the global danger posed by the coronavirus while President Trump and Republicans played down the threat and failed to take action that might have slowed the spread.  https://t.co/okV0F6WARQ,2020-03-31 22:39:28,Twitter Web App,59,144,corona; 
Thank you to @realDonaldTrump for granting PA a major disaster declaration.

#COVID19 is shining a spotlight on our Nation's failure to support workers &amp; families with paid family &amp; medical leave &amp; paid sick days but this isn't a new problem—lack of policies to support women's caregiving work is one of the main drivers of the gender wage gap #equalpayday https://t.co/G7RcCTQZLx,2020-03-31 17:04:51,Twitter Web App,24,64,covid; 
It is outrageous that scammers are seeking to capitalize on the public anxiety of COVID-19.

I applaud @HHSOCR for their focus on ensuring that entities covered by civil rights authorities don't discriminate against people with disabilities when making decisions about their treatment during the #COVID19 pandemic. Our Nation's response cannot leave anyone behind. https://t.co/gA0GxKAHRn,2020-03-30 14:20:18,Twitter Web App,13,38,covid;

My bill also guarantees that the individual would remain covered for the length of their treatment but for no less than one year for all primary and secondary care related to #COVID19 to ensure both immediate needs and downstream issues are covered.,2020-03-26 18:34:06,Twitter Web App,8,41,covid; 
Congress should utilize Medicaid as the social safety net it is.

I am also pleased it includes provisions from my bill the Coronavirus Relief for Seniors and People with Disabilities Act to support seniors at home including new resources &amp; flexibilities for nutrition services &amp; to protect nursing home residents from this terrible virus. /4,2020-03-25 20:12:22,Twitter Web App,5,63,corona;

This #NationalAgDay I'm thinking of the farmers and workers who are braving the front lines of the #COVID19 crisis so that our families can have food on the table. Thank you for helping to sustain life in these challenging times.,2020-03-24 22:00:48,Twitter Web App,15,169,covid; 
My bill the Coronavirus Relief for Seniors and People with Disabilities Act would give older adults the resources and support they need to stay out of hospitals and nursing homes and in their communities. It must be part of any solution to address this pandemic.,2020-03-24 21:24:18,Twitter Web App,19,81,corona; 
Evidence indicates the severity of #COVID19 rises with age. With older adults at higher risk we need to move expeditiously to pass funding to ensure these Americans are taken care of. @ActiveRetirees https://t.co/PphR4IQMIf,2020-03-24 21:24:17,Twitter Web App,29,87,covid; 
While the coronavirus risks American lives President Trump’s efforts to sabotage affordable health care are making it HARDER for Americans to receive the preventative services and treatment they need. /9,2020-03-23 21:55:24,Twitter Web App,5,27,corona; 
The ACA implemented limits on annual and lifetime out-of-pocket costs. If someone contracted the coronavirus and required treatment multiple doctor’s visits or even hospitalization they could be stuck with staggering out-of-pocket costs if Republicans have their way. /7,2020-03-23 21:55:24,Twitter Web App,2,22,corona; 
2.3 million adult children have been able to stay on their parents’ health care plan up to age 26. With many young people also suffering complications from the coronavirus now is not the time for Republicans to take away their insurance. /6,2020-03-23 21:55:23,Twitter Web App,2,24,corona; 
Eliminating the donut hole in Medicare Part D lowered prescription drug costs for 12 million seniors – another high-risk group for developing severe #COVID19 complications. Suddenly losing the ability to afford these often life-saving medications would only increase their risk /5,2020-03-23 21:55:23,Twitter Web App,1,20,covid; 
The ACA implemented protections for over 130 million Americans with pre-existing conditions – one of the groups most likely to develop severe complications from #COVID19. Health insurers could otherwise discriminate against or refuse coverage for these Americans. /3,2020-03-23 21:55:22,Twitter Web App,1,21,covid; 
Less than a week ago Senate Republicans refused to pass the second COVID-19 relief bill until they got a vote on the Afghanistan war and denying benefits to immigrant children – a prime example of the political games of which they’re now falsely accusing Democrats.,2020-03-23 19:54:56,Twitter Web App,18,87,covid; 
10 years ago no one imagined that the #AffordableCareAct would serve as a foundation for care and treatment for an entire country during a pandemic yet here we are – and so much is at stake as Republicans try to overturn it in the midst of America grappling with #COVID19 https://t.co/gPyeVQNY3n,2020-03-23 15:22:14,Twitter Media Studio,98,241,covid; 
Republican politicians spent three years attacking affordable health care leaving families less prepared for #COVID19. The fact that they are even considering a special enrollment period shows the value of the ACA. https://t.co/wegoWH2Ttr,2020-03-22 21:09:46,Twitter for iPhone,60,188,covid; 
2. The Republican draft includes only weak student loan borrower protections to help those struggling to pay off student debt and includes insufficient funding to help institutions of higher ed weather the COVID-19 crisis.,2020-03-22 20:05:23,Twitter Web App,35,127,covid; 
That’s right. #COVID19 testing can and must be free: no questions asked no red tape no politician telling us we can’t afford it.   We’re the greatest country in the world. We can afford it. https://t.co/iHz8yZoy1q,2020-03-21 15:42:09,Twitter for iPhone,95,420,covid;
