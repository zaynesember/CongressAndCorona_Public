The Chinese Communist Party is spreading dangerous &amp; dishonest claims that the US is responsible for the #COVID19 pandemic—a pandemic that originated due to its own incompetence.

Appreciate your efforts @HarmonsGrocery @MySmithsGrocery @Target @Walmart @DollarGeneral and others. https://t.co/82JxE99arV,2020-03-18 21:07:16,Twitter Web App,42,344,covid;

Require insurance plans to temporarily cover telehealth for #COVID19 related services. This would help protect the health workforce and connect patients with providers.,2020-03-16 16:40:38,Twitter Web App,129,1293,covid; 
While the Senate should act swiftly on the House relief bill we also need to work urgently on additional #COVID19 response measures to help families and small businesses. My proposals: https://t.co/62YevTMgCI,2020-03-16 16:40:36,Twitter Web App,457,2260,covid; 
The outbreak of #COVID19 highlights our reliance on foreign-manufactured pharmaceuticals and the risk it poses to our national security.

Our government must partner with pharmaceutical companies to produce a large number of #Coronavirus vaccines once a viable vaccine is found. We can’t rely on countries like China for the manufacturing of pharmaceutical products that are critical to our national security. https://t.co/a6cCVCrGJU,2020-03-03 21:05:32,Twitter Media Studio,43,354,corona; 
Appreciate the efforts of our public health community to slow the transmission of the #Coronavirus. But I’m concerned that only 10% of necessary equipment for medical professionals is stockpiled. Going forward Congress must better prioritize and prepare for situations like this. https://t.co/3H7jz4ohae,2020-03-03 18:51:13,Twitter Media Studio,216,1517,corona; 
In the midst of the Coronavirus Taiwan’s exclusion from the @WHO greatly inhibits the ability for a coordinated global response. This is yet another ploy by the CCP to isolate Taiwan from the global community.,2020-01-31 15:49:43,Twitter for iPhone,1135,2620,corona;
