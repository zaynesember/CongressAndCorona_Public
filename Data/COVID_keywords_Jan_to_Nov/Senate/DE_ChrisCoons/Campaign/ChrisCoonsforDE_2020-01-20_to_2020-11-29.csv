Americans shouldn’t have to learn to live with death. We need a president who will take responsibility and lead not refuse to take responsibility for the devastation of this pandemic. #COVID19 #TeamJoe,2020-10-23 01:20:29,Twitter for iPhone,4,13,covid; 
The Trump-Pence Administration’s COVID response has been an utter failure. It’s that simple.,2020-10-08 01:32:48,Twitter for iPhone,16,42,covid; 
I hope that President and Mrs. Trump get well soon. This is a reminder to all of us that COVID-19 is a dangerous virus. We encourage everyone to continue to stay safe and wear a mask.,2020-10-02 16:11:15,Twitter for iPhone,11,47,covid; 
President Trump’s inability to respond to COVID has been a disaster. And it has cost tens of thousands of American lives.,2020-09-30 01:27:30,Twitter for iPhone,5,44,covid; 
Even though Donald Trump knew how deadly/dangerous COVID-19 was he spent most of the year lying to the American people and intentionally misleading them about the grave risks the virus posed to their health and their loved ones. This is truly egregious. https://t.co/cG0E8OdkY3,2020-09-09 20:12:00,Twitter for iPhone,12,22,covid;

Millions are unemployed and on the brink of homelessness; #COVID19 cases are approaching 5.3 Million and yet the GOP adjourned Senate until Sep. without agreeing to Dem demands for a bill that will sustain Americans for the long haul. This is unconscionable. #BidenHarris2020,2020-08-14 03:32:27,Twitter for iPhone,22,57,covid; 
We will pass a stimulus package that provides the resources and financial relief families and state/local governments need to uphold and sustain Americans beyond the temporary fixes President Trump has offered. We will get through this together that I promise you. #Coronavirus,2020-08-09 04:59:41,Twitter for iPhone,8,28,corona; 
They then stifled medical experts and scientists who tried desperately to help our nation avoid this outcome.   Please know that although Congress has not yet passed another round of much needed #COVID19 aid I am working tirelessly with my Democratic colleagues.,2020-08-09 04:58:45,Twitter for iPhone,6,17,covid; 
We have once again reached a grim milestone as the global leader of new Coronavirus cases with 5 million cases nationally. This is truly tragic given the Trump Administration spent critical time denying this pandemic as a hoax.. https://t.co/aoJ3vg2Aes,2020-08-09 04:56:55,Twitter for iPhone,26,40,corona;

I joined my colleagues in challenging the Trump Admin to investigate and remedy reports of retaliation towards #BIPOC workers who raise #COVID19 concerns in the workplace. Our workers are the backbone of our economy and shouldn't have to work in fear! https://t.co/5HPOeZdP7G,2020-08-05 19:31:44,Twitter Web App,3,5,covid; 
Today I called for the @NIH to prioritize a research plan to assess the short/longterm effects of #COVID19 on our children. There is still so much we don’t understand about this virus and we must make smart informed decisions about school reopenings that protect our youths.,2020-08-04 03:30:56,Twitter for iPhone,10,40,covid; 
Delawareans and people across the US need #COVID19 relief immediately. Please know that I am fighting for you in the Senate so that you won’t have to struggle to make ends meet.

#COVID19 has compounded economic disparities for Black/Brown Americans particularly around housing. I had a call w/Civil Rights + Housing leaders today to discuss bills I am supporting to alleviate this so that housing security is real for all Americans. https://t.co/0VBqZwgoHZ,2020-07-01 15:02:34,Twitter for iPhone,8,13,covid; 
Connections shouldn't determine your economic recovery from COVID-19. I'm proud to join @EWarren in introducing the CORE Act which ensures those that need federal aide the most receive it while also providing accountability for our taxpayers' dollars! https://t.co/PzFt6x7Rfs,2020-06-17 01:20:11,Gain Platform,6,8,covid; 
I am a proud sponsor of the WORK NOW Act which will provide critical financial support to nonprofit organizations who dedicate their time to helping others.

Tomorrow in the Senate we won’t be working on COVID-19 relief. We’ll be voting on yet another extreme right-wing anti-Obamacare judicial nominee.  If you like me have a problem with that let’s work together to take back the Senate this fall.,2020-05-19 21:32:40,Twitter for iPhone,56,168,covid; 
#COVID19 has devastated fisheries fisheries distributors and fisheries processors. @NOAA must give out the fishery disaster assistance fairly and ensure that small states like Delaware and Connecticut get our fair share  https://t.co/S02R4PFiHH,2020-05-13 16:00:07,Gain Platform,0,7,covid; 
Widespread testing for #COVID19 is essential but we still don't have enough tests. @TomCarperforDE and I are calling on China to ease export restrictions on test kits and supplies.

It's absolutely ridiculous that Mitch McConnell has forced the Senate back into session this week *not to pass additional COVID relief* - but to confirm one of his former interns an unqualified 38 year old to a lifetime seat on the federal bench. https://t.co/Z9yLhsoljk,2020-05-06 16:04:47,Gain Platform,42,70,covid; 
For too long the US has relied on other countries for pharmaceutical manufacturing. During #COVID19 it is our healthcare workers who are paying the steepest price.

Dems fought to include another $25 billion for nationwide COVID-19 testing in addition to signifiant support for small businesses and health systems.

Coronavirus is a serious public health challenge but the President and his Administration seem more concerned about how it impacts Trump’s re-election campaign. The American people deserve better.
