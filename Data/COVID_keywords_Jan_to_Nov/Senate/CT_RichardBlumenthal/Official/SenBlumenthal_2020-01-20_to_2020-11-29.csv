Lack of proper medical care exacerbated the COVID-19 crisis on cruises—showing very clearly &amp; dramatically how abysmally inadequate health care on these ships can be.

Even during a pandemic DeVos makes sure the Education Department propagates this administration’s xenophobic agenda.

Facebook’s acquisition of GIPHY is yet another attempt to dominate the market &amp; taunt our competition laws.
