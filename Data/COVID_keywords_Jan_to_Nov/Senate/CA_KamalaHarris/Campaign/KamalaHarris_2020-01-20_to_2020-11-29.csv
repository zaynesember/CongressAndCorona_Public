Tribal health services were already underfunded before this pandemic began. Republicans continue to fight to give tribes less than what they deserve and need in the latest coronavirus relief bill.   Investments for tribal and native communities must be made a priority.,2020-03-25 01:07:11,Twitter for iPhone,1290,4822,corona; 
Coronavirus has upended daily life for millions of Americans. Many won’t make ends meet at the end of this month. Instead this bill gives the Trump administration authority to hand out $500B to corporations without any real protection for workers. I will vote no.,2020-03-22 21:08:01,Twitter for iPhone,7665,37851,corona;

Deborah is over 60 years old and works as a janitor. The building she was cleaning had a confirmed case of coronavirus—but no one told her of the potential exposure. “I felt as if I didn’t matter.”   It's unconscionable.

Domestic workers and caregivers are on the frontlines of the coronavirus pandemic. Many of them are women or people of color who do not have basic protections like paid sick days.
