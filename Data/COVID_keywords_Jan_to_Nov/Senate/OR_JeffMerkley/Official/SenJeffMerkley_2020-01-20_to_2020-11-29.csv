We have a deal on third coronavirus relief package—it prioritizes health care workers families &amp; small businesses. We have to realize that any choice between our lives and our livelihoods is a false choice which is why this package supports both health care + the economy. https://t.co/CxO3ZWoAlW,2020-03-25 16:31:28,Twitter Web App,132,496,corona; 
In my Senate office hoping for a vote on 3rd coronavirus bill &amp; wanted to take a second to talk about another critical issue: getting stranded Oregonians &amp; Americans home ASAP.

Very concerned about state of Corona 3 bill. We can’t shortchange hospitals and health care workers cities and states and small businesses in favor of a big slush fund for huge corporations. Need to take care of workers and families.,2020-03-22 18:37:58,Twitter for iPhone,1709,5374,corona; 
The economic wreckage of the coronavirus is hammering small businesses in virtually every sector. We need bold urgent measures to help them—and the families that rely on them. @ChrisMurphyCT @ChrisVanHollen &amp; I are fighting to do just that: https://t.co/VpjFTgwMFW,2020-03-20 22:43:55,Twitter Web App,84,310,corona; 
As we work on a 3rd coronavirus relief package I'm fighting to keep the focus on working families &amp; small biz.

Congress is starting discussions on a 3rd major #coronavirus stimulus bill &amp; I made clear ANY bill has to have significant resources for housing: helping people keep their homes in the midst of uncertainty + getting homeless into safe housing during this outbreak.

How to rate Senate action on the House package to help Americans face the coronavirus:  ⚪️ Friday evening vote: Pretty good. ⚪️ Saturday: A day late. ⚪️ Sunday: Absurd. ⚪️ Monday.

My office is officially ditching the handshake in an effort to promote good public health in the face of the #coronavirus.
