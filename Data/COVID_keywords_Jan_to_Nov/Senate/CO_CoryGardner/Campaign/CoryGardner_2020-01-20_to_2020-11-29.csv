Last week @Hickenlooper said he supported a targeted relief bill. Chuck Schumer must’ve called him because he now refuses to support add'l COVID relief. If their goal is to make this pandemic as painful as possible it's working - and Coloradans are suffering the consequences. https://t.co/fhVuAaSMfW,2020-10-21 18:01:54,Twitter for iPhone,87,186,covid; 
Since before the pandemic reached our shores I’ve been working hard to protect Coloradans from COVID-19.,2020-10-09 23:23:39,Twitter for iPhone,14,44,covid; 
The result of my COVID-19 test is negative. Pending John @Hickenlooper's result I look forward to seeing John on the debate stage tonight in Pueblo. https://t.co/dE7nDIl3o6,2020-10-02 19:49:24,Twitter for iPhone,43,157,covid; 
I’ve worked hard to deliver for CO — passing trillions in COVID-19 relief listening to people across our entire state and working toward more relief.   But so-called “clean campaigner” @Hickenlooper would rather use his first attack ad ever to spread lies.

I backed forgivable loans so small businesses like Rosie's Diner and their employees could get the help they needed to survive COVID-19 closures. https://t.co/tgUJqhaQw4,2020-09-01 14:04:10,Twitter for iPhone,37,74,covid; 
“For every $1 invested in national parks $10 is returned to the economy.” ➡️ Not only will my Great American Outdoors Act have a lasting economic impact but it also provides much-needed economic relief to Colorado communities hit hardest my COVID-19. https://t.co/c66v2OY6A9,2020-08-28 21:35:23,Twitter for iPhone,6,27,covid; 
Big news for CO. I am proud to lead this effort in the Senate that is poised to bring much-needed economic relief to our mountain counties devastated by #COVID19 https://t.co/SI27RoiSL5,2020-05-26 18:08:53,Twitter for iPhone,6,24,covid; 
Please join me tonight at 7pm MT to observe a moment of silence for those who have lost their lives in Colorado due to #COVID19. We will get through this together. #DoingMyPartCO,2020-05-16 00:39:21,Twitter for iPhone,3,28,covid; 
In a display of thanks to frontline #COVID19 workers— including 600 of their own airmen and soldiers who have been deployed to help fight the virus—  @CONG1860 will be flying over parts of CO this evening. Be sure to look up &amp; give thanks to those who work so hard to protect us. https://t.co/bKbK5qFOeg,2020-05-06 18:36:56,Twitter for iPhone,3,16,covid; 
My top priority is delivering for CO in the midst of this pandemic but we cannot forget the many other issues that impact all Coloradans as we look towards life beyond COVID-19. (1/3) https://t.co/rgFJkXmgzr,2020-05-04 23:40:14,Twitter for iPhone,10,25,covid; 
Don't miss the @AFThunderbirds this Saturday as they fly over 12 Colorado areas to salute our COVID-19 first responders. What an amazing tribute to those who are fighting so hard for us. https://t.co/TksRBrVHHo,2020-04-16 23:57:14,Twitter for iPhone,9,25,covid; 
Colorado companies like Coorstek are using their expertise to deliver on the front lines of the COVID-19 crisis. When we all do our part - companies individuals and leaders - we bring out the best of American innovation and leadership. https://t.co/KjfeBPst5M,2020-04-06 21:19:31,Twitter for iPhone,6,27,covid;
