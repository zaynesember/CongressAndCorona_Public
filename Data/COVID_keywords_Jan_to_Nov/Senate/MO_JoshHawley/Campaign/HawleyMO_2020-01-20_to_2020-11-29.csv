Earlier this morning I sent a letter to the FDA asking for answers on drug shortages due to #coronavirus.

#coronavirus should make it abundantly clear that it’s past time for US industry to move medical and tech-related supply chains out of #China. The dangers are too great - we are too dependent. And the costs to American workers are too high,2020-02-18 18:10:18,Twitter for iPad,287,627,corona;

#China thinks efforts to stop #coronavirus have gone too far? While infections skyrocket and the world is at risk?  https://t.co/Jx13h1YvCP,2020-02-13 20:05:44,Twitter for iPhone,986,1246,corona; 
As #coronavirus accelerates World Health Organization continues its outrageous praise for #China government. What is going on here? Is WHO focused on combating the epidemic or appeasing Beijing? These inappropriate comments damage WHO credibility https://t.co/JdNMGzWDO9,2020-02-13 15:01:37,Twitter for iPhone,2034,3648,corona; 
#China Communist Party has put #HongKong and now the entire world at risk because of the #coronavirus very much including the United States. Beijing’s continued misdirection &amp; misinformation about the scope of the problem is helping fuel a global health crisis https://t.co/xQqlynVBAa,2020-02-12 18:42:49,Twitter for iPhone,2292,3208,corona; 
#china communist party tries distancing itself from #coronavirus. Won’t work. They own this - now a global health crisis. CCP fundamentally corrupt.

Last week I asked federal health &amp; security officials about travel to &amp; from #China given #coronavirus. With worsening conditions since then it’s time to consider restricting all US commercial travel to and from China. Public health must be paramount https://t.co/cMkngC7mQy,2020-01-31 14:49:14,Twitter for iPhone,411,922,corona; 
As deadly #coronavirus spreads this morning I’ve written to the Secretary of State and others to ask whether temporary travel restrictions from affected areas in China may be necessary and if they are when American travelers will be notified. Public safety must be #1 priority,2020-01-24 15:13:15,Twitter for iPad,978,2742,corona;
