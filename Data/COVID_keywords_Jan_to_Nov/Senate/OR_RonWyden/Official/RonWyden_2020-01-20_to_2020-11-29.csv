My provision in the #COVID19 relief bill supercharges unemployment to provide workers with an additional $600 a week. This will be a lifeline for the millions of workers who have been hit by this economic wrecking ball.,2020-04-02 16:50:11,Twitter for iPhone,25,156,covid; 
On day one of negotiations for the #COVID19 relief package I made it clear that my bottom line was helping workers replace lost wages. Modernizing our outdated unemployment system ensures that all workers — including self-employed and gig economy workers — get the help they need. https://t.co/3NwsspRCiu,2020-04-02 15:25:18,Twitter for iPhone,72,288,covid; 
The #OregonWay is on full display in @SpringfieldPS where cooks &amp; others getting meals to students during the #COVID19 crisis got this well-deserved &amp; socially distanced celebration. https://t.co/icYmdl3Epm,2020-04-01 21:35:09,Twitter for iPhone,14,51,covid; 
Workers who have lost their jobs can't afford to wait for help. @SenSanders @SenSchumer and I are asking the Labor Department to expedite distribution of supercharged unemployment we secured in the #COVID19 relief package to get Americans the help they urgently need. https://t.co/RxV4V8R6Ql,2020-04-01 18:49:36,Twitter for iPhone,108,351,covid; 
.@SenSherrodBrown @SenSchumer and I are demanding Steve Mnuchin fulfill his commitment to independent oversight and ensure that #COVID19 emergency relief and loans go to workers and struggling businesses. Not a slush fund to benefit Donald Trump’s friends and donors. https://t.co/vxPTFa4rso,2020-04-01 16:14:58,Twitter for iPhone,176,522,covid; 
An inspiring #OregonWay story in the @Oregonian of how @woodenshoetulp is using tulips to brighten lives in assisted living centers statewide during the #COVID19 public health crisis https://t.co/EuwnPIqpbu,2020-03-31 20:17:39,Twitter for iPhone,43,198,covid; 
NEW: Earlier this week I discovered a crucial error in Trump administration guidance for the #COVID19 relief bill that would block states like Oregon from getting additional Medicaid dollars for home-based care for seniors and patients with disabilities.,2020-03-31 17:33:19,Twitter for iPhone,156,493,covid; 
Good discussion yesterday with Oregon hospitals. Under the #COVID19 relief package hospitals in rural areas and on the front lines can get their Medicare payments up front so they’re able to continue serving patients even when they are short of funds.,2020-03-31 15:11:59,Twitter for iPhone,54,284,covid; 
While I’m here in DC continuing to work on getting #COVID19 assistance that all Oregonians need I’ll also continue highlighting these #OregonWay heroes. In the “replies” please feel free to share similar stories.,2020-03-28 14:31:26,Twitter for iPhone,16,102,covid; 
There are so many wonderful #OregonWay examples to spotlight of Oregonians throughout our state pulling together during the #COVID19 public health crisis.,2020-03-28 14:27:31,Twitter for iPhone,37,191,covid; 
Throughout negotiations of the #COVID19 response package my top priority was ensuring that Oregonians who have lost their jobs because of this crisis could still pay bills and put food on the table. The provision I secured to supercharge unemployment benefits will do just that. https://t.co/9f5hS5wpvm,2020-03-28 00:31:29,Twitter for iPhone,62,281,covid; 
Just finished a phone call with ER docs on the front lines fighting the #COVID19 public health crisis throughout Oregon. Let’s all support these amazing Oregon docs by doing our part to flatten the curve and staying home. This is the #OregonWay.,2020-03-27 23:17:21,Twitter for iPhone,178,888,covid; 
Donald Trump is giving Americans a false choice between fighting the coronavirus and saving the economy. His prescription for helping our economy will only make Americans sicker.  Our economy cannot recover unless we stop the virus.,2020-03-27 20:46:13,Twitter for iPhone,351,1262,corona; 
New estimates today show that unemployed Oregonians will get an estimated $3.3 billion in much-needed help this year as part of the historic unemployment insurance expansion I worked to get into the #COVID19 package: https://t.co/c2OY35w7Au,2020-03-27 18:53:11,Twitter for iPhone,33,120,covid; 
Anyone who knows me knows I prefer a good old-fashioned town hall. But this weekend you’ll find me at my desk taking calls with Oregon businesses and state county and local leaders to answer questions and discuss what the #COVID19 package means for Oregon workers and businesses. https://t.co/BCGmSDeblr,2020-03-26 18:11:56,Twitter for iPhone,47,304,covid; 
My plan in the just-passed #COVID19 package to supercharge unemployment insurance so it makes sense in the 21st century for gig workers &amp; everybody who’s lost their job is explained in this piece I wrote for @ThePortlandTribune https://t.co/DBQmaY9x3E,2020-03-26 17:29:56,Twitter for iPhone,73,219,covid; 
In the middle of the #COVID19 public health crisis there are also many poignant &amp; powerful #OregonWay stories of neighbors helping neighbors.,2020-03-26 15:26:07,Twitter for iPhone,37,117,covid; 
While not a panacea for the health and economic impacts of #COVID19 this package will help American families workers and businesses weather this storm. I will continue fighting for the resources Oregonians and their loved ones need to stay safe and healthy.,2020-03-26 04:01:13,Twitter for iPhone,22,121,covid; 
While pushing corporate bailouts Senate Republicans are also trying to strip my provision to expand unemployment insurance from the #COVID19 package. They are playing partisan games with the livelihoods of workers who will lose their jobs. https://t.co/CwdppNXvFV,2020-03-26 01:19:40,Periscope,511,970,covid; 
When unemployment insurance was created in the 1930s no one ever used the term gig economy worker. The bipartisan #COVID19 deal contains my provision to supercharge unemployment insurance to help ALL workers who have lost their jobs and are feeling an economic impact. https://t.co/jVEJfycVeq,2020-03-25 22:43:43,Twitter for iPhone,104,336,covid; 
In the middle of the #COVID19 public health crisis it’s important for all of us as Oregonians to take a moment to thank all those putting the #OregonWay into practice by working 24-7 to keep people safe.,2020-03-25 20:09:09,Twitter for iPhone,45,277,covid; 
A critical part of preparing for and responding to #COVID19 is ensuring that every American has coverage to see a health care provider. No one should have to choose between putting food on the table and seeking life-saving care. Thanks to the ACA they don't have to.,2020-03-23 19:15:11,Twitter for iPhone,29,126,covid; 
Ten years ago today the Affordable Care Act became law. Since then we've seen countless reminders about why it's so important that every American has access to quality affordable care. Few of these reminders has come as swiftly as the #COVID19 outbreak.,2020-03-23 19:15:10,Twitter for iPhone,85,340,covid; 
I just voted no on the partisan #COVID19  bill. Here's why: while nurses are being forced to make their own masks and gowns McConnell and Trump are busy creating a taxpayer-funded slush fund for their buddies. I will stay here as long it takes to get this done the right way.,2020-03-22 23:09:20,Twitter for iPhone,19015,79735,covid; 
Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump need to accept the fact that the cure for #COVID19 isn't a secretive taxpayer-funded bailout of multinational corporations. This deal will get done but it’s got to get done the right way.,2020-03-22 19:58:21,Twitter for iPhone,118,427,covid; 
Moving forward without a bipartisan deal that gives workers and small businesses the help they need in addition to critical health provisions would add insult to injury for the Americans who are bearing the brunt of #COVID19's economic consequences.,2020-03-22 19:58:19,Twitter for iPhone,180,667,covid; 
Donald Trump hid information about the severity of #COVID19 to save face and now Americans are paying the price. https://t.co/LH4lgkJL2i,2020-03-20 17:15:05,Twitter for iPhone,210,437,covid; 
In light of Donald Trump's failure to swiftly address the global health crisis Congress just passed emergency legislation to provide free #COVID19 testing for every American. This is a good step but I won't stop fighting to get Oregonians the resources they need to stay healthy.,2020-03-18 22:14:05,Twitter for iPhone,183,879,covid; 
I know how @MealsonWheelsPpl has long been a lifeline for older adults. During this #COVID19 outbreak its work is more important than ever. If you’re interested check out all it’s doing and find out how you can help: https://t.co/fcf6SwYtQ3,2020-03-18 21:17:18,Twitter for iPhone,76,120,covid; 
It's official: @SenAmyKlobuchar and I just introduced our bill to require #VoteByMail through November. Mitch McConnell should commit to including our proposal in the next #COVID19 package so states won't be forced to choose between holding elections and keeping people safe.,2020-03-18 20:36:08,Twitter for iPhone,3755,10049,covid; 
Once again Donald Trump is resorting to racism and finger-pointing to hide his failure to step up during a crisis. This is a blatant attempt to distract from the disastrous shortage of #COVID19 tests and the economic pain it's causing as Americans are quarantined. https://t.co/O2KNZLhAiy,2020-03-18 17:04:52,Twitter for iPhone,143,567,covid; 
I talked with @crookedmedia about the urgent need to secure our elections during the #COVID19 crisis by requiring #VoteByMail nationwide through November. America has a long history of moving quickly when our constitutional rights are on the line. This should be no exception. https://t.co/W46vkBCEBt,2020-03-18 15:39:58,Twitter for iPhone,109,326,covid; 
The law already allows disclosure of Americans' location data during emergencies if lives are threatened. It makes sense to consider using location data to notify people who may have been exposed to #COVID19 but only with strict protection for Americans' security and rights. https://t.co/NDujy1bfPq,2020-03-18 14:07:49,Twitter for iPhone,41,146,covid; 
No one is immune to the consequences of #COVID19. The best thing you can do to protect yourself your loved ones and your community is stay at home. https://t.co/aIvZDYzUJF,2020-03-16 18:39:03,Twitter for iPhone,118,428,covid; 
Delaying the tax deadline will help keep Americans safe and lessen the economic burden on workers impacted by #COVID19. This is a must-do. https://t.co/nKPQz3fnqH,2020-03-16 16:22:56,Twitter for iPhone,122,331,covid; 
As the son of a journalist I know reporters play a key role in providing information their communities need daily &amp; especially in challenging times. Glad to see this initiative by Oregon newsrooms across our state during the #COVID19 public health crisis. https://t.co/ArFdhWScoQ,2020-03-15 19:28:32,Twitter for iPhone,63,250,covid; 
🚨The risks posed to elections by #COVID19 are becoming clearer by the day. @SenAmyKlobuchar and I will introduce new legislation to help states use #VoteByMail through November so voters don’t have to choose between exercising their constitutional rights and staying healthy. https://t.co/ZiOusweW8g,2020-03-15 17:32:40,Twitter for iPhone,570,1447,covid; 
Based on my conversations here in Oregon with those on the front lines of this #COVID19 outbreak I know our community will come through this challenge together in the true spirit of the #OregonWay.,2020-03-15 16:15:19,Twitter for iPhone,13,87,covid; 
Oregonians waking up this Sunday to news of our state’s first confirmed #COVID19 death can feel angry about the federal response to this public health crisis.

I’m at home in Portland and was just briefed by health officials on the latest #COVID19 situation in eastern Oregon. Mitch McConnell must bring the House package to the Senate for a vote immediately to bring relief and peace of mind to communities across Oregon and the country. https://t.co/SStBzcCUUu,2020-03-14 19:36:05,Twitter for iPhone,310,1564,covid; 
We need swift science-based action to mitigate the spread and consequences of #COVID19. These Oregon-based doctors have a plan. The Trump administration should listen. https://t.co/OhJlSFJBXJ,2020-03-13 22:16:58,Twitter for iPhone,2138,3214,covid; 
Briefed today at the @vaportland Hospital by officials working hard to keep veterans &amp; their loved ones safe in Oregon &amp; nationwide during #COVID19. They told me all Oregon hospitals having the ability to do on-site tests is key to reduce wait times for results. I agree. https://t.co/15npFxSnCX,2020-03-13 20:59:22,Twitter for iPhone,25,107,covid; 
Oregonians urgently need more testing equipment lab tests surgical masks respirators ventilators &amp; more for #COVID19.

No voter should have to choose between exercising their right to vote and putting their health at risk.

The latest addition to Donald Trump's coronavirus response wish list is a corporate tax change that lobbyists have been demanding nonstop for two years. Let that sink in. https://t.co/dOLJdogPxn,2020-03-10 22:03:16,Twitter Web App,538,938,corona; 
The best way to prevent economic damage is to stop the spread of #COVID19. Donald Trump can't avoid addressing this public health crisis with tax cuts. A payroll tax cut would do little to help workers without paid sick days or those who have lost shifts and tips. https://t.co/5O7WjZnXT5,2020-03-10 15:10:41,Twitter Web App,158,447,covid; 
While not a panacea a provision I helped include in the #COVID19 package to lift telehealth restrictions will help give peace of mind to seniors who see their doctors multiple times a week and rely on them to make more informed decisions about their care. https://t.co/h7OgHEMl5d,2020-03-09 22:04:37,Twitter Web App,55,213,covid; 
Between weakening nursing home emergency preparedness standards and proposing to roll back infectious disease control the Trump administration has weakened protections for America's seniors. Now it’s time for Trump to prove how he's going to keep them safe from #COVID19.,2020-03-06 16:47:44,Twitter Web App,62,140,covid;

Keeping Oregonians healthy and safe especially the most vulnerable is my number one priority. This funding will give states the resources they need to urgently and effectively address the threat posed by #COVID19. https://t.co/wrCpbcAKS8,2020-03-05 20:02:29,Twitter Web App,32,145,covid; 
Today the Senate will vote on legislation to address #COVID19.

This should have been done days ago. I will continue to press the Trump administration on how this action and other efforts will keep America's seniors safe. #COVID19 https://t.co/pOzklZ3U9l,2020-03-04 20:15:56,Twitter Web App,76,182,covid; 
Based on what we know #COVID19 poses a significant health risk to senior citizens and other vulnerable Americans. I’m calling on nursing homes and assisted living facilities to do everything in their power to make sure they're equipped to protect older Americans in their care. https://t.co/Ae9Iyq3GI6,2020-03-04 16:11:39,Twitter Web App,62,187,covid;
