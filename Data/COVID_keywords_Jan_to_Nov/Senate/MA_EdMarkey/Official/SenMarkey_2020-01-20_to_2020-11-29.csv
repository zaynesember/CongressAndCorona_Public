That declaration would allow FEMA access to over $42 billion dollars in the Disaster Relief Fund and support states and communities directly as they deal with the spread of this virus.,2020-03-11 20:47:42,Twitter Web App,31,107,corona; 
As of this afternoon we are officially facing a global pandemic.  We need our response to the coronavirus emergency to match the seriousness of the crisis. Here’s my plan to address #COVID19. THREAD: https://t.co/uoNaKakc0a,2020-03-11 20:47:14,Twitter Media Studio,80,206,covid; corona; 
With all of the uncertainty around the #COVID19 pandemic I want my constituents to be certain of one thing: your safety is my top priority.    I’m on the Senate floor laying out what must be done to combat this public health emergency. Watch LIVE: https://t.co/nLEhqrY7VT,2020-03-11 19:55:59,Twitter Web App,19,94,covid; 
The White House Coronavirus Task Force must be fully supportive of Massachusetts’s on-the-ground response. I’m joining the entire Mass. delegation in urging VP Pence to take swift specific action to support state local and tribal governments as they combat #COVID19. https://t.co/uAk9auRRFr,2020-03-11 18:56:47,Twitter Web App,206,847,covid; corona; 
Due to concerns about the spread of COVID-19 and the state of emergency declared by Governor Baker we have decided to postpone the town hall in Greenfield on Monday March 16th. We very much look forward to rescheduling at an appropriate time. https://t.co/ln8XPN9pkg,2020-03-11 15:46:46,Twitter Web App,7,43,covid; 
The FTC shouldn't allow any consumer to suffer from a scam or predatory business practice during this public health emergency. I’m urging the FTC to immediately develop &amp; deploy a comprehensive plan for protecting consumers during the coronavirus outbreak. https://t.co/WMFElBtuuc,2020-03-11 15:19:00,Twitter Web App,16,44,corona; 
To prevent the spread of #COVID19 Massachusetts residents should stay up to date on the most current facts and information from:  @WHO  @CDCemergency  @HHSGov  @CDCgov  @HealthyBoston  @MassDPH   For more information visit my coronavirus resource page: https://t.co/FGJ6cCtr1q,2020-03-10 20:33:13,Twitter Web App,45,142,covid; corona; 
The White House is proposing to bail out the fossil fuel industry. We need more coronavirus testing not more fracking. We should be working to pass a #GreenNewDeal and deliver climate justice not delivering an unjust payout to Trump’s billionaire oil and gas cronies. https://t.co/DMlmTuyEoX,2020-03-10 19:32:01,Twitter Web App,103,292,corona; 
The Trump admin tried to censor CDC-approved coronavirus information in immigration courthouses including in Boston where my staff confirmed there are no posters in the waiting rooms. This is a dangerous attack on public health in the midst of a crisis. https://t.co/IsRklNTWxP,2020-03-10 15:27:34,Twitter Web App,60,97,corona; 
While I'm glad that some airlines have listened to my call and expanded their coronavirus fee waivers too many travelers are still being left behind. We need industry-wide protection against unfair fees during this public health emergency. #COVID2019  https://t.co/oTMe3WkB2F,2020-03-10 14:41:27,Twitter Web App,14,71,covid; corona; 
Frontline workers — nurses flight attendants educators — are key to responding to coronavirus but their concerns aren’t being heard. VP Pence should add a Labor Dept. representative to his Task Force and consult with unions and their workers. https://t.co/lrNU9poUHU,2020-03-09 22:35:28,Twitter Web App,36,90,corona; 
Any proposal to help the airline industry deal with coronavirus fallout must include passenger protections too. To start DOT should immediately suspend all fees for ticket changes and cancellations during this emergency. https://t.co/2A64SeiBIO,2020-03-09 14:49:37,Twitter Web App,31,110,corona; 
Glad Amazon is responding to my demand to go after sellers taking advantage of people reasonably worried about the coronavirus crisis. All online retailers need to hold accountable predatory price-gougers who are profiting from panic. https://t.co/me7Owg1qJj,2020-03-07 18:24:46,Twitter for iPhone,33,135,corona; 
This is welcome news and I'm pleased Congress is moving quickly to respond to #COVID19. But we need to anticipate and prepare for these threats not just react to them. Congress should also pass my legislation to put $1 billion toward research for a universal coronavirus vaccine. https://t.co/tPTyfCPd9P,2020-03-05 20:22:08,Twitter Web App,7,64,covid; corona; 
Allowing any airline to charge exorbitant fees for ticket changes or cancellations during the coronavirus outbreak is beyond unfair. @SenWarren and I are urging @USDOT to act without delay and suspend all airline ticket cancellation and change fees during this emergency. https://t.co/kd2UtZd93S,2020-03-05 18:32:02,Twitter Web App,50,187,corona; 
We don’t know where the coronavirus will break out next &amp; the flying public is understandably nervous about using airline tickets they have already purchased.  I urge @USDOT to immediately prohibit airlines from charging excessive cancellation &amp; change fees during this emergency. https://t.co/mUiJMHWMsm,2020-03-04 22:38:12,Twitter Media Studio,34,169,corona; 
There are reports of massive mark-ups for products such as hand sanitizer and face masks on https://t.co/gbGcuZeJrP. No one should be allowed to reap a windfall from fear and human suffering. I’m calling on Amazon to stop and prevent coronavirus-inspired price gouging. https://t.co/gE1Xoj9sgh,2020-03-04 20:57:34,Twitter Web App,37,130,corona; 
Even as the world faces a global health crisis with coronavirus Republicans are sticking to their priority: ripping health care away from millions of Americans. The Supreme Court must reject Trump’s attempt to sabotage the ACA &amp; preserve the protections on which millions depend. https://t.co/3lDitSb5Qo,2020-03-02 19:27:12,Twitter Web App,25,79,corona; 
Today I’m introducing legislation to invest $1 billion into research for the creation of a universal coronavirus vaccine. We have the best scientists on the planet and the U.S. should lead the world in containing this crisis and preventing future ones. #COVID19 https://t.co/nG2zYulwCb,2020-03-02 18:31:22,Twitter Web App,23,85,covid; corona; 
President Trump is spreading dangerous lies about this deadly virus. Coronavirus is not a hoax and it is not a partisan pathogen. Trump needs to take this seriously stop using it as a political weapon and understand that it’s a threat to all Americans. https://t.co/OAVGv8vQXa,2020-02-29 18:57:09,Twitter for iPhone,39,99,corona; 
Instead of downplaying the threat of coronavirus like Trump we should put a down-payment on a vaccine. I will introduce legislation that directs a massive investment $1 billion to develop a universal coronavirus vaccine that prevents the next biothreat. https://t.co/ccf0rribmE,2020-02-28 22:43:00,Twitter Web App,17,61,corona; 
We don’t have to pay for our coronavirus response by raiding LIHEAP a critical program that could help 75000 low-income households afford their energy bills. @SenWarren and I are urging the administration to find a new source of emergency funding. https://t.co/ehoKPDqvKt,2020-02-27 19:56:37,Twitter Web App,228,806,corona; 
Today’s decision by the Treasury Dept. to authorize humanitarian trade involving the Central Bank of Iran is a positive reversal especially as Iran’s people face #COVID19. My Iran Diplomacy Act called for this to ensure that humanitarian exceptions aren't just theoretical. https://t.co/5vwGhMEViX,2020-02-27 19:32:18,Twitter Web App,11,37,covid; 
We don’t need Mike Pence we need a dedicated and permanent coronavirus czar whose ONLY job is handling our response to this crisis. https://t.co/EyNOeBfjZO,2020-02-27 01:15:21,Twitter for iPhone,25,176,corona; 
Donald Trump selected a coordinator of the U.S. response to the complex global health threat of the coronavirus who has questioned evolution vaccines and climate change. And also already has a full-time job. https://t.co/L0NoUXKoZq,2020-02-27 01:14:48,Twitter for iPhone,54,147,corona; 
There is no debate about the need for a coronavirus czar. This should have been done as soon as we knew of the threat posed by coronavirus like I’ve been calling for since January. We need clear leadership &amp; honest communication not political posturing. https://t.co/HhRTvxfDvf,2020-02-26 19:22:08,Twitter Web App,6,41,corona; 
I've been asking for a coronavirus "czar" since January but the Trump administration has done little to address this growing threat. https://t.co/ACbsF5r9YP https://t.co/9c330rS2pW,2020-02-25 21:01:51,Twitter Web App,21,77,corona; 
When Ebola threatened global health President Obama appointed a biothreats czar one person empowered to coordinate a government-wide response.   We need the same for the coronavirus. I’m calling for President Trump to immediately appoint a global health chief. https://t.co/NVRn0INMyR https://t.co/HK9hiUyEXI,2020-02-24 21:08:42,Twitter Web App,12,48,corona; 
The Chinese government’s choice to expel American and Australian @WSJ journalists is not just an attack on press freedom. It is also counterproductive at a moment when fact-based reporting can mitigate the harm done by excessive secrecy. #COVID19  https://t.co/3C837SX3nC,2020-02-20 20:52:56,Twitter Web App,1014,1100,covid; 
With three novel coronavirus outbreaks in roughly 18 years and considering the significant impact of this novel coronavirus finding a vaccine that prevents all coronaviruses would be a significant development for global public health.  https://t.co/HG3kM3AO2X,2020-02-03 22:18:26,Twitter Web App,10,21,corona;

The Coronavirus is not the first and will not be the last biothreat the U.S. faces. I’m calling for the appointment of a global health chief - a position established by President Obama in response to the Ebola crisis then eliminated by President Trump - to address the threat. https://t.co/T06u4tGIlY,2020-01-27 16:52:16,Twitter Web App,143,389,corona;
