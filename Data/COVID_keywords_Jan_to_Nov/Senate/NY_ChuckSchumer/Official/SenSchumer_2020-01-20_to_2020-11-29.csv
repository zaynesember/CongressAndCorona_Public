Any emergency Coronavirus funding supplemental Congress approves must include provisions ensuring:  1—Pres. Trump can't transfer the funds to anything other than Coronavirus 2—Vaccines are affordable &amp; available to all who need it 3—State &amp; local governments are reimbursed https://t.co/MPCis40bpq,2020-02-27 00:06:05,Twitter Web App,2830,7709,corona; 
My proposal to bring $8.5B in desperately-needed resources to the global fight against coronavirus:  $1.5B: CDC $3B: Public Health &amp; Social Service Emergency Fund $2B: State &amp; Local reimbursement $1B: USAID Emerging Health Threats Funding $1B: NIH—Rapid Vaccine Development https://t.co/mHVMLBTbUt,2020-02-26 16:04:08,Twitter Web App,2015,5988,corona; 
It seems like President Trump and Larry Kudlow are more concerned about the stock market than the health of Americans.   Here’s an idea: President Trump should try to come up with a plan to address the spread of the Coronavirus. https://t.co/2o0nGR17gb,2020-02-26 03:29:31,Twitter Web App,1310,3643,corona; 
What Pres. Trump needs to do on Coronavirus:  -Reverse CDC cuts -Appoint global health expert to coordinate response -Increase emergency request with no Ebola funding cuts -Expedite diagnostic testing kits -Stop proliferation of junk insurance plans not covering Coronavirus tests https://t.co/EnBVDChy5R,2020-02-26 00:21:46,Twitter Media Studio,3558,9003,corona; 
This is the #DailyLie from the Trump administration.  CDC warns it's not if but when and how many people in America will have severe illness.  Meanwhile Kudlow says the opposite.  This incompetence is dangerous.  President Trump &amp; his admin have no plan to deal with Coronavirus. https://t.co/H144wfwY3x,2020-02-25 23:34:45,Twitter Web App,1081,2458,corona; 
President Trump's asleep at the wheel on Coronavirus  And @SenateGOP's setting up votes for shameless political stunts on divisive anti-choice anti-women anti-family bills  Americans deserve real leadership at the White House on Coronavirus and a Senate that works for Americans https://t.co/lGv8q6Arw1,2020-02-25 22:57:44,Twitter Media Studio,2900,8152,corona; 
CDC is warning it's not a question of if but when and how many people in America will have severe illness.  But Kudlow's saying the opposite.  Trump admin incompetence is stunning dangerous.  President Trump must at the least appoint 1 person to coordinate Coronavirus response. https://t.co/H144wfOzs7,2020-02-25 20:37:52,Twitter Web App,1804,4564,corona; 
President Trump and his administration have no plan to deal with the coronavirus.   NO.    PLAN.    And seemingly no urgency to develop one. https://t.co/nQFMpMfW06,2020-02-25 17:08:17,Twitter Media Studio,4033,9730,corona; 
I didn’t just criticize Pres. Trump’s pathetic inadequate funding request  I noted his incompetence how he has no plan to deal with coronavirus  He’s dismantled NSC’s global health security team wants to cut CDC by 16% hasn’t appointed 1 person to oversee coronavirus response https://t.co/i4CIx1ZGMr,2020-02-25 14:07:42,Twitter for iPhone,8852,26236,corona; 
Just this month: President Trump's administration proposed a 16% cut at CDC.  Today: They tried to answer questions about Coronavirus by saying 'This is what the Centers for Disease Control do.'  This is typical of President Trump’s senseless cuts. It’s his #DailyLie. https://t.co/W7VGfpLLfk,2020-02-25 02:27:05,Twitter Media Studio,1181,1979,corona; 
We’ve seen no sign that President Trump has any plan or urgency to deal with the spread of the Coronavirus.  We need real leadership and we need it fast.,2020-02-25 02:24:36,Twitter Web App,575,2178,corona; 
Too little too late.  That President Trump is trying to steal funds dedicated to fight Ebola is indicative of his towering incompetence and further proof that he and his administration aren’t taking the Coronavirus crisis as seriously as they need to be.  https://t.co/YiwaoMgZmz,2020-02-25 02:24:35,Twitter Web App,1530,3735,corona; 
All of the warning lights are flashing bright red on Coronavirus but the Trump administration appears to have no plan no urgency.   We must get a handle on Coronavirus and make sure the United States is fully prepared to deal with its potentially far-reaching consequences. https://t.co/DaZQ50AvP9,2020-02-25 00:32:41,Twitter Media Studio,2727,8056,corona; 
President Trump has been too soft on President Xi and the Chinese Communist Party as they try to cover up their response to Coronavirus.  President Trump must demand that President Xi end the secrecy and suppression of facts around Coronavirus.  https://t.co/ijTyWuvIXm,2020-02-24 18:03:21,Twitter Web App,1455,2244,corona; 
This is typical of President Trump's senseless budget cuts.  President Trump wants to slash funding for the CDC. His new budget proposes a 16 percent cut at the agency.  But the Coronavirus crisis continues to spread across the globe!,2020-02-24 16:05:00,Twitter Web App,1281,3150,corona; 
The #TrumpBudget proposes cutting overall funding for the Department of Health and Human Services by 9 percent.  That’s the same department in charge of responding to the coronavirus!,2020-02-11 00:20:41,Twitter Web App,587,1225,corona; 
The Chinese Communist Party’s tactics are always the same: deny and deceive.  The CCP must be straight with the world on Coronavirus.  Global health is not something that can be scrubbed by the CCP’s censors.  https://t.co/7mtzFBonAD,2020-02-08 20:36:40,Twitter for iPhone,468,1249,corona; 
While the threat to the American public remains low HHS should follow CDC’s proactive lead: Declare a public health emergency for coronavirus.  This will unlock millions of dollars for CDC to support the agency’s ongoing response to protect public health. https://t.co/esVaaOF8a3,2020-01-27 03:20:46,Twitter for iPhone,1671,4749,corona;
