Charitable organizations are being asked to do more during the COVID crisis when many Americans have less to give. Congress made it easier for some to give through the CARES Act but we can do more to make sure millions more Americans can benefit from the charitable deduction. https://t.co/3j7313x10l,2020-06-09 20:21:36,Twitter Media Studio,19,72,covid;

.@realDonaldTrump is right to defund the WHO. @DrTedros and his senior staff should resign. The U.S. should spend the taxpayer money wasted on WHO to provide relief from COVID-19 directly on those impacted instead. https://t.co/EDbcswQPCX,2020-05-20 14:10:25,Twitter Web App,314,1100,covid;

That’s why a one-year charitable deduction is essential to a comprehensive coronavirus relief package. Rs and Ds are ready to #GoBig4Charity. We just need the chance to show it.

The Coronavirus is a real emergency and the federal government can and should act to mitigate the economic pain from this situation. Unfortunately this House response bill is Rube Goldberg machine of unfunded mandates and tax benefits that will only end up hurting workers.,2020-03-18 20:30:59,Twitter for iPhone,161,619,corona; 
We all agree workers affected by the Coronavirus need financial assistance. The only question is how to finance it. The House bill forces businesses to front the money. Instead our amendment would give workers cash directly from govt. https://t.co/xzg0oZlAaI,2020-03-18 17:26:24,Twitter Web App,44,152,corona;

@realDonaldTrump:  Per your concerns we should delay consideration of expiring FISA provisions for 45 days—reauthorizing for a few weeks to give us time to improve the FISA bill passed by House Democrats.  That would give us time to deal with COVID19 and then fix FISA. https://t.co/Pd0Flh2KLf,2020-03-12 18:58:58,Twitter for iPhone,57,173,covid;
