The White House ignored the threat of COVID-19 until it was too late to stop it left states without the equipment to fight it &amp; didn’t track its spread to contain it.

We need more COVID-19 tests more PPE &amp; a vaccine – &amp; a federal government that can distribute them at scale. Which is why Trump &amp; @VP Pence should be using the DPA now &amp; championing my bill to publicly manufacture COVID-19 supplies. https://t.co/XmNue8wKTJ,2020-06-17 01:13:49,Twitter Web App,543,2421,covid;

I also joined @SenMarkey in opposing a proposal to pull funds from the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program – which helps families in MA &amp; around the country stay warm – to fund the coronavirus response. https://t.co/4i2vAsTugu,2020-03-02 20:24:56,Twitter Web App,172,742,corona; 
When news reports broke that the administration placed 14 Americans infected with coronavirus on plane with healthy passengers I requested info from the @StateDept @HHSGov &amp; @CDCgov about their chain of command for making these public health decisions. https://t.co/rsFKLuKJW0,2020-03-02 20:24:55,Twitter Web App,259,895,corona; 
The coronavirus response is also about leadership. @PattyMurray &amp; I led 25 of our colleagues in urging the @WHNSC to fill the head of global health security position that's been vacant for almost 2 years with an expert who can address the coronavirus.   https://t.co/FZJwwvP41q,2020-03-02 20:24:55,Twitter Web App,219,784,corona; 
I also joined @SenFeinstein on a bipartisan letter calling on @HHSGov to establish clear guidelines for how state &amp; local governments will be reimbursed for costs related to assisting the federal coronavirus response. https://t.co/AKaAL2piKP,2020-03-02 20:24:54,Twitter Web App,196,813,corona; 
Two weeks ago I was one of the 25 @SenateDems who pressed @HHSGov &amp; OMB to request emergency funding for the coronavirus outbreak &amp; raised concerns that they’d failed to share details about the resources they needed. https://t.co/Or2BPgvbvj,2020-03-02 20:24:54,Twitter Web App,210,839,corona; 
I also worked with @SenAngusKing to ask @USAID why they were shuttering PREDICT a program established to identify &amp; combat viruses that may generate global pandemics including coronaviruses. https://t.co/cSMKyuBx4w,2020-03-02 20:24:53,Twitter Web App,221,838,corona; 
Over a month ago HELP Committee ranking member @PattyMurray &amp; I – along with a group of @SenateDems – asked @SecAzar for an update on @HHSGov’s comprehensive response plan to the coronavirus threat. https://t.co/yedM6EZdVZ,2020-03-02 20:24:53,Twitter Web App,184,796,corona; 
In December I joined @SenTomCotton @SenatorRomney &amp; Senator Kaine in asking the @DeptofDefense about the national security risks posed by America’s reliance on China for pharmaceutical products – a problem that coronavirus has magnified in recent weeks. https://t.co/Wnmp0i42d5,2020-03-02 20:24:53,Twitter Web App,223,924,corona; 
We need to make sure that the Trump administration is effectively responding to the coronavirus outbreak. That’s why I wanted to recap some of the work my office has done over the past few weeks to hold this administration accountable to the American people:,2020-03-02 20:24:52,Twitter Web App,2303,13275,corona; 
Coronavirus may close businesses &amp; hurt supply chains tourism travel &amp; many economic factors. Closed businesses have problems repaying loans. Working families have a right to know what big banks are doing to keep our economy safe.,2020-02-29 00:02:06,Twitter for iPhone,295,1471,corona; 
Coronavirus not only threatens our global health – it also threatens the global economy. I’ve requested information from 5 Too Big to Fail banks about how they’re monitoring &amp; managing this financial risk. https://t.co/C56nZOofgL,2020-02-29 00:02:05,Twitter for iPhone,956,4194,corona; 
Iran has the most coronavirus deaths outside China. Although US sanctions exempt humanitarian items I’m concerned that in practice sanctions may be limiting access to basic medical supplies to help the Iranian people. I want info from @USTreasury &amp; @StateDept. https://t.co/TEDSL1PMKV,2020-02-28 21:51:16,Twitter for iPhone,1505,6104,corona; 
We need a strong &amp; rapid response to the coronavirus threat. But the govt shouldn't raid the program that helps low-income families stay safe &amp; warm in their homes to pay for it. @SenMarkey &amp; I told @SecAzar not to endanger the life-saving LIHEAP program. https://t.co/9aOExX4d7q,2020-02-28 00:39:42,Twitter Web App,754,2888,corona; 
Coronavirus poses a serious health diplomatic &amp; economic threat &amp; we must be prepared to confront it head-on. So I’m introducing a bill to transfer all funding for @realDonaldTrump's racist border wall to @HHSGov &amp; @USAID to combat coronavirus. https://t.co/8IEhBWRjeL https://t.co/9oAF0A2lGT,2020-02-27 15:28:27,Twitter Web App,5727,26474,corona; 
HHS's job is to “protect the health &amp; well-being of all Americans” not just the rich. Scientists are racing to develop a coronavirus vaccine but it won't help if people can't afford it. HHS must get vaccines to people in need not pad Pharma's pockets. https://t.co/TwqItWd2m9,2020-02-27 00:39:08,Twitter Web App,1108,4310,corona; 
The last thing we need is an administration bickering &amp; finger-pointing during a public health emergency. Our agencies need a clear chain of command for public health decisions in the days ahead &amp; an integrated process for responding to coronavirus.,2020-02-26 23:22:37,Twitter Web App,372,2093,corona; 
Trump administration officials will make many tough decisions about coronavirus. But one of their first big ones – deciding to evacuate 14 infected Americans on a plane with healthy passengers – was riddled with disagreement &amp; confusion. I want answers. https://t.co/rsFKLuKJW0,2020-02-26 23:22:37,Twitter Web App,1652,5756,corona; 
The @WHNSC head of global health security left the WH 2 years ago. During a coronavirus outbreak the position is still vacant. @PattyMurray &amp; I are leading 25 of our colleagues in urging the NSC to appoint a global health expert to address this virus. https://t.co/FZJwwvP41q,2020-02-13 21:05:59,Twitter Web App,297,938,corona; 
And in the middle of a global coronavirus outbreak this is where President Trump’s budget cuts USAID’s global health funds by over $1 billion &amp; the CDC’s budget by almost $700 million including a $35 million cut to a key infectious disease response fund. https://t.co/wsRjlzyNwY,2020-02-11 20:12:08,Twitter Web App,104,237,corona; 
I'm concerned about the global coronavirus outbreak &amp; committed to fighting this virus.
