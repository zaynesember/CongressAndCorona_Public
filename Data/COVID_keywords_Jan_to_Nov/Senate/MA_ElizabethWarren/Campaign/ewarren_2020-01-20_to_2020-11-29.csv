After Ebola Congress invested to prevent pandemics like coronavirus. Donald Trump tried to cut that funding. As president I’ll fully fund global health security research on medical countermeasures and public health capacity at home to keep us safe and healthy. https://t.co/h9B0ZhH6cU,2020-01-22 20:27:55,Twitter Web App,721,3727,corona;
