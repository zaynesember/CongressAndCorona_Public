Great reminder from my friend French Hill to donate blood if you are able. Contact @ArkRedCross or @ABIblood to find the nearest donation center near you and make an appointment. It’s needed urgently. THANK YOU to those helping meet this need or serving in other ways. #COVID19Ark https://t.co/8O8pgIolW9,2020-04-04 14:33:56,Twitter for iPhone,1,5,covid; 
Blood donations🩸are still needed even amid the #COVID19 crisis. If you’re healthy &amp; able please consider giving blood. It can help save lives.  RT to get the word out. We’re in this together and I know Arkansans will continue to serve each other well - as we always do. #arnews https://t.co/VMqaVj1tY7,2020-03-20 00:46:14,Twitter for iPhone,4,5,covid;
