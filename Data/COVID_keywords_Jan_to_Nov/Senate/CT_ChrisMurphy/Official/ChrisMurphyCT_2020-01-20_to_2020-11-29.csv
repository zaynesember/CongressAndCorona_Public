3/ Trump and his team have screwed up every logistical element of COVID response so far. 80% of nurses say they don't have adequate PPE. Many have to wait in 3 hour lines for a test. Why would Trump's vaccine plan be magically different?  https://t.co/LbbHIP4sfT,2020-11-20 22:02:22,Twitter Web App,526,2863,covid; 
The apparent success of the Moderna vaccine is great news. But it's vaccinations not vaccines alone that will help us turn the corner on COVID. That is why Trump's petty delusional refusal share information with President-elect Biden on vaccination planning is so unforgivable.,2020-11-16 16:01:18,Twitter Web App,2336,13484,covid; 
Obama is right. Trump thinks doctors must be profiting off treating COVID because Trump CANNOT CONCEIVE of anyone doing anything simply because it's the right thing to do.,2020-10-31 18:20:52,Twitter Web App,6193,29356,covid; 
Honestly if you’re still on the fence just an FYI - the President said today that doctors want more people to die of COVID so they can get paid more.   He’s a monster - if you didn’t know.  (btw that’s not how medical billing works FYI),2020-10-30 22:58:41,Twitter for iPhone,5198,22880,covid; 
I bought breakfast sandwiches for the staff at Hartford Hospital this morning.   Then we talked about why we all need to do our part to prevent a third wave of #COVID in Connecticut. Keep wearing masks. Keep social distancing. I know it’s hard but we have to stay at it. https://t.co/vz5bpZIaM7,2020-10-28 17:04:17,Twitter for iPhone,99,1012,covid; 
At this point we would be better off if the Trump Administration just did NOTHING on #COVID19. The nation would be safer if the whole White House stayed in bed all day.   The mask shaming the rallies the unrealistic promises on vaccines - it’s killing people. https://t.co/45NW1WY0aR,2020-10-25 20:23:26,Twitter for iPhone,1262,5681,covid; 
We are setting daily records for #COVID19 cases nationally and today nonprofit universities (who are begging Congress for pandemic relief money) held dozens of superspeader events in stadiums all across the country. Just bananas.,2020-10-25 02:48:09,Twitter for iPhone,571,2922,covid; 
This is such an important part of the story of Trump's catastrophic failure. Just at the moment that America was already losing too much economic ground to China America's refusal to get COVID under control has accelerated China's advantage. https://t.co/r268yWM4cB,2020-10-19 14:47:12,Twitter Web App,343,752,covid; 
If it makes you feel better keep believing Fauci and Redfield are in charge of #COVID19 response.   But they aren't. This guy is. Scott Atlas is Trump's current top COVID advisor. And Atlas DOES NOT BELIEVE IN SCIENCE. Tip of the iceberg? He believes masks are a conspiracy. https://t.co/XV9t1Fbukc,2020-10-18 14:36:08,Twitter Web App,664,1439,covid; 
Wisconsin is experiencing a #COVID19 surge right now. And 8 of 10 attendees at Trump’s rally today are wearing masks. Virtually no one is social distancing.

No President in American history has been better for China than Donald Trump.

Admittedly the CDC has issued three different rules in 2 months (due to political pressure from the White House).  But...the rule currently is this: if you've been within 6 ft of a person with COVID for more than 15 minutes or if you've touched them you need to quarantine.,2020-10-05 15:55:48,Twitter Web App,265,1156,covid; 
Hey - my friend @JohnBKing Obama's Secretary of Education is launching a new progressive org today dedicated to building better after COVID in his home state of Maryland. Looks important. Check out the launch video here: https://t.co/JQ2ltiRIoo,2020-10-05 13:36:44,Twitter Web App,82,245,covid; 
2/ Here is the relevant section from the CDC website on people who have been in contact with a COVID positive person:  "Even if you test negative for COVID-19 or feel healthy you should stay home (quarantine) since symptoms may appear 2 to 14 days after exposure to the virus.",2020-10-02 15:30:01,Twitter Web App,1349,6205,covid; 
Let's be clear...COVID didn't sneak up on the President.   Since the spring the White House has had multiple positive cases including several people who have direct contact with Trump. And yet he didn't wear a mask at public events or private meetings at the White House. https://t.co/1tDwWsoQE4,2020-10-02 13:08:42,Twitter Web App,2396,8360,covid; 
Here's how this works:  1. Republicans put radical Amy Coney Barrett on the Supreme Court.  2. She provides the 5th vote to strike down the ACA ending protections for preexisting conditions.  3. Insurers make COVID diagnosis a preexisting  condition.  4. We all get screwed.,2020-10-01 12:56:28,Twitter Web App,9760,26452,covid; 
Instead of spending the fall trying to save lives by fighting #COVID19 President Trump is going to use September and October to end people's lives by ramming through a Supreme Court nominee who will vote to end health insurance for 23 million Americans.,2020-09-25 13:26:07,Twitter Web App,1902,4552,covid; 
On 6/20 Trump said "When you do testing...you find more cases. So I said to my people slow the testing down please."  On 8/24 CDC issued new rules contradicting established science telling those who had been in close contact with people w/ COVID they didn't need a test.  FYI.,2020-09-25 12:57:24,Twitter Web App,380,1102,covid; 
Just imagine if Mitch McConnell worked as hard at helping the country confront COVID as he does ramming through right wing Supreme Court judges.  We wouldn't have 200000 dead right now.,2020-09-23 00:22:49,Twitter Web App,6921,31358,covid; 
If Republicans ram through a right wing nominee to the Supreme Court the Affordable Care Act will be repealed. Within months.   Rates will skyrocket for people with preexisting conditions.   And FYI see below - COVID will be a preexisting condition.  https://t.co/M5xfJonrV8,2020-09-22 13:59:45,Twitter for iPhone,408,664,covid; 
Heads up - anybody in this country who has had COVID or ever tests positive for the COVID antibodies has a preexisting condition.  And when Trump rams through an anti-health care judge and the ACA is eliminated your rates are going through the roof.   FYI.,2020-09-21 13:07:07,Twitter Web App,31706,80334,covid; 
Get well Jahana. And thanks for sharing your story.   But if you want to know why 200000 have died here it is.   If we had a halfway competent President who built a national testing program it wouldn’t be this hard to find out if you are actively spreading COVID. https://t.co/OqTBRuhWGW,2020-09-20 18:00:57,Twitter for iPhone,213,812,covid; 
This is extraordinary. Please watch ASAP.  “Maybe this COVID thing is a good thing” Trump said at a task force meeting. “I don’t like shaking hands with people. I don’t have to shake hands with these disgusting people.” https://t.co/iEw7nLaIfo,2020-09-18 18:08:52,Twitter for iPhone,38,75,covid; 
Why do we need Branstad to tell us this? Trump didn’t hide it at all!  In early 2020 he was the world’s number one cheerleader for China’s coronavirus response making 40+ different statements praising Beijing. https://t.co/zUshj0TXJA,2020-09-18 16:45:55,Twitter for iPhone,117,366,corona;

Of course this recommendation didn’t come from doctors at the CDC.   No doctor in their right mind would tell someone who had been in close contact with someone w COVID to NOT get tested.

860000 Americans filed for unemployment last week. 1200 people died of COVID yesterday.   A halfway competent President would have beat COVID within the first few months.

It was like a one day story but it’s just mind blowing that CDC dropped its recommendation that everyone (regardless of symptoms) get tested if they had contact with someone who is COVID positive.  This has no basis in good science. It just means “less testing” like Trump wants.,2020-09-17 14:46:59,Twitter for iPhone,565,1796,covid;

This is good news and a model for other universities to follow.  One of the tragedies of COVID in America is that we know what do to - but too many states and institutions refuse to follow the model and Trump doesn't allow the federal government to spread the model. https://t.co/wKFOvvWC1U,2020-09-01 13:00:46,Twitter Web App,62,283,covid; 
4/ And they KNOW that masks/social distancing have proven to save lives (see the NIH Director below).  So for no good reason they chose a path that will make it harder to beat COVID and would lead to more people dying.

I'm a huge sports fan. I want college football to come back if it's safe.

Great news: The draft of the new House relief bill includes language authorizing the U.S. to join CEPI the international effort to find a COVID vaccine.  Trump's refusal to join CEPI is as inexplicable as it is dangerous.  Thanks to @RepBera who pushed for this.,2020-05-12 20:00:44,Twitter Web App,495,1982,covid; 
I just don’t understand why Trump wants a fight over China.   His dumb trade war cost us 300000 jobs.  He was the world’s top apologist for China’s Coronavirus response in the critical early days.  And he owes the Bank of China millions.  How does focus on China policy help him?,2020-05-12 00:38:45,Twitter for iPhone,1411,5379,corona; 
Trump’s decision to not join CEPI the international consortium working on a Coronavirus vaccine is so so dangerous.   Why voluntarily leave ourselves outside the room? https://t.co/BxaJvAColZ,2020-05-11 04:03:18,Twitter for iPhone,600,1835,corona; 
There is an international organization called CEPI which includes almost all our allies working right now to find a vaccine for coronavirus.   Trump refuses to join.  It's foreign policy malpractice that could prove fatal and Congress must fix this in the next relief bill.,2020-05-07 02:40:20,Twitter Web App,2138,5589,corona;

5/ So this is a NO BRAINER - in the next Coronavirus relief bill Congress should require the Trump Administration to join CEPI and make a contribution to their work.  Maybe we find a vaccine in the U.S. first - but if a CEPI partner finds it we want be part of the team.,2020-05-05 22:49:03,Twitter Web App,1129,5336,corona; 
4/ And so when CEPI began work on a vaccine for Coronavirus the United States was left on the outside. This means that if CEPI develops a vaccine it will likely give preference to its members.

Fact:  We would be in an infinitely better position if Trump had responded to Coronavirus like Obama/Biden responded to H1N1.

1. There is a shortage of the Coronavirus testing reagent.   2. Much of the reagent supply comes from Europe.   3.

Trump has put no one in charge of Coronavirus.  He is pushing cuts to the budgets of all the agencies that fight pandemics.   He shut down 37 of 47 global anti-pandemic programs.

@brianschatz It’s hard to comprehend. Their response to Coronavirus is to literally RAMP DOWN efforts to fight Coronavirus.   A 34% cut would mean massive layoffs of the people who are trying to stop pandemic diseases from hitting the U.S.,2020-02-10 22:09:16,Twitter for iPhone,1254,3104,corona;

3 things that should happen ASAP to protect the U.S. from Coronavirus:  1. Trump should reinstate the NSC anti-outbreak position he eliminated.  2.
