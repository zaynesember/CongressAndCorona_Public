Listen to a real hero. Dr. George Fareed is on the front line treating COVID patients. He joined me on the Sean Hannity Radio Show (hosted by @rose_unplugged) talking about last week's Senate hearing on early treatments for #COVID19 @cov19treatments : https://t.co/ueBI8J7pq6,2020-11-25 16:14:00,Twitter for iPhone,46,130,covid; 
Fact check. Not true @js_newswatch.  I have held SEVEN hearings on the pandemic.  First sentence also misleading. There are many doctors deeply concerned about the lack of early treatment options for #COVID19.  Watch the hearing for yourself: https://t.co/BGkRoOE7cX https://t.co/ZxiCmTLD1n,2020-11-25 00:36:51,Twitter Web App,72,198,covid; 
Eye-opening testimony last week during our Senate hearing on early treatments for #COVID19.   There is a real disconnect between Ivory Tower academic medical professionals and those in trenches treating sick and dying patients. https://t.co/sxCYlY2riy,2020-11-23 02:46:00,Twitter Media Studio,868,1973,covid;

If Nancy and Chuck are serious about wanting to help the unemployed small businesses parents schools and protect Americans from Covid just say YES to the relief bill 52 Republican Senators supported that provides that help. Our children don’t need $2 trillion more debt.,2020-10-10 20:59:57,Twitter for iPhone,1047,2000,covid; 
Such a shame the Democrats won't look at areas of agreement for #coronavirus relief.   We agree on more money for... ➡️unemployed workers ➡️small business ➡️education ➡️vaccines/testing  Why won't they say yes to that? @greta https://t.co/H4xPIy9uC3,2020-09-14 17:17:09,Twitter Media Studio,219,395,corona; 
It’s unfortunate Democrats won’t take yes for an answer. Once again they have taken the position it’s either their way or the highway for #coronavirus relief. https://t.co/785W1pyqwX,2020-09-10 20:43:19,Twitter for iPhone,440,619,corona;

Today's #HSGAC hearing on @USPS finances and operations put a spotlight on false narratives being pushed by Democrats.  Did you know USPS earned $1.5 billion more during COVID-19 than during the same period last year? https://t.co/nOm2tt3hJq,2020-08-21 19:13:39,Twitter Web App,246,370,covid; 
✅Fact: Over a trillion dollars still hasn't been spent from the first  coronavirus relief package. https://t.co/PiTUo9fFHi,2020-08-07 00:40:00,Twitter Media Studio,160,232,corona; 
We still haven't spent (or even obligated) $1.2 trillion of coronavirus relief money.  So why don't we look at what we spent what's left over what worked what didn't and then really target financial relief to the people and businesses that truly need it? https://t.co/OuSnHAHfvz,2020-08-06 18:57:45,Twitter Media Studio,138,296,corona; 
Let this sink in.   We’ve authorized enough #COVID19 relief spending to replace 13.5% of annual economic output and more than $1 trillion of it hasn’t yet been spent or obligated.  No more blank checks.   https://t.co/osHNEKDZve,2020-07-24 18:53:51,Twitter Web App,192,449,covid; 
Congress authorized nearly $3 trillion in  #COVID19 relief and we're talking about spending more.   But more than $1 trillion still hasn't been spent or obligated.   Congress should not be handing out blank checks until we see what worked &amp; what didn't. https://t.co/IGrDolrkT7,2020-07-23 20:47:40,Twitter Web App,166,324,covid; 
Businesses of all sizes remain either totally or significantly shut down months into the coronavirus pandemic. #PPP provided short-term financial support but now Congress needs to think outside the box to help.  https://t.co/i2lexeahun,2020-07-22 01:03:05,Twitter Web App,16,57,corona;

All of us need to do our part. That starts by taking our situation seriously and following Dr. Price’s good advice to avoid contracting or spreading #COVIDー19. We don’t have to shut down our entire economy to accomplish that. @RealClearNews https://t.co/7LwkriBpCL,2020-04-01 23:15:00,TweetDeck,16,49,covid; 
I'm highlighting this #COVID19 video in @RealClearNews  because it's important we don’t become gripped with fear or allow panic to sweep our society.
