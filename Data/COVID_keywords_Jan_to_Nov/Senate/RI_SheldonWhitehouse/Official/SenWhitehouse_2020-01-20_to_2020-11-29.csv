It’s a scandal to loot taxpayers during an economic and human tragedy but that’s exactly what Republicans did in the #COVID19 relief bill.   https://t.co/m0t1SNtDSJ,2020-04-14 18:19:02,Twitter Web App,88,101,covid; 
The Trump administration bungled distributing critical medical supplies &amp; equipment to those fighting #COVID19 on the front lines.   That’s why I’ve joined with @SenJackReed &amp; other Democrats to ask VP Pence what’s being done to fix the problem.  https://t.co/y1xSGGRfZk,2020-04-14 13:48:02,Twitter Web App,83,270,covid; 
Republicans included a completely unrelated $195 billion dollar tax giveaway almost all for millionaires &amp; billionaires in the last #COVID19 relief package. Americans deserve better. Demand Answers! https://t.co/jaF1lgH8o0,2020-04-11 18:40:47,Twitter Web App,888,1456,covid; 
"Media attack President Trump over COVID-19 response" translated back into English from FOXese is: "Media accurately report Trump’s massively botched COVID-19 response." Glad to help.,2020-04-10 22:05:00,TweetDeck,455,1739,covid; 
We need science to tell us how #COVID19 spreads who is most at risk how to protect ourselves and ultimately how to eradicate it. That requires the White House and Congress to actually… consult scientists. https://t.co/oJsy46aIcs,2020-04-10 21:21:24,Twitter Web App,127,344,covid; 
CARES fund to ordinary American: $1200  People bragging after sneaking this giveaway into the bill: 0  Relationship to #COVID: 0  Consistency with Republican priorities: 100%,2020-04-09 22:30:26,Twitter Web App,102,200,covid; 
So here are the stats:  Total tax giveaway: $195 billion  Percent going to millionaire incomes &amp; above: 82%  Ratio to #COVID grant money for hospitals: nearly twice as much  Benefit per millionaire (average):  $1600000 https://t.co/qKQvuIHezh,2020-04-09 22:27:34,Twitter Web App,325,342,covid;

Next time Republicans complain about extraneous stuff in #COVID bills remember this: someone stuck a $170 BILLION tax giveaway "an easy-to-overlook provision" into our CARES bill.   https://t.co/q8fDuLLTeY,2020-04-06 21:15:00,TweetDeck,506,807,covid;

Spoke with @RISEIUcouncil frontline health care professionals today. They risk their health every day they go work.

.@realDonaldTrump could open up enrollment for the national exchange. Instead he’s trying to tear down the #ACA and preexisting conditions protections for millions of Americans – as coronavirus spreads. https://t.co/4oTCH2V723,2020-03-27 22:29:47,Twitter Web App,48,90,corona;

Can’t make this up: @USChamber is backing Trump’s decision not to use the Defense Protection Act to battle #COVID19. That cuts off an avenue to equipment like masks to keep health care providers safe &amp; able to treat patients.
