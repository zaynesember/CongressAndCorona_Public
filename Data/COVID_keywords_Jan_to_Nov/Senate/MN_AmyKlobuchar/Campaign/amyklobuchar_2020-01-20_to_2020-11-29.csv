As we tackle #COVID19 many Americans are stepping up to provide basic resources for those in need.  These volunteers in Baltimore are doing just that — providing child care &amp; making grocery runs.

Thanks @roseherring for making the equipment point as a spouse of a front line worker. Not getting basic gear puts workers—&amp; families—in harm’s way. It makes it harder to treat people w/#COVIDー19.

We must get tests to people so they know if they're sick or not.  I’m proud to work with Sen. @TinaSmithMN to expand free tests to Americans on private or public insurance to confirm if they have #COVID19.  That's why we are in Washington -- to get things done.,2020-03-21 01:09:45,Twitter for iPhone,381,2453,covid;

I’m leading legislation with Sen @Bob_Casey to help senior living facilities enhance telehealth services &amp; increase tech access so seniors can have virtual visits.

My number one concern is making sure Americans have access to #COVID_19 testing.   People need to know if they have the disease and officials need to know where and how it’s spreading.  This is why we need to get more tests approved for use as soon as possible. https://t.co/p6BCeVURyB,2020-03-16 19:10:31,Twitter Media Studio,281,1135,covid; 
Coronavirus is causing schools to shut down &amp; shift to online learning.   Low-income &amp; rural students face a major challenge in this crisis: lack of broadband access.
