Great to see our next Vice President @KamalaHarris visit Las Vegas and spend time hearing from Latino leaders!   Our Latino community has been hit disproportionately hard by #COVID19 and we need to work together to build back better.  https://t.co/grVPNQPcvo,2020-09-16 16:25:08,Twitter for iPhone,20,81,covid; 
The President knew how deadly COVID-19 was back in February and yet played down the threat.   Since then we’ve lost almost 200000 Americans to this cruel virus: mothers fathers brothers sisters friends.   The President endangered the American people and we deserve better. https://t.co/OXrjmQ6CMc,2020-09-09 19:56:54,Twitter for iPhone,14,45,covid; 
Together with Nevada’s women leaders I’m calling out President Trump for his efforts to strike down the ACA mishandling #COVID19 and handing out corporate tax breaks.   He's failed America's women and we deserve better leadership.   That leader is @JoeBiden. https://t.co/xaiAa97CYz,2020-08-27 23:25:21,Twitter for iPhone,28,103,covid; 
We're facing a lot of challenges as a nation from the #COVID19 pandemic to the fight for racial justice.  Instead of offering positive solutions all we've heard at the RNC convention this week has been division &amp; extreme partisanship.  We have to elect @JoeBiden &amp; @KamalaHarris,2020-08-26 03:13:44,Twitter for iPhone,15,47,covid; 
#COVID19 isn’t a partisan issue.  Thank you @DeanHeller Governor Sandoval and @Hutch4Nevada for reminding Nevadans of these simple important steps we must take to overcome this pandemic.  https://t.co/KuXaXWsRoe,2020-07-04 01:36:48,Twitter for iPhone,12,41,covid; 
I’m honored to serve alongside @CatherineforNV.  She is a force who has made fighting for Nevada her life’s work.   I’m proud to be her partner in the Senate as we fight for Nevada’s hardworking families to overcome #COVID19 and beyond.,2020-05-29 00:42:42,Twitter for iPhone,25,153,covid;
