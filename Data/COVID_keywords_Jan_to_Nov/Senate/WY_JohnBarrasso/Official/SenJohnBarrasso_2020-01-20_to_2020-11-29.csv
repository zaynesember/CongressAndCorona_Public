People are facing challenges all across the country. I sat down with @ShannonBream tonight to discuss how Congress is working to provide immediate relief for American workers and families as we combat the #coronavirus. https://t.co/2yt2CekSOZ,2020-03-17 03:43:33,Twitter Media Studio,4086,15449,corona; 
Congress is trying to pass targeted timely &amp; focused legislation to minimize the impact of the #coronavirus on the people who need help the most. We are especially trying to do this without putting an extra burden on small businesses. https://t.co/bAe1a6V5Kl,2020-03-16 21:12:58,Twitter Media Studio,40,177,corona;

Joined @SandraSmithFox on @FoxNews this morning to respond to @realDonaldTrump’s oval office address regarding #coronavirus and the steps we’re taking to protect Americans. https://t.co/pKCIs6kAfl,2020-03-12 16:36:22,Twitter Media Studio,21,103,corona; 
#Coronavirus emergency funding provides a surge of more than $8 bil. in resources to combat the virus. That is what experts have told us they need for research efforts vaccine development &amp; treatment. It also includes millions of dollars for response &amp; prevention efforts in WY. https://t.co/vATLPwJqeH,2020-03-05 20:07:40,Twitter Web App,23,80,corona; 
The U.S. is doing everything possible to combat and contain the #coronavirus. @realDonaldTrump and his administration are fully engaged in responding to this virus. https://t.co/2nWTZ7DM3F,2020-03-03 22:28:04,Twitter Media Studio,45,172,corona; 
#Coronavirus could turn on us quickly so we have to be vigilant. We are doing everything we need to make sure our hospitals are fully prepared. https://t.co/LjCeYsb3E7,2020-02-27 16:16:41,Twitter Media Studio,98,355,corona; 
The U.S. is prepared to deal with #coronavirus. Initial funding to @CDCgov was a good start but more is needed for testing treatment &amp; vaccine development. https://t.co/LUHhX1V5iJ,2020-02-25 17:05:32,Twitter Media Studio,11,41,corona;
