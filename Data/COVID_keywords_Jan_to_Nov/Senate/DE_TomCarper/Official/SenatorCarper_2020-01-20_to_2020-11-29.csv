That's why the new #COVID19 relief package provides those on the frontlines in Delaware and across the country with personal protective equipment that is in short supply. https://t.co/pVDOF5x7UA,2020-03-26 03:51:56,Twitter Web App,2,8,covid; 
I am proud to report that the new #COVID19 relief package includes things I fought for with @ChrisCoons and @RepLBR that will ensure Delaware has the resources it needs to stop the spread of the virus protect public health and support our small businesses that are hurting.,2020-03-26 03:51:55,Twitter Web App,10,46,covid; 
Thanks to good-faith bipartisan work over the past few days the Coronavirus Aid Relief and Economic Security Act now includes more relief for the workers and families in Delaware and across the country who need it most.,2020-03-26 03:51:55,Twitter Web App,2,6,corona;

My colleagues and I are heeding the advice of Mark McClellan and @ScottGottliebMD and calling on the Trump Administration to establish @US_FDA #COVID19 task forces to ensure availability of medical supplies and to accelerate diagnostics treatments and vaccines. https://t.co/KfThIT4Zpy,2020-03-24 18:36:43,Twitter Web App,8,25,covid; 
More than half of our nation's counties have 0 intensive care beds.  It's past time for the President to use his full authorities under the Defense Production Act now to address medical supply shortages like this so that those on the frontlines can effectively respond to #COVID19 https://t.co/s2UHm1pvew,2020-03-23 22:22:09,Twitter for iPhone,10,21,covid; 
As we work on a third #COVID19 package we can’t move away from the good bipartisan work that resulted in the first two. I’m glad to see @ChuckSchumer working across the aisle to ensure this bill includes relief for Americans who need it most. https://t.co/vsl9gWvYlq,2020-03-23 17:26:21,Twitter Web App,10,24,covid; 
These are just a few reasons why I voted against the Republicans' #COVID19 bill   I stand ready to address problems that remain so that we can quickly vote on a bill to provide real relief to states those on the front lines and Americans who need it most   Let's get this right. https://t.co/vpiQclC1mf,2020-03-23 15:21:39,Twitter Web App,192,623,covid; 
As I continue to work tonight toward a bipartisan compromise on a third #COVID19 relief package that helps all Delawareans we can all do our part to #FlattentheCurve and keep each other safe. Governor Carney’s executive order will help us do that. https://t.co/J7AihEBOrB,2020-03-23 01:18:14,Twitter for iPhone,17,63,covid; 
We need to act with the urgency that the #COVID19 crisis demands but we cannot rush through a partisan proposal that does not do enough to help hard-working Americans.,2020-03-23 00:11:06,Twitter Web App,17,62,covid; 
The challenge we are facing calls for the kind of leadership and courage Caesar Rodney and many others displayed 244 years ago. It is something that I will remind my colleagues today as we work on a third #COVID19 relief package.   We must lead with courage and deliver results.,2020-03-22 20:32:34,Twitter Web App,6,13,covid; 
For 57 years people have been gathering in Rodney Square -- under the shadow of his statue -- to participate in the oldest half marathon in America. Today’s half marathon which would have been my 37th race was cancelled because of a new battle our nation is facing: #COVID19 https://t.co/UPWrEQH3mZ,2020-03-22 20:32:32,Twitter Web App,1,5,covid; 
We were able to move quickly and pass the first two #coronavirus packages because we worked in a bipartisan way and with our nation’s governors.   We want to pass this package expeditiously too. But we can’t play politics and we can’t forget those who need our help the most,2020-03-22 19:20:28,Twitter for iPhone,11,37,corona; 
An interesting perspective and good advice from @StationCDRKelly for Americans isolating as part of our nation's response to #COVID19.

It's not enough to tell the American people that the President's authorities under DPA have been invoked.   As a recovering governor I know how important it is to get resources to states during a crisis. Without federal leadership states can't effectively contain #COVID19.,2020-03-21 16:45:13,Twitter Web App,1,2,covid; 
NEWS: I'm urging President Trump to do more than just claim invocation of the Defense Production Act.   I'm asking for a comprehensive plan on how he will address the shortage of supplies needed to respond to #COVID19 and direct military assistance to get states what they need.,2020-03-21 16:45:13,Twitter Web App,10,38,covid; 
If this is true Mr. President what specific companies have you enlisted to help produce critical life-saving equipment that our nation needs right now? And when did you speak with these businesses? If we don’t address these shortages we will see new #COVID19 cases and deaths.,2020-03-21 01:06:00,Twitter for iPhone,16,34,covid; 
.@realDonaldTrump said again that he has invoked the Defense Protection Act but Americans have yet to hear how it is being used to address the extreme medical supply shortage the men and women who are on the frontlines of #COVID19 are faced with.,2020-03-21 01:05:35,Twitter for iPhone,14,52,covid; 
We are facing an unprecedented public health crisis that has been met with an entirely inadequate response from the Trump Administration. Asking our nation’s health care workers to treat #COVID19 patients without even basic protective gear is absolutely unacceptable,2020-03-20 16:33:05,Twitter Web App,2,3,covid; 
In short #DPA allows the federal government during extreme situations to direct private companies to meet the needs of our national defense. Today that would mean boosting the production of supplies that our health care workers desperately need during the #COVID19 outbreak,2020-03-20 16:33:04,Twitter Web App,3,4,covid; 
There isn’t enough protective gear for medical professionals working around the clock to protect our families — a devastating result of @realDonaldTrump’s flat-footed response to #COVID19.  I’m continuing to push this administration to ensure medical workers have what they need. https://t.co/pMobBnrfzf,2020-03-20 01:15:34,Twitter for iPhone,33,87,covid; 
The #FamiliesFirst Act ensures:   🏥Free #COVID19 testing for all Americans.  💵 Paid leave is available for many hardworking families.  🍎🥕🥦 Nutrition assistance programs are accessible to our seniors and students.

The #FamiliesFirst Coronavirus Response Act which the Senate just passed will provide those on the front lines of this public health crisis with more resources to fight #COVID19   But I want to be very clear: this is not the last step we should take to effectively respond to it,2020-03-18 20:16:47,Twitter Web App,37,101,covid; corona; 
Republicans had no problem increasing the deficit by $1.5 trillion when it came to the #TrumpTax corporate giveaway. But suddenly they’re concerned with “wasteful spending” when it comes to helping states and hard-working families in the middle of the #COVID19 outbreak? https://t.co/DUFvwJ3vVk,2020-03-18 18:33:18,Twitter for iPhone,39,59,covid;

When health professionals say combating #COVID19 is an "all-hands-on-deck effort” they don't just mean the federal government and hospitals.

Let's get this straight: the Trump Administration cuts funding for agencies in charge of dealing with the coronavirus outbreak AND eliminates the office the Obama Administration established to better respond to health threats like this but blames President Obama.

It's imperative that the federal government adopt an all-hands-on-deck approach to tackle the #CoronarivusOutbreak.
