The President has said the coronavirus will go away and that his White House’s response has been perfect. His team told people to turn off their TVs to avoid the news. We need serious leadership not denial and downplaying. https://t.co/FapiitMJXw,2020-03-11 00:25:01,Sprout Social,6,30,corona; 
Like many people in Washington state I am frustrated by the Trump Administration’s failure to respond quickly and effectively to the coronavirus threat and ensure that testing is available to those who need it. I’ll keep demanding answers. https://t.co/hwLq6s0LkW,2020-03-09 22:36:00,Sprout Social,7,30,corona; 
This week I introduced legislation in the Senate that would require employers to provide 14 days of paid sick leave during public health emergencies like the coronavirus outbreak. https://t.co/JIRzrEayvj,2020-03-09 01:45:00,Sprout Social,16,57,corona; 
I am pushing hard for answers from the Trump Administration about the slow response to coronavirus and misinformation about testing resources and more. People in Washington state and across the country need accurate timely information. https://t.co/MH39DNHPIG,2020-03-07 17:30:05,Sprout Social,8,25,corona; 
I am doing everything I can to respond to the coronavirus threat keep families and communities safe and make sure people are getting accurate information to make the best choices for themselves and their communities. https://t.co/hwLq6s0LkW,2020-03-07 02:34:00,Sprout Social,7,29,corona; 
The Senate should immediately pass the bipartisan emergency funding for the coronavirus — state and local health officials responding to the outbreak have waited long enough for essential support and resources. https://t.co/R3LNZxiIBz,2020-03-05 03:29:00,Sprout Social,2,12,corona; 
Most workers can’t afford to stay home from work for one day or more because they feel sick which is what the CDC is recommending in the wake of the coronavirus. We need to make sure workers have the support and protection they need to help ensure our public health. https://t.co/xOfdtl1SsG,2020-03-04 01:31:18,Twitter Web App,12,33,corona; 
I know there are lots of questions about coronavirus and how to protect yourself and others in the face of this very serious public health threat.

As we prepare for a potential outbreak of coronavirus we need real leadership now more than ever. Unfortunately President Trump and his Administration don’t have the credibility to guide us through this crisis. https://t.co/1UKdpDipEP,2020-02-28 02:32:00,Sprout Social,14,37,corona; 
Not only does Vice President Pence lack qualifications and a medical background he ignored health experts in Indiana during an HIV outbreak &amp; made the situation worse. This is the person President Trump has tasked with protecting us from coronavirus? https://t.co/1UKdpDipEP,2020-02-27 19:33:17,Sprout Social,27,73,corona; 
The Trump Administration’s response to coronavirus has been absolutely inadequate. I’ll keep pushing to ensure our government is prepared for this crisis. https://t.co/boaLBsRZEG,2020-02-26 21:22:01,Sprout Social,7,24,corona;
