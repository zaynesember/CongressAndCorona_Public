Please take every precaution you can to avoid getting #COVID19. Our healthcare system is already overwhelmed and actions like wearing a mask and social distancing will make a huge difference. https://t.co/2zXXjQHy3Q,2020-11-24 20:54:33,Twitter Web App,10,32,covid; 
The burden of the #COVID19 pandemic is falling disproportionately on working moms. We need @JoeBiden in the White House to help us get through this crisis &amp; enact policies--like paid family+sick leave &amp; expanded childcare access--to help working families. https://t.co/0VW6cDH1bc,2020-11-02 20:47:20,Twitter Web App,14,87,covid; 
It's bad enough that @realDonaldTrump refuses to take any responsibility for his negligent COVID response but trying to blame the WH outbreak on Gold Star families—who have already sacrificed far more for this country than he ever will—is beyond the pale. https://t.co/xqyYXldqkE,2020-10-08 16:37:29,Twitter Web App,53,148,covid; 
Millions of American families are struggling because Trump mismanaged #COVID19 from the start.  Now he's tanking COVID relief talks and sinking our economy further even though HALF the jobs we lost on his watch haven't returned.  We can't afford 4 more years. Vote for @JoeBiden.,2020-10-06 19:55:11,Twitter Web App,37,127,covid; 
Joe Biden has a plan to help this nation recover from the pandemic protect the Affordable Care Act and build back better. Donald Trump has a plan to lie interrupt and let Americans die from #COVID19 while arguing in court to rip healthcare from millions.,2020-09-30 02:40:28,Twitter Web App,21,130,covid; 
My family fought for our nation's independence alongside George Washington &amp; I'm a proud member of @TodaysDAR. @realdonaldtrump: focus on ending #COVID19 &amp; standing up to Putin instead of wasting time trying to distract people from your failures. https://t.co/9NIOORbkoq,2020-07-07 20:12:08,Twitter Web App,979,2870,covid; 
More Americans are dying every day from #COVID19 but Donald Trump's plan is to just hope it goes away. We desperately need @JoeBiden's leadership in the Oval Office and the stakes of this election have never been clearer. https://t.co/XK1ENTe5w2,2020-07-02 18:05:50,Twitter Web App,26,66,covid; 
Sending our frontline workers into the fight against #COVID19 w/o PPE is like sending troops into battle w/o ammo or combat armor.  @JoeBiden is right: Trump has surrendered leaving the American people to fight alone. https://t.co/bapyzsPQ0V,2020-06-30 22:38:41,Twitter Web App,20,61,covid; 
Trump wants to pretend that the COVID-19 pandemic is over (it's very much not) and wants SCOTUS to take away protections for people with pre-existing conditions from the ACA.  We must elect Joe Biden this November. https://t.co/RXABV3PV4M,2020-06-26 16:23:29,Twitter Web App,24,59,covid; 
Trump is delusional for thinking that COVID-19 will just disappear and hypocritical for still refusing to wear a mask even as his administration demands that everyone else does.  Thanks @theview for having me on the show today. https://t.co/lQNXbC8dqD,2020-05-12 22:02:57,Twitter Web App,24,67,covid; 
Thank you to hotels across our state that are housing the homeless during this pandemic helping curb the spread of #COVID19 among some of the most vulnerable Illinoisans. https://t.co/4mcIULvzYM,2020-04-27 15:51:19,Twitter Web App,2,15,covid;

Let’s get something straight: Trump might not be to blame for #COVID19 but his bad decisions *are* to blame for why things got so bad here—&amp;why more Americans will die than might have otherwise. “I don’t take responsibility at all” might be the most truthful thing he’s ever said,2020-04-15 16:22:11,Twitter Web App,10,22,covid; 
If Donald Trump doesn't take immediate sweeping action against #COVID19 many more Americans could die in a pandemic that’s been made worse by a president who has refused to take measures that could be done with the stroke of a pen.

Only we the people can #FlattenTheCurve and make sure our country doesn’t have to experience quite the same kind of hell our friends across the globe are going through with #COVID19.  Please do your part.  https://t.co/qOB5psvhPW,2020-03-27 13:28:52,Twitter Web App,19,42,covid; 
I've sent a letter asking Trump to transition all activated National Guard troops across all states/territories to Title 32 authority and make sure the Federal Government covers 100% of the costs so we can better respond to #COVID19 (1/2),2020-03-25 18:47:05,Twitter Web App,20,58,covid; 
Beyond #COVID19 Asian-Americans are now fearful for their physical safety because the president has emboldened hateful people with his rhetoric. Both now and in the upcoming election let’s support our neighbors instead of letting this hate continue. https://t.co/bqhnCMb6PE,2020-03-23 18:13:39,Twitter Web App,9,15,covid; 
We are in the middle of a global pandemic and 1000s of Americans are getting infected with COVID-19 every day. What is Trump’s response? To stoke hatred and violence against Asian-Americans. This rhetoric is not only offensive it’s dangerous. (1/2) https://t.co/aVdZjXufrZ,2020-03-20 17:48:03,Twitter Web App,13,35,covid; 
We must pass legislation to expand free #COVID19 testing to all regardless of insurance coverage. This is a critically important measure to help control this pandemic. We cannot stop the spread if people can’t pay for testing and care. https://t.co/bG9tcMuvHd,2020-03-16 20:31:54,Twitter Web App,14,32,covid; 
And lastly a reminder that the #Coronavirus &amp; #COVID19 have nothing to do with race or nationality. Racism is always inexcusable and avoiding certain people or places because of racism will not help keep you or anyone else safer. (6/6),2020-03-13 13:11:41,Twitter Web App,2,12,covid; corona;
