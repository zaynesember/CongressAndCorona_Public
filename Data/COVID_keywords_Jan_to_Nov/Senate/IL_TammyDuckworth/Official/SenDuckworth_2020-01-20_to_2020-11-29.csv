With over 180000 Americans lost to #COVID19 it's clear we need more testing—not less.

So we're all on the same page Donald Trump:   ➡️Thinks "it is what it is" when 1000 Americans die from COVID-19 each day.  ➡️Confessed he's trying to suppress mail-in voting.  ➡️Hasn't stood up to Putin for reported bounties on our troops in 55 days.

It wasn't a joke.  Trump won't deny that he asked to slow down testing because he thinks the problem w/#COVID19 is how bad the numbers look NOT how many people die.

With Asians experiencing increased racism b/c of #COVID19 it’s simply irresponsible&amp;wrong for Trump to stoke fear by calling it the “Chinese Virus.” Pandemics don’t care about race ethnicity or anything else.

This bill will push the Trump Admin to improve its inadequate &amp; counterproductive efforts to protect Americans from #COVID19. It will refocus our response to where it should have been from the beginning: testing. The Senate should pass it immediately. https://t.co/Fo47LMV3yx,2020-03-16 15:18:21,Twitter Web App,33,120,covid;

#COVID19 is also a glaring reminder of why Congress must pass the FAMILY Act to prevent workers from having to choose between a paycheck and staying home when they (or a family member) are sick – it’s especially critical when staying home protects everyone.,2020-03-11 01:35:29,Twitter for iPhone,66,300,covid; 
Let’s be clear again: #COVID19 has nothing to do with race or nationality. Xenophobia and racism won’t keep people safe.  To keep Americans safe we need affordable tests for everyone who needs them.

While the risks of #COVID19 to Americans remains low we should be glad that—in the absence of effective leadership from the Trump Admin—Congress stepped up&amp;proposed bipartisan funding that recognizes just how severe this public health crisis could become if we don’t act quickly. https://t.co/FBWRmo3oCt,2020-03-04 22:34:38,Twitter Web App,42,205,covid;

#COVID19 is also a stark reminder why Congress must pass the FAMILY Act.

Medical staff are on the frontlines of viral outbreaks and put themselves at increased risk of infection.
