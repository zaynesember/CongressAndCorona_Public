ICYMI 🔔:  Esta semana platiqué con @Telemundo31 sobre la importancia de mantenerse seguro y seguir las guías de COVID-19 mientras disfrutamos de este Día de Acción de Gracias con nuestros seres queridos.  Puedes ver parte de la entrevista aquí ⬇️ https://t.co/5pxfWlQntS,2020-11-25 23:05:00,Twitter Web App,19,58,covid; 
🚨Looking forward to joining @newsmax shortly at 1PM to discuss the latest on the elections and the ongoing fight against COVID-19.  Watch here ⬇️ https://t.co/T2DTci9qmw,2020-11-25 17:51:44,Twitter for iPhone,27,117,covid; 
After several negative tests I learned I was positive for COVID-19 this AM. I’m feeling good &amp; experiencing very mild symptoms. I’ll be working from home until it’s safe for me to return to DC. I remind everyone to be careful &amp; do the right things to protect yourselves &amp; others.,2020-11-20 14:21:23,Twitter for iPhone,1752,9852,covid; 
.@NYGovCuomo is getting a pay raise while millions are suffering! For what? It’s unclear.    His COVID-19 response was a disaster. He can’t manage his state’s budget. And he expects the federal government to bail him out.    Shameful. https://t.co/hT1XB9xo8O,2020-11-18 17:01:18,Twitter Web App,293,780,covid; 
Ann and I send our thoughts and prayers to my colleague and friend @ChuckGrassley as he recovers from Coronavirus.  We hope to see you back in DC very soon! https://t.co/oIgB1Iz1CN,2020-11-17 23:10:28,Twitter for iPhone,46,299,corona; 
🚨Tune in to @varneyco at 10:15!  I’m discussing the ongoing fight against COVID-19 &amp; my request for NBC to provide info on their plans to cover the ‘22 Olympics if they take place in Beijing &amp; Communist China still refuses to respect the human rights of #Uyghurs &amp; Hong Kongers. https://t.co/RaOtN6PMdN,2020-11-17 15:00:16,Twitter for iPhone,210,271,covid; 
This is another important step in combatting COVID-19.   Thanks to the hard work of the Administration and their partnerships with the private sector we are making good progress to get a vaccine across the finish line as quickly and safely as possible. https://t.co/3vDBblqEMr,2020-11-16 14:29:23,Twitter for iPhone,63,294,covid; 
After arriving in Florida last night I came into contact with someone who subsequently tested positive for COVID.  I was tested this morning and the result was negative. I have no symptoms but out of an abundance of caution I will be immediately quarantining.,2020-11-14 17:38:37,Twitter for iPhone,139,1178,covid; 
Testing is key!  Americans deserve transparency and access to testing and I hope to hear back from @HHSGov and Governors regarding the status of the COVID tests provided by the federal government. https://t.co/EHxfKyQNu4,2020-11-13 18:30:18,Twitter for iPhone,25,146,covid; 
Today I wrote to @SecAzar &amp; all 50 Governors requesting an update on cost efficient &amp; widely-available rapid COVID tests.  Testing is key to reopening our country &amp; ending the pandemic. We must do all we can to provide accessible tests for Americans. https://t.co/GdoffBxy8u,2020-11-12 23:33:21,Twitter for iPhone,34,225,covid; 
If the @WHO was actually interested in stopping the spread of COVID-19 rather than covering up Communist China’s failures they would consider hearing from those that have succeeded.  It’s time to let #Taiwan into the WHO. https://t.co/zjg3rpzJfT,2020-11-12 17:05:20,Twitter for iPhone,790,1162,covid; 
This is everything the American people hate about politics. @NYGovCuomo is upset we’re making progress on a COVID vaccine under @realDonaldTrump.  The goal should be to develop a vaccine as quickly as possible &amp; get it distributed to as many people as possible. Period. Full stop. https://t.co/Q7vUgN6JLV,2020-11-09 16:06:38,Twitter for iPhone,318,948,covid; 
Great news! The fight against #Coronavirus continues and I’m thankful that @realDonaldTrump @SteveFDA and our private-sector partners have been so dedicated and committed to vaccine research.   A successful #vaccine is the most important step we can take to solve this crisis. https://t.co/5fPPuWKZK1,2020-11-09 14:02:11,Twitter for iPhone,216,706,corona; 
Communist China can’t spin their utter failure to control the Coronavirus.   The global community knows what really happened. Communist China lied to the world about the early spread of #Coronavirus and caused a devastating pandemic. https://t.co/Jv70V3IoLt,2020-11-07 23:53:02,Twitter for iPhone,939,1478,corona; 
While the @WHO and Communist China were lying about the #Coronavirus #Taiwan was one of the few nations that had great success in responding to the virus.  Inviting Taiwan in would be the right step and an asset to the organization. https://t.co/9B99lyp6Ye,2020-11-06 19:24:53,Twitter for iPhone,105,323,corona; 
1st mistake by the @WHO was allowing China to take charge of the investigation.  2nd was believing their findings.  Communist China lied &amp; kept the truth about the #Coronavirus from the global community &amp; the WHO helped them. That’s why I’ve led the charge to investigate the WHO. https://t.co/CAqGUlZ5ne,2020-11-03 19:42:07,Twitter for iPhone,775,1142,corona; 
Last week @SenMcSallyAZ @SenJoniErnst @SenKevinCramer @SenSasse @SenatorLankford @sendavidperdue @SenThomTillis &amp; I wrote to @HHSGov Secretary Azar requesting clarification of its guidance to ensure that those who need a COVID test can get one without out-of-pocket costs. https://t.co/G63Od0WhkE,2020-11-02 17:13:13,Twitter Web App,103,290,covid; 
After months of staying inside due to the #Coronavirus who wouldn’t want a little extra sunshine.  I’m proud to join @marcorubio on a bill to allow Floridians and visitors to enjoy our beautiful state even later in the day. https://t.co/HrBI4P8k8a,2020-10-26 17:50:15,Twitter for iPhone,118,498,corona; 
🚨LIVE TV ALERT!  Looking forward to joining @Varneyco on @FoxBusiness today at 11:15AM to discuss the importance of this election and the ongoing fight against the #Coronavirus.,2020-10-26 14:56:43,Twitter for iPhone,33,110,corona; 
🚨Coming up in the 2 o’clock hour!  I’ll be joining @toddstarnes at 2PM &amp; @cvpayne at 2:45PM to discuss the @SenateDems’ latest temper tantrum.   Between boycotting the Judiciary Committee &amp; blocking COVID relief yesterday it’s hard to tell what they’re doing up here.,2020-10-22 17:40:53,Twitter for iPhone,34,117,covid; 
.@SenateDems literally blocked a COVID relief bill less than 2 hours ago that would have helped workers and small businesses improved testing and helped schools stay safe.   Americans ARE sick and tired of these political games. So stop playing them @SenSchumer. https://t.co/EEUsXrB0U2,2020-10-21 19:39:44,Twitter for iPhone,1038,1946,covid; 
📻 Looking forward to joining @guypbenson shortly on #FoxNewsRadio.   I’ll be discussing the latest on Judge Amy Coney Barrett’s confirmation and the latest COVID relief negotiations. https://t.co/g2V0bIk6Mq,2020-10-20 19:12:59,Twitter for iPhone,27,76,covid; 
.@SenSchumer &amp; @SpeakerPelosi have made it very clear they only care about winning elections not helping Americans in need.   I won't support a bill that uses Florida taxpayer $$ to bail out poorly-managed states &amp; on liberal priorities that have nothing to do with COVID. https://t.co/SehFKQQtP9,2020-10-20 17:02:11,Twitter Web App,161,460,covid; 
Another reminder that Communist China and the @WHO hid the early spread of #coronavirus.   This has led to a devastating pandemic. They can’t be trusted and they must be held accountable. https://t.co/H8UfxVeedp,2020-10-16 00:23:16,Twitter for iPhone,1045,1171,corona; 
I misspoke this morning in my @FoxNews interview. I was tested yesterday for COVID and tested NEGATIVE.,2020-10-03 14:56:29,Twitter for iPhone,2186,9741,covid; 
Out of an abundance of caution I got a COVID test today and the results came back negative.   Continuing to keep @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS @SenMikeLee and others in my prayers.,2020-10-02 19:15:46,Twitter for iPhone,295,1540,covid; 
I won't allow Florida taxpayers to be held responsible for bailing out states that refuse to live within their means or want to spend #Coronavirus funds on unrelated liberal priorities.  Read my Op-Ed with Daniel Garza in the @orlandosentinel. https://t.co/EiqAEegwjI,2020-09-30 14:09:05,Twitter Web App,95,374,corona; 
I’ve warned about this for months &amp; now we have the evidence. Liberal states are using CARES Act funding meant for Coronavirus to fund their liberal programs.  And the Democrats are still claiming they need more taxpayer-funded bailouts. I won’t allow it. https://t.co/Ra8dTxyv6M,2020-09-22 12:53:36,Twitter Web App,203,394,corona; 
I’ve been saying this for months now.  Communist China covered up and lied about coronavirus and the @WHO helped them leading to a devastating global pandemic. It’s time for accountability. https://t.co/gwSX22r1cw,2020-09-21 23:42:33,Twitter for iPhone,906,1301,corona; 
After months of staying inside during the #coronavirus pandemic families across the nation could use a little more sunshine☀️.  I’m glad to join @marcorubio on a bill to keep the US on #DaylightSaving similar to legislation I signed during my time as Governor. #LocktheClock https://t.co/VmRsUC46J9,2020-09-16 17:35:45,Twitter for iPhone,57,196,corona; 
🚨LIVE ALERT!  Joining @kilmeade on @foxnewsradio at 11:20AM to discuss the latest on coronavirus &amp; the importance of supporting our law enforcement.   🌀At 11:40AM I’ll be joining Alex Wallace on the @weatherchannel to discuss Hurricane #Sally and the current situation in FL.,2020-09-16 15:06:25,Twitter for iPhone,12,40,corona; 
🚨LIVE TV ALERT!  I’ll be joining @Varneyco at 11:50AM to discuss the latest on #Coronavirus and how important the election this November will be for the future of our country. Tune in! https://t.co/nZUAP9GokH,2020-09-15 15:26:31,Twitter for iPhone,18,40,corona; 
.@SenSchumer &amp; @SpeakerPelosi are blocking relief for Americans in need because they think it will benefit them politically. Shameful.  Republicans’ COVID relief bill included targeted funding to benefit American workers &amp; small businesses while maintaining fiscal responsibility. https://t.co/OYhnIAVL8r,2020-09-11 16:39:18,Twitter Web App,164,283,covid; 
Today Senate Dems blocked consideration of Republicans’ COVID-19 relief package.  Their strategy is clear: pass nothing for political gain. They’re determined to stop any relief from moving forward. It’s shameful but what we’ve come to expect from @SenSchumer &amp; @SpeakerPelosi. https://t.co/AIknqVX2yT,2020-09-10 17:49:41,Twitter Web App,127,235,covid; 
Thank you to the Administration for continuing to take necessary measures to increase testing.  Rapid testing is one of the best ways we can help fight the #Coronavirus and stem the spread. https://t.co/ROUfoO60A1,2020-08-28 18:38:07,Twitter for iPhone,33,121,corona;

🚨LIVE TV ALERT!   Looking forward to joining @Varneyco at 11:40AM to talk about the ongoing fight against #Coronavirus this week’s Republican convention and the radical Left’s push for socialism and anarchy.,2020-08-24 15:08:45,Twitter for iPhone,17,76,corona; 
There’s no doubt the PPE shortage has been a hurdle in our fight against Coronavirus.  What we’ve learned is that the US must take steps to boost our stockpile to prevent this in the future. My American-Made Protection for Healthcare Workers &amp; First Responders Act addresses this. https://t.co/zd0YrNXgYw,2020-08-22 15:47:58,Twitter for iPhone,64,224,corona; 
Today I sent a letter to @realDonaldTrump as coronavirus relief negotiations continue urging him to reject bailouts for liberal states.  Instead of helping Americans in need Democrats are pushing to use taxpayer $$ to backfill their poorly-managed budgets and pension plans. https://t.co/Veyb35l6Nj,2020-08-14 21:48:35,Twitter for iPhone,314,757,corona; 
State &amp; local gov’ts have only spent about 25% of what they received in the CARES Act.  Yet @SpeakerPelosi &amp; @SenSchumer are holding up $ for Americans in need because they want to give their states $1 TRILLION more to spend on liberal programs unrelated to Coronavirus. Shameful. https://t.co/CA0gNsTESy,2020-08-12 14:42:50,Twitter for iPhone,114,216,corona; 
🚨Attention U.S. Service Academy Applicants🚨  Applications for the 2020-2021 cycle are open until Oct 16th and official test scores are due Nov 1st. Visit my website for more information and updates related to Coronavirus: https://t.co/HW1CMNbf7v,2020-08-09 13:44:57,Twitter Web App,45,104,corona; 
Widespread #coronavirus testing is one of the best ways we can fight this virus &amp; re-open our economy.  It's unacceptable that some health insurers are limiting or denying coverage. My Affordable Coronavirus Testing Act will ensure every American has access to affordable tests. https://t.co/PbdnBoFKjy,2020-08-08 13:54:16,Twitter Web App,54,213,corona; 
An amendment to hold Communist China accountable by making sure no taxpayer $$ spent by Congress to respond to the #coronavirus goes to entities owned or controlled by Communist China.  AND amendments to save families &amp; job creators more than $320 billion. https://t.co/gDvdC0B6t8,2020-08-07 18:12:28,Twitter for iPhone,898,957,corona; 
My Affordable Coronavirus Testing Act co-sponsored by @SenJoniErnst &amp; @SenMcSallyAZ to ensure Americans have access to affordable COVID-19 tests antibody tests are covered by insurance &amp; testing info is efficiently shared among health care providers &amp; public health officials.,2020-08-07 18:08:51,Twitter for iPhone,46,114,covid; corona; 
While Democrats continue to play politics and refuse to focus on actually helping Americans yesterday I proposed amendments to the COVID relief package to get the economy re-opened support businesses &amp; protect Americans.   These amendments include:,2020-08-07 18:07:52,Twitter for iPhone,143,321,covid; 
While Dems want to spend more than $3 TRILLION in taxpayer $ on their liberal projects the most important thing we can do is help workers &amp; small businesses &amp; open our economy.  I'm proposing amendments to the COVID-19 relief bill to protect Americans &amp; improve economic growth. https://t.co/0kEPttrmdr,2020-08-06 16:12:47,Twitter for iPhone,44,118,covid;

Gracias @AGAshleyMoody por el apoyo a nuestra legislación.

Thank you @AGAshleyMoody for your support of our bill. Cuba is participating in the human trafficking of doctors and using the #coronavirus pandemic for profit at the expense of hardworking physicians.

Ortega is taking a page from General Secretary Xi’s book by persecuting &amp; silencing doctors speaking up about #Coronavirus.  These doctors were trying to save lives &amp; are being punished.

Communist China continues to go to great lengths to cover up their failure and their lies.   #Coronavirus started in China and was allowed to spread further and faster because of China’s attempts to cover up the early spread. https://t.co/pPbhBY1Q8g,2020-07-26 13:42:59,Twitter for iPhone,1359,1841,corona;

What is unacceptable is @DrTedros and the @WHO siding with Communist China and helping them cover up the early spread of the #Coronavirus.  They chose to be puppets for Xi and the Chinese Communist Party rather than defend global public health. That’s unacceptable. https://t.co/fFJIcvBetn,2020-07-24 12:00:32,Twitter for iPhone,746,1257,corona; 
The @WHO again chooses to please its puppet masters in Communist China by promoting pro-Beijing propaganda to cover up their own lies &amp; failures.  But we know the truth. Communist China DID lie &amp; DID hide the early spread of #Coronavirus from the world - &amp; the WHO helped them. https://t.co/UCDyisWI4z,2020-07-23 00:07:11,Twitter for iPhone,194,417,corona;

Heading to the Senate floor around 2:20PM to speak about holding Communist China accountable.   For years they’ve been stealing our data &amp; technology.

Yesterday @SenRonJohnson &amp; I asked our colleagues &amp; the @NatlGovsAssoc to urge states to provide info about how they've used $$ received from the CARES Act &amp; other federal #coronavirus funds.  This is critical info as we consider additional relief funds. https://t.co/nOszp3xHRA,2020-07-22 14:37:57,Twitter Web App,10,51,corona; 
Closing China’s Consulate in Houston was the right move to protect our national security.

The human rights violators you work for are sending #Uyghurs to concentration camps destroying human rights in #HongKong &amp; “disappearing” doctors who warned about #Coronavirus.  Communist China absolutely should not host the 2022 @Olympics. The IOC should re-bid immediately. https://t.co/tkMV23ffDU,2020-07-22 12:03:05,Twitter for iPhone,405,671,corona; 
I’m very disappointed that the Republican proposal outlined today includes provisions allowing states to use Coronavirus-related $$ for unrelated purposes.

For months I’ve been warning about Communist China’s attempts to steal or sabotage American vaccine efforts &amp; today’s indictment by @TheJusticeDept demonstrates the reality of this threat.

Dr. Yan bravely fled her home country knowing her life &amp; work would be in danger because she spoke the truth.  Communist China hid the #Coronavirus from the global community allowing it to spread catastrophically.

This is the 2nd time the CCP has used one of their propaganda outlets to attack me which means we’re doing something right.   We can’t trust info from China about the #CoronaVirus.
