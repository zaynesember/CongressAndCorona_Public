The @WHO was complicit in Communist China’s cover up of the early spread of the #Coronavirus. Meanwhile @JoeBiden called @realDonaldTrump’s decision to ban travel from China “xenophobic.”   Biden is soft on China and wants to give taxpayer $$ to organizations they control. https://t.co/NUdmW0ulJn,2020-07-08 17:22:59,Twitter for iPhone,80,205,corona; 
Democrats are so desperate to blame President Trump that they’re now DEFENDING Communist China.
