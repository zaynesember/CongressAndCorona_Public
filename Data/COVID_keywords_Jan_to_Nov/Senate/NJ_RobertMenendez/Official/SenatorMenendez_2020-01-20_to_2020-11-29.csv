The #COVID19 pandemic has dramatically disrupted higher education.  Virtually met with leaders from NJ's colleges &amp; universities today to discuss our response to this crisis including the $14 billion we won to help them adapt to new circumstances &amp; help struggling students. https://t.co/yTBClxWs6L,2020-04-24 18:35:24,Twitter Web App,6,13,covid; 
Started off my Friday by talking to @AACCNJ members about how the federal government is helping workers families &amp; minority-owned small businesses during the #COVID19 pandemic including with $370B in funds for #PPP &amp; small biz programs that the President just signed into law.,2020-04-24 17:54:53,Twitter Web App,2,9,covid; 
The @WashingtonPost Editorial Board is right. Congress must take action to help states &amp; municipalities struggling to fight #COVID19. That’s why @SenBillCassidy and I proposed a $500 billion SMART fund to help our local communities survive. https://t.co/qbopTKvTYJ,2020-04-24 15:21:29,Twitter Web App,11,26,covid; 
Proud that NJ’s own @RutgersU @RutgersBHS is leading the nation on #COVID19 research with the largest study of health care workers exposed to coronavirus in the U.S.  This research is vital to helping us battle this deadly pandemic. #JerseyStrong https://t.co/XsrwWaA4M3,2020-04-24 14:15:09,Twitter Web App,23,48,covid; corona; 
Thank you @louiscappellijr for supporting our $500 billion SMART Fund which would make sure states and localities hit hardest by #COVID19 receive the most help. https://t.co/F4aE1S3DWE,2020-04-23 21:56:13,Twitter Web App,2,11,covid; 
Our states did not choose to face the #COVID19 pandemic.   They did not choose to have this deadly virus claim thousands of American lives.  They did not choose to have their economies sink into a devastating recession. https://t.co/F07r93DyLG,2020-04-23 20:53:28,Twitter Web App,9,30,covid; 
Thank you Mayor @RasJBaraka for supporting the $500 billion SMART fund that @SenBillCassidy and I have been fighting for.  Our states and cities battling #COVID19 on the frontlines need the federal govt to step up and help as costs skyrocket and revenues dry up. https://t.co/qcAVGHMQIM,2020-04-23 18:26:01,Twitter Media Studio,3,10,covid; 
As a former mayor I understand the toll fighting #COVID19 has on cities towns &amp; states on the frontlines. Our big bold bipartisan $500 billion SMART fund will help state &amp; local govts maintain essential services as revenue dries up &amp; costs skyrocket. https://t.co/dpetKEguuO,2020-04-22 13:30:49,Twitter Web App,10,20,covid; 
Couldn't agree more. Doctors nurses respiratory therapists grocery clerks factory workers making ventilators—immigrants are fighting on the front lines against #COVID19. The President needs to understand the enemy is not immigrants but rather a virus that endangers us all. https://t.co/2OWCDUB7ee,2020-04-22 00:35:34,Twitter for iPhone,18,47,covid; 
That’s why @SenBillCassidy and I have put forward a plan to deliver $500 billion in emergency aid to states hit hardest by the coronavirus.  I'm encouraged by Pres. Trump’s stated commitment to support this effort &amp; will be working to ensure it's in the next round of stimulus $.,2020-04-21 22:06:26,Twitter Web App,2,7,corona; 
But Congress must take bolder action ASAP to help the states hit hardest by this pandemic and its economic fallout.   Republican &amp; Democratic governors alike are pleading for more help to ensure their states can fight #COVID19 while continuing to provide essential resources.,2020-04-21 22:06:26,Twitter Web App,1,7,covid; 
We also secured $100 billion to shore up our health care system’s fight against #COVID19 including $75B for providers &amp; $25B to address our national shortage in testing.  We cannot begin to get back to normal &amp; reopen our economy until testing for COVID-19 is widely available.,2020-04-21 22:06:26,Twitter Web App,1,3,covid; 
Both N.J. and La. have faced major disasters. But @SenBillCassidy and I recognize that the #COVID19 pandemic is unprecedented like a hurricane sitting on land indefinitely.   Our bipartisan $500 billion SMART fund plan answers governors’ calls for help. https://t.co/VCZbiKZJhX,2020-04-21 17:21:25,Twitter Web App,8,21,covid; 
Suspending immigration months after the #coronavirus started spreading in our communities is not a public health decision.

President Trump ended DACA b/c he refused to accept the value of #Dreamers in our communities.  Dreamers in NJ and across the country are on the frontlines tirelessly working against #COVID19.

That’s why TODAY @SenBillCassidy &amp; I proposed a bigger bolder bipartisan state stabilization plan that answers the bipartisan calls from our nation’s governors by creating a $500 billion fund to help states &amp; local govts respond to the #COVID19 crisis. https://t.co/PTlnKF5bDQ,2020-04-20 17:44:33,Twitter Web App,7,23,covid;

Trump on the #CoronavirusOutbreak: “I think that's a problem that's going to go away.”   That sure isn’t the sense of urgency we need from the U.S. President.

First things first: The risks posed by the novel #coronavirus here in our state remain low.
