The size of your pocketbook shouldn’t affect your ability to be tested for COVID-19. That’s why I’m supporting legislation to expand free testing.  https://t.co/4tAU2ayDjp,2020-03-15 14:10:03,Twitter for iPhone,13,115,covid; 
I’m introducing legislation to expand free tests to confirm coronavirus infections.   In a public health crisis like #COVID19 it’s critical to be able to identify and contain positive cases in our communities. If somebody needs to be tested they should be able to receive one.,2020-03-13 17:14:30,Twitter for iPhone,39,207,covid; corona;

Albuquerque’s TriCore Reference Laboratories is now able to perform diagnostic tests for COVID-19. This will greatly expand our state’s capacity for testing.

I’ll always fight for better family leave policies and I’m proud to join @PattyMurray and @rosadelauro to introduce legislation to provide paid sick days immediately to workers in light of the coronavirus crisis and in preparation for future public health emergencies.,2020-03-10 15:22:45,Twitter Web App,8,36,corona; 
.@CDC recommends staying home if you're sick to help prevent the spread of #COVID19.

As I continue to work with local state and federal officials to ensure our public health infrastructure in New Mexico is ready for what we may face with the coronavirus I encourage everyone to do your part to better prepare yourself and your family.  https://t.co/Pg3rTpbaz1,2020-02-27 17:23:57,Twitter Web App,13,40,corona;

Yesterday the CDC confirmed the first U.S. case of coronavirus spread from person-to-person contact.

China perpetuates the sale of wild animals like civets bats &amp; snakes in food markets. That’s what gave us SARS &amp; now this deadly coronavirus. They are putting endangered wildlife at risk of extinction &amp; they are endangering the lives of people worldwide.  https://t.co/sdAwBubIKp,2020-01-26 21:39:54,Twitter for iPhone,797,893,corona;
