Once a safe effective COVID-19 vaccine is available Hawai‘i must be prepared to successfully distribute it to families across our state.  These federal funds will ensure that we have the infrastructure in place to quickly and widely administer the vaccine https://t.co/puNwJGa9Tt,2020-10-06 21:22:16,Twitter Web App,5,22,covid; 
By expanding access to COVID-19 testing and teaching preventative practices to students in rural areas this grant will help us keep more Hawai'i families safe.  I'm proud that UH is leading this effort to bring additional resources to areas that need it most. https://t.co/DQuhx4zlTy,2020-09-30 00:03:44,Twitter Web App,0,9,covid; 
As schools prepare to reopen for in-person learning it's important that we take every precaution to prevent the spread of COVID-19.  We need proper ventilation in schools to keep students families teachers and other school workers safe. https://t.co/Dc0HBratkg,2020-09-25 00:31:53,Twitter Web App,4,14,covid; 
We’ve heard the Majority Leader say he feels “no sense of urgency” to move on COVID relief.   Yet when Justice Ginsburg tragically passes he feels a tremendous sense of urgency to fill her seat.  It's shameful that he's prioritizing this vacancy over helping the American people. https://t.co/2TduBeiT9x,2020-09-23 15:06:31,TweetDeck,245,678,covid; 
We've known all along that nursing homes were particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 so it is infuriating to see that basic infection control practices were not in place months after the pandemic began.   Avalon must take immediate action to ensure the safety of residents &amp; staff. https://t.co/X9hCSwedef,2020-09-21 19:01:57,Twitter Web App,2,11,covid; 
Hawai‘i will get $70M more in federal dollars to provide those unemployed due to COVID-19 with an additional $300/week.  While this will provide some immediate help it’s not enough for families struggling to make ends meet. We’ll continue working to secure more federal funding. https://t.co/lrzmq1OxAH,2020-09-16 21:12:37,TweetDeck,1,20,covid; 
I‘m alarmed that Avalon’s facilities are not able to adequately protect their residents and staff from COVID-19.  With outbreaks at all three of its homes in Hawaiʻi — including the veterans home in Hilo — it's clear that Avalon Health Care needs to do more to keep people safe. https://t.co/kp3wQdccio,2020-09-15 20:39:43,Twitter Web App,2,13,covid; 
UPDATE — @DeptVetAffairs will immediately send a team of infection control experts nurses and other health care professionals to help contain the COVID-19 outbreak at the Yukio Okutsu State Veterans Home in Hilo. https://t.co/SVHx6gFWON,2020-09-11 21:05:42,Twitter Web App,4,19,covid; 
Seniors deserve to retire with the dignity &amp; benefits they've earned after a lifetime of hard work.  But today 85 years after President Roosevelt signed Social Security into law Trump is raiding the trust fund instead of passing a real COVID relief bill. https://t.co/dNBce7cLIj,2020-08-14 18:45:27,Twitter Web App,95,123,covid; 
STARTING TODAY: census workers will begin going door to door across Hawaii to help families fill out the 2020 Census.  They'll have government IDs be wearing masks &amp; are trained to stay socially distant.  Here's how you can identify census workers: https://t.co/RcWBm4ICLV,2020-07-30 22:55:17,Twitter Web App,9,15,socially distant; 
We've worked so hard together to slow the spread of the coronavirus. But to get through this tough time we need everybody to do their part.  So any time you leave your home please wear a mask. https://t.co/fjuy8KLsq0,2020-07-30 19:02:35,Twitter Web App,9,28,corona;

Our frontline workers are at high risk for mental health issues because of the work they're doing to save lives and keep our country safe.   We must #FundMentalHealth in the next coronavirus relief bill.,2020-05-14 00:40:24,Twitter for iPhone,1,16,corona; 
Nonprofits are fast they are nimble and they are on the frontlines of the #COVID19 response. As we ask them to do more they are facing revenue shortfalls.  These institutions are absolutely pivotal to our survival and recovery – and they need more funding. https://t.co/vzW1mnfpD0,2020-04-30 19:15:37,Twitter Web App,18,32,covid; 
The only way we can begin to reopen our economy is by ramping up testing. This new federal funding will give us the additional resources we need to test more people and help stop the spread of COVID-19 in our state. https://t.co/Wp9igpZQuT,2020-04-24 18:33:19,TweetDeck,6,23,covid; 
UPDATE: the Senate just passed a relief bill providing $310B to help small businesses affected by COVID-19.  If you own a small businesses &amp; couldn't access the first round of funding or didn’t get your loan approved in time you now have another chance to access federal dollars. https://t.co/VdMAkRgu0z,2020-04-22 01:23:14,Twitter Web App,3,10,covid; 
For those of us in Congress it's our job to make sure that people can survive during the #coronavirus pandemic.   We still have more work to do but this $2 trillion relief bill is a good start &amp; will help people ride out this storm.  https://t.co/8l19PbO94F,2020-03-27 00:01:00,TweetDeck,27,102,corona; 
It’s vital to public health that people who feel sick can stay home without fear of going broke. We need to expand unemployment benefits to those who are unable to work due to a public health emergency.   That’s why we’re introducing the #Coronavirus Worker Relief Act. https://t.co/x6Kq0VZAN9,2020-03-12 18:04:20,Twitter Web App,8,35,corona; 
UPDATE: today Hawai‘i gained access to more than $4.5M in emergency federal funds to help our state respond to the #coronavirus.    This is a good first step and we're working on more ways to keep people safe during this outbreak.   https://t.co/1HRCdBPhBs,2020-03-11 19:35:41,Twitter Web App,1,12,corona; 
The #coronavirus emergency funding bill includes our provision to expand telehealth care in outbreak areas for those on Medicare.  This will help reduce disease spread &amp; keep our most vulnerable communities healthy. Read more ⬇️ https://t.co/2Ese1ju8SP,2020-03-09 20:42:31,Twitter Web App,5,17,corona; 
Yesterday the House and Senate approved emergency funds to help states manage the #coronavirus outbreak.  This means that Hawai‘i will receive at least $4.5M to help our state's response. https://t.co/FO3UEqen9m,2020-03-06 21:21:59,Twitter Web App,3,17,corona; 
We need to hear more about the #coronavirus from scientists &amp; public health experts — not pundits &amp; politicians.   Yesterday I asked CDC leadership about the spread of the virus &amp; urged them to hold a daily public briefing so we can get all the facts. https://t.co/GWTYvyGRVj,2020-03-05 17:36:34,Twitter Web App,55,199,corona; 
At least $4.5M is headed to Hawai‘i as part of Congress's bipartisan emergency funding bill to manage the #coronavirus outbreak.   While there are still no confirmed cases in Hawai‘i this federal money will help support our state's response efforts &amp; keep our families safe. https://t.co/fB6S98VIbk,2020-03-05 01:31:56,Twitter for iPhone,13,44,corona; 
The Trump administration's response to the #Coronavirus is unacceptable. They have communicated poorly with state officials left key positions unfilled &amp; want to cut preparedness &amp; response funding.   Today I demanded answers from Trump official @SecAzar. https://t.co/2fxcuPD3gU,2020-02-26 01:01:00,TweetDeck,5,25,corona; 
It's unacceptable that we won't have functioning test kits to detect the #Coronavirus until mid-March. Port of entry states need those kits to make sure our families are safe &amp; healthy.  Watch my exchange with @SecAzar below 📺 https://t.co/ILsj1aj8Ou,2020-02-25 23:15:00,TweetDeck,19,49,corona; 
While the Trump administration struggles to respond to the #Coronavirus outbreak and asks for emergency funding today @SecAzar is defending massive cuts to the very programs that fight infectious diseases.  This is absurd. https://t.co/0aPzAGDndi,2020-02-25 21:25:39,TweetDeck,354,605,corona; 
There are no confirmed cases of #coronavirus in Hawaiʻi but we're working hard to get new test kits from the CDC to our state as soon as possible.  📻 hear more in last week's interview with Hawai‘i Public Radio https://t.co/y8mU6P0UOr,2020-02-25 01:02:00,TweetDeck,119,187,corona; 
There should be a global health security expert on the National Security Council coordinating the response to outbreaks like the coronavirus.  But the Trump administration has left that job vacant for nearly 2 years.  They need to fill the job immediately. https://t.co/PNB580uhi3,2020-02-19 19:03:00,TweetDeck,29,84,corona; 
State &amp; local health officials are leading the effort to contain the coronavirus outbreak. They deserve to be reimbursed by the federal government for those costs.   We're working to make that process easier ⬇️  https://t.co/w24JvgGS72,2020-02-14 21:43:46,Twitter Web App,2,11,corona;
