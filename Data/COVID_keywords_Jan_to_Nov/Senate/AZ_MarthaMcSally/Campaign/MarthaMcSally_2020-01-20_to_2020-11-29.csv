I’m in DC fighting to get Judge Barrett confirmed &amp; deliver COVID relief. Thanks to some creativity &amp; my awesome team of volunteers I’m still talking to AZ voters this weekend!   Our Constitutional freedoms lower taxes safety &amp; better health care are on the ballot. Go VOTE! https://t.co/qnysc1HjnG,2020-10-24 22:48:04,Twitter for iPhone,72,279,covid; 
Thank you to my friend @VoteMarsha for joining me last night to talk about what we’re doing to hold China accountable for lying about COVID-19 and unleashing this virus on the world.   Fighting to protect Arizonans will always be my top priority. https://t.co/m4nmMtyQ3t,2020-10-22 21:34:01,Twitter for iPhone,43,115,covid; 
Democrats’ obstruction is hurting Arizonans and it’s shameful. They just voted NO on our COVID relief bill with increased funding for:   👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Families &amp; childcare   💼 Small businesses   📝 Schools   👨🏼‍🌾 Farmers &amp; Ranchers    🔬 Vaccines research &amp; distribution https://t.co/SrHsLf5qSE,2020-10-21 20:01:01,Twitter Web App,61,126,covid; 
I stood up to China and am holding them accountable for unleashing COVID on the world…Mark Kelly cozied up to them. https://t.co/XLF39PKden,2020-10-07 02:21:59,Twitter Web App,130,294,covid; 
I’m a woman we can multitask. We should be able to move forward on the Supreme Court and provide much-needed COVID relief. https://t.co/7vqEGrDgGJ,2020-09-25 21:18:13,Twitter Web App,62,150,covid; 
Arizona is ready for the Great American Comeback! Before the Coronavirus we had the best economy we have seen in my lifetime. With proven conservative leadership we will bring it back even stronger. https://t.co/gNvZH0mwAm,2020-09-17 00:15:13,Twitter Web App,43,134,corona; 
Cameron understands we must stand up to China. For too long they have been stealing our IP and taking jobs. Now they unleashed the Coronavirus on the world. If we don't stop them they will replace us on the world stage. https://t.co/TO1HPzZsf1,2020-09-05 00:34:41,Twitter Web App,47,117,corona; 
China is an adversary and has shown they will do anything to replace us on the world stage. We need leaders who are willing to stand up to them. That is why I introduced legislation to allow Arizonans to sue China over their role in the Coronavirus.  https://t.co/wOGOylEQVz,2020-08-10 20:55:41,Twitter Web App,1726,1977,corona;

After the Communist Chinese Party's #COVID19 coverup efforts and lack of action to contain the virus it’s clear we can’t rely on them. We need to cut ties and bring all of our manufacturing back home to the United States! https://t.co/DoImnf32Z2,2020-05-27 00:27:42,Twitter Media Studio,1922,2004,covid; 
America is learning that the Communist Chinese government lied &amp; continues to coverup about the Coronavirus. We will come back from this stronger than ever but the Chinese government must be held accountable and we must never again rely on them for critical supply chain needs. https://t.co/LX13VbSXEb,2020-05-15 16:00:23,Twitter Media Studio,181,356,corona; 
I will never back down to Communists. They can threaten me but the world knows the truth: China unleashed COVID19 lied about it &amp; must be held accountable. The Chinese gov't doesn’t know who they're dealing with if they think I’m going to be intimidated! https://t.co/dtWpOGVwyS,2020-05-14 19:20:41,Twitter Web App,402,1058,covid;
