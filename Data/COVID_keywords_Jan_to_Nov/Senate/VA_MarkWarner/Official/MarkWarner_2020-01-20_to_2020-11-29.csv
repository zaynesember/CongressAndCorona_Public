The President of the United States (who has voted by mail in the last three elections) personally directed the White House budget director to punish states that expand mail-in voting due to COVID.   My question: Where the heck does the budget office get that kind of authority? https://t.co/JYlLf5tcnm,2020-06-04 15:21:51,Twitter Media Studio,3245,6786,covid; 
During this moment of silence we remember the 100000+ Americans lost to COVID-19. These are not just statistics. Each represents a life taken too soon and a family torn apart. My heart is with those they leave behind.  https://t.co/RrxWOUgMI4,2020-06-01 16:01:31,Twitter Web App,84,249,covid; 
The proposal Bernie @SenDougJones @SenBlumenthal &amp; I just introduced is simple:   Rank-and-file workers who’ve lost their jobs because of the coronavirus will go back to receiving their paychecks &amp; benefits until it is safe to go back to work.   We need #PaycheckSecurity now. https://t.co/WAVCukJQuG,2020-05-21 20:40:15,Twitter for iPhone,313,1362,corona; 
This thread is worth a full read. When we talk about coronavirus we can’t separate the issue from the need to expand access to healthcare and address centuries-old racial disparities in our system. https://t.co/CDZpaP8006,2020-05-19 22:08:40,Twitter for iPhone,78,209,corona; 
Our health privacy laws are years behind the technology that we’ll need for contact tracing and other coronavirus efforts.

WOW. 27 million Americans have likely lost their health insurance because of coronavirus layoffs. That means up to 55 million Americans are without coverage in the middle of a pandemic.

This is why I’ve been pushing hard for coronavirus relief to state and local governments. The last thing we should be doing right now is laying off teachers first responders healthcare workers and other Americans who earn a living working for their local government. https://t.co/VqylGkPgVh,2020-05-12 14:07:38,Twitter Web App,83,212,corona;

We can’t just “wait and see” what happens to the millions who’ve lost their jobs and health insurance in the middle of a pandemic. They need paychecks now.

Millions are losing their jobs and healthcare due to coronavirus but it doesn’t have to be this way.

If we’re going to do coronavirus tax relief it can’t just be about shoring up companies’ bottom line. We’ve got to help workers who’ve been furloughed lost their jobs or had their hours cut.
