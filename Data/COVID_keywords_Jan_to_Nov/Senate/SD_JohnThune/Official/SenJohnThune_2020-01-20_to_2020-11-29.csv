We should be sitting down &amp; working on a reasonable targeted fiscally responsible #COVID relief bill. Republicans have been more than willing to do that. But the Democrats continue to insist upon a multi-trillion dollar bill consisting of a bunch of liberal wish list items. https://t.co/OC2EgJTkPc,2020-11-18 20:37:00,Twitter Media Studio,297,803,covid; 
Republicans aren’t giving up on targeted #COVID relief but so far Democrats have shown no willingness for compromise. I hope that changes.

Yesterday for the second Monday in a row we received tremendous news about the prospects for a COVID vaccine.

Democrats’ attempted delay antics over the last seven-plus days were absurd. After they voted to block COVID relief multiple times &amp; tried to adjourn the Senate entirely Dems suddenly brought up a completely unrealistic “relief” bill to delay the #SCOTUS vote. Pure theatrics. https://t.co/jH2PBJ1jOb,2020-10-26 21:21:13,Twitter Media Studio,221,655,covid; 
Hard to believe that Senate Democrats just voted AGAIN to block COVID relief. There are Americans who can't feed their families because of the economic side effects of COVID-19 shutdowns yet Democrats still refuse to act unless GOP allows 2.4 trillion in irresponsible spending.,2020-10-21 17:53:48,Twitter Web App,1482,2504,covid; 
Why haven't we passed more COVID relief? Let’s boil this down because it’s pretty simple. Dems are sabotaging negotiations &amp; holding relief hostage over blue-state bailouts. Pelosi's all-or-nothing negotiating tactics can't work &amp; sadly it’s Americans who'll pay the price. https://t.co/0gwARcWtBE,2020-10-20 19:40:38,Twitter Media Studio,1574,2592,covid; 
Republicans have tried for months to pass targeted support for Americans affected by COVID. We've proposed multiple relief bills but Pelosi's demand is hundreds of billions for blue state bailouts or no deal.

Nancy Pelosi is holding key COVID aid hostage unless Congress adds trillions more to the national debt.   Targeted COVID relief?  “No.” ❌ Lifeline for small businesses?  “No.” ❌ Airline employee assistance?  “No.” ❌  It’s pretty clear she’s putting politics above policy.,2020-10-08 17:16:28,Twitter for iPhone,612,1097,covid;

When Republicans saw Dems had left key ag funding out of the CR we demanded it be fixed. It's been a hard year for farmers/ranchers: low commodity prices bad weather difficulties w/ markets and – of course – #COVID.

I couldn’t agree more. @DepSecSteve is an old friend and colleague of mine and one of the best advocates for the American ag community.

Good to see this admin supporting American farmers &amp; ranchers. The @USDA announced second round of vital #CFAP $ to help producers hit hard by #COVID19.

Senate Dems recently filibustered: ❌ Relief funding for schools ❌ COVID vaccine funding ❌ Stimulus payments to Americans ❌ Police reform Now they’re saying they would eliminate the filibuster.

I hope every American understands what's been happening in Congress w/ #COVID relief funding. Republicans have been trying in earnest to pass a bill; we've offered multiple versions &amp; pursued negotiations. Dems intro’d one spending spree bill &amp; adamantly refused to compromise.,2020-09-10 19:05:45,Twitter Web App,282,450,covid; 
Let’s be clear: The Democrats’ current negotiating position is that unless Congress passes their $3 trillion #COVID spending proposal they aren't interested in a deal. That's right Dems think providing Americans with *zero* assistance is better than our targeted bill. https://t.co/C9vC3ViRqL,2020-09-09 20:57:50,Twitter Media Studio,343,569,covid;

.@SenateGOP’s latest #coronavirus relief bill is another effort by Republicans to try to find common ground on a realistic #COVID19 funding proposal. This week's vote will be an opportunity for Dems to finally take action after showing an unwillingness to negotiate for months.,2020-09-09 14:09:08,Twitter Web App,9,40,covid; corona; 
There have been two consistent themes of the #COVID19 federal response: 1. Dems’ unwillingness to negotiate on any point unless GOP agrees to add trillions to the national debt. 2. Republicans’ efforts to find common ground on a targeted and fiscally responsible COVID relief.,2020-09-08 22:35:44,Twitter Web App,228,729,covid;

Republicans want to pass a coronavirus relief bill &amp; we’re ready to negotiate. But Democrats have to want to come to the table. ‘Our way or the highway’ is not a negotiating position. I hope – I really hope – that Dems will work with us on a bill that can actually become law.,2020-08-05 21:59:55,Twitter Web App,386,1064,corona; 
Republicans have offered multiple proposals for the next step of #COVID19 relief yet each time Democrats come back with the same response: "pass the HEROES Act.” 1. This bill won't pass – it’s not targeted &amp; not fiscally responsible 2. This is not how negotiations work.,2020-08-05 20:15:48,Twitter Web App,134,315,covid; 
When Republicans announced our #COVID19 relief bill we knew our version wouldn’t be the final draft &amp; were open to negotiating. But negotiations involve compromise on both sides and Democrats apparently aren’t willing to budge one inch on their $3 trillion+ 100% partisan bill. https://t.co/V1GmjZqJCf,2020-08-05 18:15:38,Twitter Media Studio,10,44,covid; 
Let’s be clear Dems’ $3 trillion+ #COVID bill will never pass the Senate. It’s not targeted. It’s not fiscally responsible. Republicans have been trying to negotiate in good faith but Dems refuse to work w/ us to find common ground &amp; they continue to push their messaging bill.,2020-08-05 17:55:25,Twitter Web App,349,843,covid; 
There’s only one way we’re going to make progress on the next round of COVID relief: Democrats must come to the table in a serious way. @SenateGOP wants to help but piling an additional $3 TRILLION onto the national debt as Dems have suggested is a totally unserious proposal.,2020-07-30 21:40:25,Twitter Web App,141,382,covid; 
Coronavirus has turned lives upside down.

SCAM WARNING: If the @SDDOH contacts you about potential #COVID19 exposure they will NEVER ask for credit card info or money. If you are asked for this info or asked to pay anything it is a scam.

If Dems want to play a productive role in the next phase of COVID relief we have a good place to start w/ our targeted HEALS Act. The House bill which would cost $3 TRILLION+ is chock-full of liberal agenda items fiscally irresponsible &amp; will not be considered in the Senate. https://t.co/tbnn4ky357,2020-07-28 20:09:01,Twitter Media Studio,230,553,covid; 
The #HEALSAct announced by @senatemajldr is the result of months of careful evaluation of existing #COVID19 relief efforts. This new targeted relief bill will give support to Americans who truly need it. I’m hopeful we can come to an agreement that reflects these priorities.,2020-07-27 22:17:13,Twitter Web App,35,122,covid; 
Without a doubt we cannot reverse this economic downturn w/o attacking the underlying health care crisis. We must ensure medical workers have resources to treat patients develop treatments &amp; find a vaccine. This continues to be a priority in the next phase of #COVID relief.,2020-07-22 21:17:47,Twitter Web App,7,56,covid; 
I hope that my Senate Democrat colleagues will eventually look beyond their liberal wish list &amp; work with us to build a bipartisan #COVID19 relief package that addresses the real issues Americans are facing.

We’ve been closely monitoring the $2.4 trillion in relief funds that have already been allocated to fight #COVID.

A few of my priorities in this next phase of federal #COVID relief: -More relief for struggling Americans -Funding for impacted farmers &amp; ranchers -Protection from surprise state taxes for #COVID relief &amp; mobile/remote workers -Telehealth -Liability protections for schools &amp; biz,2020-07-22 14:25:04,Twitter for iPhone,4,41,covid; 
We had a good meeting with @senategop &amp; members of the president’s team where we discussed some of the broad principles of the next round of federal #COVID19 relief for the American people. We are all in agreement that this effort is about kids jobs and health care.,2020-07-21 21:25:33,Twitter for iPhone,3,13,covid; 
The #COVID19 crisis we’re facing today is different than the one we saw in March &amp; as a result so will be our response. Waiting and evaluating was the right call.

This week alone the Senate is hosting 8 committee hearings on #COVID19.

The May #JobsReport underscores @SenateGOP’s calls to look closely at already-passed #COVID19 measures before pushing out more relief $$.

Question: What’s one way the world can hold China accountable for its role in spreading the #COVID19 pandemic?   Answer: By keeping Huawei equipment out of the world’s 5G networks.   “There are no easy answers but there are simple answers.” Ronald Reagan,2020-04-18 15:22:36,Twitter for iPhone,30,107,covid; 
#China has been spreading misinformation about #COVID19 from day one. This should be a wakeup call to the world about how China operates: a complete lack of transparency and censorship of facts. This is going to take an international response to hold them accountable. https://t.co/pFvKHZKM2r,2020-04-17 16:28:02,Twitter Media Studio,931,1074,covid;
