This pandemic has forced 40% of Americans to face food insecurity. The Senate should not have left town this week knowing families will go hungry over Thanksgiving without a COVID-19 relief bill.

Corporate executives shouldn’t be able to game the system to profit off insider info like a COVID vaccine.

Trump's COVID task force admits a delayed transition threatens lives and vaccine distribution.

Yesterday the U.S. recorded 100000+ COVID-19 cases in a single day for the first time. 234000+ Americans have died.

The president got world class care at Walter Reed. That’s fine.

To sum up Trump’s position: Stop efforts to help America defeat COVID-19 in order to focus 100% on putting someone on SCOTUS to destroy the Affordable Care Act and take away health care protections from Americans.

Trump now says “I get it” and he has “learned a lot” at “the real school.” Tragically it is too late for the nearly 210000 Americans dead and more than 7.4 million infected with COVID-19.

Low wage workers are hit hardest by the COVID-19 crisis.

Facts to put the GOP's priorities in perspective:  Over 40% of COVID-19 deaths were linked to nursing homes or long-term care facilities.  Targeted funding to help nursing homes experiencing outbreaks in the GOP bill?  $0  Funding to help Trump get richer?  $1.75 billion,2020-07-29 20:34:13,Twitter Web App,211,383,covid; 
Congress spent years working towards a new FBI campus. Trump pulled the plug.

Over 130000 TPS holders work on the front lines of our country's COVID-19 response.  Trump's efforts to strip their status and deport them is unjust and stupid.

Nursing homes have been hit especially hard by COVID-19. In Maryland alone 2/3 of all long-term care facilities have COVID-19 cases. Time is of the essence.

The House has done their job by passing a second bipartisan package to provide free testing for the coronavirus establish new requirements for paid sick leave and expand food assistance. Now the Senate must do our job and pass it immediately. Still much more to do.,2020-03-14 14:56:02,Twitter for iPhone,101,377,corona; 
As we work to pass additional measures to address the public health and economic impact of the coronavirus we should listen to the experts and do what we can to help one another. I’ve put together a site to help provide such information → https://t.co/IKWiDkdLyb https://t.co/1oI5AtbUNa,2020-03-13 22:31:07,Twitter Media Studio,62,151,corona; 
Along with @SenatorCardin @MarkWarner and @TimKaine we’re urging financial regulators to use their powers to mitigate the impacts of the coronavirus on workers and those in hard-hit industries such as hospitality and tourism as more Americans practice social distancing. https://t.co/8XzFuZmGIO,2020-03-13 21:47:05,Twitter Web App,50,111,corona; 
Happy 40 years to the Black Nurses Association of Greater Washington! We must support nurses who really are the glue that binds together our health care system and who are fighting on the front lines of the coronavirus crisis to help those in need. https://t.co/D7FzaDKzKR,2020-03-13 21:26:44,Twitter Web App,14,66,corona; 
I’m glad that the President listened to our call to declare a National Emergency. By invoking the Stafford Act states will now have new resources to help with coronavirus response efforts. I urge Maryland to request these funds and the Administration to immediately approve them.,2020-03-13 21:08:18,Twitter Web App,16,78,corona; 
To help stop the spread of the coronavirus we must ensure employees aren’t going to work sick because they fear they will be penalized by their bosses if they stay home. I’m introducing a bill with @SenTinaSmith to ensure workers aren't fired or punished for being quarantined.,2020-03-13 20:33:05,Twitter Web App,39,196,corona; 
After hearing from workers that the Social Security Administration is still denying telework amidst the coronavirus outbreak I’m demanding answers from the agency and why they’re not properly informing employees about their health and safety plan. https://t.co/wOXCDKyjRa,2020-03-13 16:29:17,Twitter Web App,76,185,corona; 
After leaving the briefing on the coronavirus and hearing the President’s misdirected speech last night we urgently need to pass the House legislation to further bolster the response and support those who may be out of work because of the crisis. Together let’s get this done.,2020-03-12 15:33:07,Twitter Web App,29,139,corona; 
We are dealing with a global pandemic and the Trump Administration still wants to cut billions from CDC HHS and the Infectious Diseases Rapid Response Reserve Fund. Not only does this defy logic when these agencies are fighting the coronavirus but it’s downright dangerous. https://t.co/uOikRi9bhr,2020-03-12 02:40:29,Twitter for iPhone,103,208,corona; 
With the coronavirus there’s a new urgency to tackle the digital divide. I introduced the Homework Gap Trust Fund Act to ensure that ALL students have access to the internet at home. The possibility that schools may rely on distance learning highlights the need to get this done. https://t.co/oStwrJHvzw,2020-03-11 12:29:56,Twitter Media Studio,50,184,corona; 
We must protect consumers who are in financial danger due to the coronavirus leaving them out of work. Right now 40% of American households would not be able to cover a $400 emergency expense; they'd be unable to pay their rent car payments and credit card bills. https://t.co/iNvd4BLVrY,2020-03-10 22:59:27,Twitter Media Studio,134,332,corona; 
Trump should focus on the health threats from the coronavirus and rapidly expanding the number of available testing kits rather than prioritizing help for oil and gas companies who are lobbying against paid sick leave. Listen to the health experts not self-deputized Dr. Trump. https://t.co/XXXJSkdxNV,2020-03-10 20:06:03,Twitter Web App,125,311,corona; 
Earlier today I spoke with @GovLarryHogan and Montgomery County Executive @Marc_Elrich about the three coronavirus cases in Maryland. We’re all working in partnership at the federal state and county level to ensure that we have the resources in place to confront this outbreak.,2020-03-07 02:21:07,Twitter for iPhone,25,122,corona; 
Next week NIH will start Phase 1 clinical trials for a coronavirus vaccine in Washington State. Then proceed to Phase 2 and larger-scale efficacy testing. I was informed that a vaccine is unlikely to be available for at least 12-18 months which is fast by historical standards.,2020-03-07 00:51:36,Twitter Web App,42,119,corona; 
After voting for the $8.3 billion plan to combat the coronavirus @RepRaskin @SenatorCardin and I visited @NIH to hear from the scientists who are on the front lines. NIH is a national treasure and we must ensure they have the resources they need to protect the public health. https://t.co/krLWGaEVxQ,2020-03-07 00:50:40,Twitter Web App,24,98,corona; 
We just visited the lab working to research and develop a potential coronavirus vaccine.   Our priority is to ensure that Americans are able to protect themselves against the virus.

Big Pharma cannot be allowed to take taxpayer funds and then price-gouge them. I joined with @JanSchakowsky @RepLloydDoggett and @RosaDelauro to demand that tests treatments and vaccines for coronavirus be available affordable and accessible to all. https://t.co/8SsyTRllQA,2020-03-06 16:36:39,Twitter Media Studio,43,97,corona;

Fortunately the Congress has—on a bipartisan basis—rejected the Trump Administration’s grossly insufficient coronavirus response plan and assembled a robust $8.3 billion plan to address the crisis in a strategic and comprehensive way. The House and Senate should pass it now.,2020-03-04 23:36:35,Twitter Web App,36,145,corona; 
Even in the midst of the coronavirus crisis the Trump Administration seeks to promote junk plans that endanger access to care and is asking the courts to rip away protections from millions with pre-existing health conditions. Republicans need to end their partisan lawsuit. https://t.co/KOakqdMmCY,2020-03-02 19:10:47,Twitter Web App,122,271,corona; 
While Congress works to pass emergency bipartisan legislation and additional funding to fully combat the coronavirus it’s critical that everyone stay informed on what you can do to protect yourself and others. Find out more: https://t.co/OyS9TnZ68Y,2020-03-02 17:47:51,Twitter Web App,17,37,corona; 
Pence grossly mismanaged an HIV outbreak in Indiana because his political biases clashed with public health facts. Now he's leading our effort against the coronavirus? We asked for emergency funding weeks ago and now have a congressional proposal. Trump needs to get serious.,2020-02-27 19:23:06,Twitter Web App,120,411,corona; 
Now they want to price gouge for a potential coronavirus vaccine too? It’s unacceptable to tell Americans: If you can’t afford the price that Big Pharma decides you’re out of luck—even if your tax dollars pay to develop it. https://t.co/gKCB8qwNC4,2020-02-27 00:06:48,Twitter Web App,175,379,corona;
