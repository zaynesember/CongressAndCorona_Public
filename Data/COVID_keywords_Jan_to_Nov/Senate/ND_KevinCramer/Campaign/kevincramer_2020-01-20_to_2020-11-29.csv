Again @JoeBiden didn’t offer a single thing he would do to China for sending COVID to us and the moderator let him by with it. She asked for “specific plans.”  Go @realDonaldTrump #Debates2020,2020-10-23 01:44:01,Twitter for iPhone,13,51,covid; 
Isn’t the moderator going to insist @JoeBiden answer the question about having a specific plan to combat COVID? #Debates2020,2020-10-23 01:16:34,Twitter for iPhone,6,25,covid; 
I almost feel sorry for @KamalaHarris . On one hand she says @realDonaldTrump hasn’t shut down enough things to end COVID and blames him for the economic slump. She thinks the American people are idiots. @Mike_Pence respects the American people. #VPDebate #Debates2020,2020-10-08 01:48:45,Twitter for iPad,9,44,covid; 
She begins with a whopper of a lie by repeating the @AP fact checked and discredited line that @realDonaldTrump called COVID a “hoax.” I suspect its the beginning of a trend. #VPDebate #Debates2020,2020-10-08 01:14:22,Twitter for iPad,11,30,covid;
