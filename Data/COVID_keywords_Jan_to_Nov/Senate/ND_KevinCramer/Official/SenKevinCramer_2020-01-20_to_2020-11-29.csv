Russia &amp; Saudi Arabia are both bad actors in the oil dispute but the Saudis are the most disappointing.  They pretend to be an ally but they're using #COVID19 to bankrupt American shale.

Funding Strategic Petroleum Reserve purchases is a small simple way to purchase oil from local producers as we combat #COVID19 &amp; work to end the harmful oil dispute between Saudi Arabia &amp; Russia.

One important takeaway from our @WhiteHouse energy meeting is the banking community must realize the important economic role the oil and gas industry plays.
