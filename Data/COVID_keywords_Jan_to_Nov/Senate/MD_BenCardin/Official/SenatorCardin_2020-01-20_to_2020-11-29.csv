Today is #ImagineADayWithoutWater. More than 2 million Americans are living without basic access to safe drinking water &amp; sanitation.

In March my colleagues &amp; I called on the Trump admin to reverse this proposal.

HCC's legacy is a reminder of why we must continue to invest in our community colleges - especially during #COVID19.

Health care for 133 million Americans w/ preexisting conditions - including the millions who survived #COVID19 - would be at risk if Republicans confirm their #SCOTUS nominee &amp; repeal the ACA.

Withdrawing from WHO will have serious consequences for our nation &amp; the global fight against #COVID19.
