We have a responsibility to protect our elections and ensure that every citizen across our country has a say in their government. That’s why I cosponsored legislation with @SenAmyKlobuchar and @RonWyden to ensure Americans can vote amidst the #COVID19 crisis. https://t.co/uBieu4tSkF,2020-03-19 19:32:50,Twitter Web App,46,99,covid;

Today I voted for the #FamiliesFirstCoronavirusResponseAct.

As the Trump administration responds to the #coronavirus outbreak they should meaningfully engage with Native communities and Tribal leaders to ensure they have access to #COVID19 resources &amp; up-to-date information regarding the presence of COVID-19 in their communities. https://t.co/nLkj4rUCy5,2020-03-18 17:24:29,Twitter for iPhone,26,83,covid; corona; 
I urged @HHSgov @SecAzar to provide timely delivery of personal protective equipment. I remain concerned that the current supply of PPE is inadequate to meet the need in Washington state. #COVID19WA #COVID19Seattle    https://t.co/Ndp2HYUcyR,2020-03-17 16:21:41,Twitter for iPhone,12,44,covid; 
The lack of personal protective equipment endangers the health of people on the frontlines including local health agencies health workers and emergency personnel and limits their ability to respond to those in need and to efficiently curtail the #COVID19 pandemic.,2020-03-17 16:21:40,Twitter for iPhone,21,66,covid; 
Last week I joined @RepDelBene to urge the #IRS to extend the tax filing deadline for 6 months in light of the #COVID19 outbreak. Disruptions in business due to the outbreak present unique challenges to our taxpayers &amp; communities – they need relief. https://t.co/rkfWJUXcn6,2020-03-16 20:25:09,Twitter Web App,25,62,covid;

This declaration will free up more than $50 billion in federal resources for states &amp; local communities fighting the #COVID19 outbreak on the front lines. It will allow WA hospitals more flexibility to care for patients &amp; expand critical testing.,2020-03-14 00:54:51,Twitter for iPhone,3,16,covid;
