82% of COVID-related deaths in NH have occurred among nursing home residents – the highest rate in the U.S. Yet @HHSgov’s formula for distributing funds isn’t providing NH facilities the support they need to match the scope of the crisis in these facilities.

Another reason why the Trump admin should drop its ACA lawsuit: If SCOTUS strikes down the ACA it could eliminate requirement for insurers to cover a COVID-19 vaccine w/o copays&amp;deductibles.
