Great end to a wonderful Get Out The Vote day at Shane’s Texas Pit in Hampton.

Granite Staters and millions more Americans are still struggling to pay the bills find a job and put food on the table.

We need leadership in a crisis. Trump has failed to act on COVID-19 but @CorkyForSenate has praised him from the beginning - even as hundreds of thousands lost their lives.

When New Hampshire needed help to overcome COVID-19 I pushed for billions in funding for our small businesses for testing and tracing and to put people back to work.  If my opponent were in the Senate we wouldn’t have gotten any relief at all. #NHPR,2020-10-15 13:18:35,Twitter Web App,10,28,covid;
