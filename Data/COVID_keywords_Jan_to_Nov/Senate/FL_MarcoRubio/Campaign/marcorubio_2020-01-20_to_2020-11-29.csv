10000 positive tests in one day in #Florida is unsettling &amp; certainly not irrelevant  But many of them won’t get sick  The real concern is how many high risk people will they end up infecting  Why we need daily numbers on admissions for #COVID-19 treatment in hospitals &amp; in ICU https://t.co/9eVqi8gnwo,2020-07-02 23:14:34,Twitter for iPad,190,905,covid; 
#Florida surge isn’t because opened too fast  It’s because we got complacent &amp;/or assumed group socializing was safe  Lockdown isn’t the answer  We need to: -restrict settings conducive to spread -indoor mask-wearing -protect +65 &amp; high-risk -daily #’s for #Covid admissions &amp; ICU,2020-07-02 20:49:48,Twitter for iPad,559,2881,covid;

Good to see us starting to utilize the unique advantages the U.S. has over nations relying solely on a central govt response to #Covid_19 -Federalism with effective state &amp; local govts -private sector we can enlist to provide solutions quickly -civil society &amp; community action,2020-03-13 23:59:36,Twitter for iPad,572,3360,covid; 
These cancellations &amp; closings are creating hardships.   But it must happen &amp; we must all do our part.   It’s the only way to slow the #Covid_19 rate of infection &amp; prevent a catastrophic shortage of ICU beds &amp; life support ventilators.

Most urgent shortage we must address immediately is we can’t make the 11000 ventilators we may need to provide life support for severe cases of #Covid_19  #China makes 50% more medical devices than we do &amp; the other countries that can make them will need them for their own cases,2020-03-13 00:58:38,Twitter for iPad,1088,3718,covid; 
Critics have no idea how much I wish #Covid_19 would have proven wrong our warning last year that our pharmaceutical &amp; medical tech trade relationship with #China provides short-term opportunities for U.S. businesses but long-term dangers for our people: https://t.co/y3YJ6MzALk,2020-03-13 00:36:18,Twitter for iPad,1049,2150,covid; 
Sadly true. We allowed our domestic manufacturing capacity to atrophy because it was cheaper &amp; more efficient to have it made abroad. #Covid_19 is exposing this in the medical field. But this dangerous supply chain deficiency extends to dozens of other critical industries. https://t.co/eSl9xUTAEi,2020-03-12 22:49:02,Twitter for iPad,396,1247,covid; 
A potential emergency we must address ASAP in our response to #Covid_19.

#COVID19 is NOT part of a conspiracy to hurt the President. It is a real threat that will disrupt our economy &amp; our daily lives.

#COVID19 isn’t political &amp; our response shouldn’t be guided by electoral politics  Elected leaders should:  1.  Empower experts to provide information  2.

On #COVIDー19 HYSTERIA &amp; COMPLACENCY are the enemy  Instead we should:  1. Regularly provide public with advice from MEDICAL EXPERTS  2. Get test kits to states ASAP  3.
