With over 80% of our communities not accessible by road Alaska has one of the most difficult populations to count in the U.S. Census. In fact #COVID19  has completely disrupted the process in Alaska where all field operations were suspended from mid-March through early May.,2020-08-12 16:41:26,Twitter Web App,5,9,covid; 
U.S. drug overdose deaths saw an increase of 4.8% in 2019 according to @CDCgov data compared to 2018 and #COVID19 has only exacerbated the opioid crisis. This bill will help ensure access to treatments that have saved countless Americans struggling with substance use disorders,2020-08-11 19:01:41,Twitter Web App,4,8,covid; 
Although #COVID19 is at the forefront of people’s minds the fight against the opioid epidemic continues.

In Alaska telehealth has been vital for some time but the coronavirus pandemic has created a new normal and certainly fueled that need. Now telehealth goes beyond creating greater access—it’s also creating safer access.,2020-08-04 16:32:12,Twitter Web App,2,8,corona;

Small business owners in Alaska are working hard to overcome the economic impacts of #COVID19.

I recently introduced a bill w/ Sen. @MartinHeinrich that extends the coverage of Coronavirus Relief Fund payments allocated under the CARES Act to tribal govts allowing the relief funds to be used until December 2022 rather than the original deadline of the end of this year.,2020-08-03 00:25:55,Twitter Web App,4,31,corona; 
Because of delays in the initial coronavirus relief fund payments provided by the CARES Act many American Indian &amp; Alaska Native communities many of which have been disproportionately affected by #COVID19 didn't receive any funds until well after the bill’s statutory deadline.,2020-08-03 00:25:54,Twitter Web App,16,64,covid; corona; 
To help mitigate the spread of #COVID19 those who are traveling through Canada to Alaska for non-discretionary purposes are now required to take the most direct route and enter Canada through one of the five identified @CanBorder ports of entry (POE). https://t.co/tMY22vMhCz,2020-08-01 18:23:52,Twitter Web App,11,16,covid; 
Putting a stop to #COVID19 requires an all-hands-on-deck multifaceted approach at the federal state &amp; local level.

To help alleviate these hardships @SenGaryPeters &amp; I crafted a bill to assist vets &amp; transitioning servicemembers who are using their GI Bill benefits for nontraditional educational programs. We cannot allow our vets to be left behind as we address the impacts of #COVID19.,2020-07-30 23:33:43,Twitter Web App,2,3,covid; 
Many Alaskan industries depend on apprenticeships &amp; on-the-job training to educate future employees including a number of America’s vets. Due to #COVID19 many traditional education programs have shifted to online platforms- a difficult task for OTJ training &amp; apprenticeships. https://t.co/H5vxa3zyxg,2020-07-30 23:33:43,Twitter Web App,9,8,covid;
