From start to finish Republicans disregarded the COVID-19 pandemic in their rush to confirm Judge Barrett before Election Day. All the while #COVID19 cases spiked across the US.

For months Sen. McConnell couldn’t find time to negotiate a #COVID19 relief deal. Now he wants to drop everything to fill a Supreme Court vacancy.   Why?

Just yesterday the U.S. recorded its 3rd highest coronavirus case count since this pandemic began. So today the Trump Admin. announces that it will cut off federal funding to operate #COVID19 testing sites in Illinois &amp; 4 other states.

Jesus is not alone — 41700 #DACA recipients are essential health care workers on the frontlines of the #COVID19 pandemic. Pres.
