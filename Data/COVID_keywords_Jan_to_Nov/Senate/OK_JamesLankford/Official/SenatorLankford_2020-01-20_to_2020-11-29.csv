These fees hurt community pharmacies &amp; caused many to shut their doors over the years further harming communities who depend on them for medications. Congress can’t keep turning a blind eye to skyrocketing drug prices especially during the financial hardship due to #COVID19.,2020-07-23 16:23:37,Twitter Web App,1,8,covid; 
As we continue to discuss the next #COVID19 relief bill it’s important we discuss ways to bring down the cost of drug prices.

Warrior’s Refuge is a perfect example of non-profits stepping up in times of need. They were able to help a single mom of four find and furnish a home after being displaced due to COVID-19.

You are either helping right now or hurting. Pelosi's handpicked partisan ploys are helping no one. She's hurting American families by prioritizing airplane emissions same day voter registration &amp; wind energy tax credits over #coronavirus relief. #StopTheGamesNancy #PasstheBill,2020-03-24 14:00:00,Twitter Web App,211,650,corona;

I keep hearing from my Democrat colleagues that this COVID relief bill is not enough. It's $2 trillion!!,2020-03-23 18:27:05,Twitter Web App,247,1005,covid; 
It is unbelievable that Democrats would stall the relief bill. Senate Democrats have written many sections of the economic relief bill already - Now they are holding hostage critical support to combat the COVID19 pandemic for more demands. We need to get aid moving quickly.,2020-03-22 22:45:43,Twitter Web App,3981,7173,covid;

I voted against the second COVID-19 funding bill.
