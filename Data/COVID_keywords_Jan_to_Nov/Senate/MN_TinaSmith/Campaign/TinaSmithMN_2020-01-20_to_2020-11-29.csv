It was a pleasure to join @BradTabke and Sahra Odowa as we toured Downtown Shakopee today. Small business owners have been hit particularly hard by COVID-19 and I was humbled to be able to speak with them hear their stories and talk about the work that we need to do. https://t.co/URanBYQT2E,2020-07-14 02:32:29,Twitter Web App,4,43,covid; 
32% of Americans missed housing payments in July. The lack of affordable housing has been exacerbated by the economic fallout of COVID-19. I’m working to get renters protection and expand affordable housing projects in the next COVID-19 relief package. https://t.co/yd6Fq4KEWi,2020-07-13 22:42:14,Twitter Web App,12,51,covid; 
Yesterday I joined Sen. @founghawj &amp; Rep. @KaohlyVangHer to visit the Sun Ray Shopping Center in St. Paul. Small businesses in this community have been hit especially hard by COVID-19 and recent city-wide riots. We need to ensure they have the resources to come back stronger. https://t.co/7Mvo1NRzlJ,2020-07-11 21:29:28,Twitter Web App,8,32,covid; 
I joined Sen. @BobMenendezNJ and my colleagues in calling for increased public transit funding in the next COVID-19 stimulus package. Public transit is essential for millions of Americans. We need to make sure these systems have the resources they need to serve our communities.,2020-07-11 19:20:05,Twitter Web App,11,75,covid; 
This is truly a crisis within a crisis. COVID-19 has further exposed the racial disparities that plague the United States. We must do better. https://t.co/z5NMKr0Zn7,2020-07-08 22:01:27,Twitter Web App,8,37,covid; 
Last week I signed a letter to AG Barr expressing concern about the closures of polling locations in tribal communities due to COVID-19. Indigenous communities must have proper access to the ballot box.,2020-07-08 21:24:09,Twitter Web App,24,149,covid; 
As COVID-19 cases continue to rise across the country health care workers on the frontlines still lack proper access to PPE. The Trump Administration needs to make this a top priority.,2020-07-06 20:46:38,Twitter Web App,10,58,covid; 
This is systemic racism. Black and Brown Americans already faced large housing disparities because of their race &amp; income. COVID-19 is only exacerbating these issues. https://t.co/1UbCso6hpe,2020-07-05 18:57:29,Twitter Web App,16,60,covid; 
The #FourthOfJuly parades on the Iron Range are some of my favorite events of the year.

Coronavirus cases are rising across a majority of states. Yet Trump wants to host a big event with no social distancing for the Fourth of July. When will he put American lives first?  https://t.co/LPookG4BtX,2020-06-30 23:00:54,Twitter Web App,29,119,corona; 
.@EWarren is right. COVID-19 is taking a toll on childcare providers and we’ve got to act now to stop it from further impacting our economy. We have a plan to do just that. I’m glad to be in this fight together. https://t.co/6FKCDijr2j,2020-06-29 21:35:56,Twitter Web App,33,171,covid; 
Even in these unprecedented times for our economy I’m proud of Minnesotans for stepping up to the cause and taking care of one another. So many have been harmed financially due to COVID-19.

Thanks to Steven and Jodi Read of @shepswayfarms for giving @AngieCraigMN and me a tour of your wonderful sheep dairy farm. Farms of all sizes have been impacted by COVID-19.

Dr. Fauci is right: COVID-19 is still a major risk to our communities. Keep wearing masks. Keep social distancing. And get tested if you’re experiencing symptoms.  https://t.co/C1Pfg2jaAT,2020-06-24 22:37:40,Twitter Web App,24,94,covid;

Since the pandemic began the Asian American and Pacific Islander community has faced an increase in discrimination and attacks. It’s shameful that our leaders would perpetuate hate by creating racist nicknames for COVID-19.,2020-06-22 21:57:02,Twitter Web App,30,182,covid; 
It was an honor to speak w/ faith leaders at Greater Friendship Missionary Baptist Church.

George Floyd’s death was one of many events that revealed racial injustices and inequalities in our society. These injustices extend beyond police brutality. They exist in our schools too. We cannot let COVID-19 deepen inequalities. https://t.co/Pz6sudc3Wn,2020-06-14 19:05:12,Twitter Web App,13,70,covid;

Right now we must make sure families can stay in their homes &amp; are able to pay their bills. If you don’t have a safe place to live nothing else in your life works. Families are hurting.

In MN telehealth visits increased from about 1K/day before COVID-19 to up to 15K/day in late April.

Today @ewarren and I are introducing the COVID-19 Testing Inventory Act. Right now there’s a lack of transparency when it comes to how many coronavirus tests we have &amp; how to get access to tests.
