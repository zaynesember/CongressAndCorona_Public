Our number one priority must be to keep Minnesotans safe as we work to contain and prevent spread of the coronavirus.  I support @GovTimWalz's decision today. This unprecedented time requires action.   https://t.co/Zr43uUdI5X,2020-03-13 19:47:44,Twitter Web App,10,57,corona; 
Please take care and don’t hesitate to call either my Washington or Minnesota office if we can help. You can find accurate up-to-date information about COVID-19 by visiting https://t.co/i7BbuuWGCL,2020-03-13 16:30:04,Twitter Web App,4,28,covid; 
My other bill would ensure that no person—with or without insurance—incurs cost-sharing when receiving a test to confirm a COVID-19 infection. Specifically this bill waives cost-sharing for COVID-19 diagnostic testing and testing-related services—such as the cost of a visit.,2020-03-13 16:30:04,Twitter Web App,7,47,covid; 
One bill would prohibit employers from firing punishing or otherwise discriminating against a worker who is quarantined or isolated—or who is caring for a family member in quarantine or isolation—amid the COVID-19 pandemic.,2020-03-13 16:30:04,Twitter Web App,4,32,covid; 
I will continue to work in Minnesota and Washington on the federal response to COVID-19. Yesterday I intro'd two bills to help contain and prevent spread of the virus.,2020-03-13 16:30:04,Twitter Web App,4,15,covid; 
As your Senator my top priority as we respond to the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak is to help keep Minnesotans healthy. This is a serious public health event and we all must work together to help stop the spread of this virus.,2020-03-13 16:30:03,Twitter Web App,12,111,covid; corona; 
(1/3) Last week VP Pence told Congress the U.S. would have a million tests for coronavirus by Friday. That was untrue.,2020-03-13 00:39:31,Twitter Web App,50,215,corona; 
Trump has obstructed efforts to contain &amp; suppress coronavirus &amp; has misled ppl about how serious it is. Tonight—after weeks—he tells us the way to stop this “foreign virus” is to stop travel to Europe. Can’t imagine a worse example of leadership when our country needs it most.,2020-03-12 02:33:51,Twitter Web App,42,295,corona; 
My colleagues and I from both sides of the aisle agree: the federal government needs to actively work w/ Native communities &amp; Tribal leaders as a part of efforts to address the coronavirus. That’s what we’re urging VP Pence to do &amp; thanks @SenatorTomUdall for leading this push. https://t.co/9395qMKtcm,2020-03-09 18:51:00,Twitter Web App,6,30,corona; 
My top priority is helping to keep Minnesotans healthy and safe during this #coronavirus outbreak. I'm monitoring it closely and am in contact with federal state and local partners. Thanks to Minnesota’s health care providers and public health officials for all you’re doing.,2020-03-09 17:31:40,Twitter Web App,17,112,corona; 
Minnesota has its first reported case of coronavirus. My office has talked with the Governor’s office; the patient is isolated and they are working to find those who may have come in contact with them. To stay up to date visit @mnhealth: https://t.co/D8oNAzhgcn,2020-03-06 21:36:40,Twitter for iPhone,44,81,corona; 
A privilege to work on this with you Senator. It is essential that the U.S. work with and provide resources to tribal communities in the fight against coronavirus. https://t.co/9395qMKtcm,2020-03-05 23:03:26,Twitter Web App,17,60,corona; 
When it comes to public health it's important to build the health infrastructure before a crisis hits not just afterwards.   That's exactly what the folks at @mnlpha are doing. I got to talk to them today about their crucial efforts on the ground in MN to combat coronavirus. https://t.co/2bIDqnXqix,2020-03-05 20:42:12,Twitter Web App,4,36,corona; 
Having an accurate and comprehensive census is fundamental to our democracy.   While coronavirus continues to spread I’m pushing to ensure the census isn’t affected; we need a full and accurate count. And we must protect census workers’ health &amp; safety. https://t.co/mwXskyP1aO,2020-03-04 23:10:03,Twitter Web App,23,40,corona; 
As the Coronavirus continues to spread across the United States I asked a panel of officials in charge of our response what exactly can be done when even the President and his allies in the right wing media are spreading misinformation on social platforms. https://t.co/0zvOQlb5uH,2020-03-03 20:40:33,Twitter Media Studio,17,103,corona; 
For folks who want a resource with up-to-date and accurate information about Coronavirus @CDCgov is that place. Here's the link to their website:   https://t.co/8WVXripOp6,2020-03-02 22:19:29,Twitter Web App,5,23,corona; 
Again I’m supporting a proposal that will provide more than the administration requested to fight Coronavirus.   There is zero reason to be using this outbreak as an excuse to try to take away people’s ability to pay for heat during the winter. https://t.co/ZaATlXz9Z4,2020-02-27 21:51:06,Twitter Web App,38,96,corona; 
There’s a proposal led by @SenSchumer that would give the Trump Administration ample funding to fight Coronavirus.  They should support it and stop taking away dollars meant to help folks who need heat in the dead of winter.,2020-02-26 20:35:25,Twitter Web App,45,144,corona; 
@PattyMurray @SenWarren 3) There have been explicit promises by the Trump administration to provide testing kits to states so they can screen for Coronavirus. It still hasn’t happened for many states and that needs to be fixed immediately.   Promises made need to be kept. Period.,2020-02-25 22:53:20,Twitter Web App,8,50,corona; 
1) Before Trump the President’s national security team had a point person to coordinate on outbreaks like Coronavirus. Trump left that position open for years and it’s obvious it needs to be brought back. I’ve been pushing with @PattyMurray and @SenWarren to make this happen.,2020-02-25 22:48:25,Twitter Web App,155,633,corona; 
We need a plan to deal with the Coronavirus and so far the Trump administration’s response has been inadequate.    I want to highlight a few concrete things the administration should be doing to get a handle on this.[THREAD],2020-02-25 22:46:05,Twitter Web App,21,85,corona;
