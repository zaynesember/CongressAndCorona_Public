It’s up to each of us how we celebrate Thanksgiving. Please be responsible. We'd all like to gather w/ lots of family &amp; friends but COVID is real. Do your part to spread love &amp; cheer not COVID. Be safe vigilant &amp; help protect others so we can all celebrate together in 2021!,2020-11-25 12:51:06,Twitter Web App,24,181,covid; 
This week we give thanks &amp; I'm thankful for all of you. 2020 has been challenging to say the least. But I’m grateful to be part of a caring (socially distant) community; to represent RI; &amp; for friends family &amp; #frontlineworkers. What are you thankful for this #Thanksgiving?,2020-11-24 16:44:47,Twitter Web App,16,157,socially distant; 
Ascertainment was step one. Now Senate Republican leaders must take step two and allow a COVID-relief bill to come to the floor so Congress can swiftly pass a bill to protect public health &amp; people’s economic well-being.,2020-11-24 01:03:00,Twitter Web App,80,365,covid; 
I know folks are excited. But please keep celebrations #COVIDsafe &amp; socially distanced. Change is coming to the White House but the virus is still rampant &amp; we must protect #publichealth.,2020-11-08 01:59:57,Twitter for iPhone,42,310,covid; 
1000 #COVID deaths yesterday isn’t “almost nothing.” It’s tragic. Heartbreaking. Unacceptable. Instead of downplaying the rising death toll we must confront it.  Getting this virus under control requires caring thoughtful honest leadership &amp; unity. https://t.co/fj2xlC4gFR,2020-10-30 18:19:07,Twitter Web App,17,55,covid; 
Looking for a new #COVIDsafe adult #Halloween tradition this year? Please consider donating blood to @RIBloodCenter. It’s not spooky but it could help save a life. Unfortunately there is a critical blood shortage in RI right now. Be a hero this Halloween &amp; #donateblood.,2020-10-29 19:23:58,Twitter Web App,13,37,covid; 
Amidst the hardship of #COVID it’s heartwarming to see people doing their part to protect the health &amp; safety of others. This virus has reshaped many things but it hasn’t changed our shared values or the basic goodness of people. Thanks to all those making a difference!,2020-10-29 15:56:36,Twitter Web App,4,32,covid; 
COVID is keeping us apart but the only way to effectively combat it is by working together. We must each do our part. Please #WearAMask. Please take proper #COVID precautions. I know #COVIDFatigue is real but the virus is spreading &amp; we all need to step up to help save lives.,2020-10-28 15:48:22,Twitter Web App,11,53,covid; 
Instead of passing #COVIDrelief Senate Republicans rushed to the WH to clink #SCOTUS champagne flutes &amp; then skipped town. But not before scheduling the 1st vote of the #lameduck session on… wait for it… a judicial nominee. Americans deserve better. https://t.co/YnprtDs0QY,2020-10-28 14:58:08,Twitter Web App,22,57,covid; 
When a #COVIDvaccine is ruled scientifically safe it should be FREE for all Americans. Trump Admin initially was going to let #redtape force some seniors to pay. I intro'ed the Ensuring Access to COVID-19 Vaccines for Seniors Act (S. 4825). Now Trump Admin is reversing course.,2020-10-27 17:41:38,Twitter Web App,11,56,covid; 
The U.S. Senate must help combat #COVID; deliver relief for struggling families biz &amp; communities; &amp; turn our economy around. Instead GOP leaders chose a lifetime job for 1 extreme #SCOTUS nom. over #publichealth the health of our economy &amp; the needs of hardworking Americans. https://t.co/eImNNwYp81,2020-10-21 19:01:22,Twitter Web App,71,200,covid; 
Outrageous. After 5 months of inaction Sen. McConnell scheduled a #showvote on a cynical ‘skinny’ #COVIDrelief bill that is completely inadequate.

Families small businesses &amp; jobless Americans are struggling to pay bills. Instead of providing them robust relief Pres Trump is thrashing around trying to provide himself political cover. He can’t even agree w/ GOP leaders &amp; is not serious about a #COVIDrelief bill.,2020-10-09 19:25:04,Twitter for iPhone,38,124,covid; 
RI is leading when it comes to coordinating a communitywide response to combat #COVID. Today I toured the state’s education operations center (#EDOC) &amp; met w/ @RINationalGuard @RIHEALTH @RIDeptEd to get a firsthand look at school safety initiatives. https://t.co/FWJIrbSqvE,2020-10-08 20:52:58,Twitter Web App,6,28,covid; 
It didn’t have to be this way. Pres Trump’s inept handling of #COVID &amp; Congressional Republicans’ refusal to extend #unemploymentinsurance to job seekers made things worse deepening &amp; extending recession. https://t.co/t8oHMzfDRp,2020-10-07 13:24:00,Twitter Web App,27,64,covid; 
If #POTUS can get #COVID then anyone can. COVID is still rampant. Other nations have effectively contained it the U.S. has not. We're lagging due to lack of presidential leadership. Willful ignorance is not a strategy it's a dangerous Rx for more infection &amp; prolonged crisis.,2020-10-06 20:20:45,Twitter Web App,64,234,covid; 
Saving lives means investing in training &amp; infrastructure long before disaster hits. Visited @RhodeIslandEMA HQ in Cranston today to offer thanks to Dir.

Senate Republicans are rushing the process to install an extremist #SCOTUS Justice but they are in no rush whatsoever to help families &amp; communities who’ve been hit hardest by Trump Admin’s mismanagement of #COVID.,2020-10-01 22:16:49,Twitter Web App,74,178,covid; 
Dark days ahead if Senate GOP &amp; Trump Admin continue blocking comprehensive bipartisan #COVIDrelief. New @wapo story exposes rising rate of unpaid utility bills &amp; threat it poses. That’s why I’m working to boost #LIHEAP &amp; create a #HousingAssistanceFund. https://t.co/Ox2bJ5CqzZ,2020-10-01 16:45:12,Twitter Web App,7,27,covid; 
As we work to contain #COVID we must also stop the spread of #disinformation that threatens public health. Intro'ed new bill w/ @maziehirono &amp; colleagues to provide $1 million booster shot to help immunize American public from false &amp; misleading info &amp; trace the spread.,2020-09-29 20:52:14,Twitter for iPhone,35,159,covid; 
Congress must swiftly investigate Trump Admin’s misuse of $300M in #CDC funds that could have gone to helping #COVID patients &amp; developing a vaccine but was instead diverted to a wasteful self-promoting propaganda campaign. https://t.co/wp73XMBygR,2020-09-26 16:15:16,Twitter for iPhone,51,86,covid; 
Trump Admin must stop downplaying contagiousness of #COVID &amp; trying to suppress facts. Arm people with accurate info &amp; they can make smart choices. Suppressing scientific findings like this to try to boost Trump’s electoral chances is sick &amp; wrong. https://t.co/mo6mpGgqRv,2020-09-21 19:21:32,Twitter Web App,21,50,covid; 
Pres Trump now claims CDC Dir. Robert Redfield was 'confused' when he answered my question about #COVID &amp; #facemask efficacy. Both the science &amp; the answer are clear. Instead of pressuring doctors Pres Trump should encourage people to wear masks in public https://t.co/xUFV2Dq9rc,2020-09-17 01:33:00,Twitter Web App,67,170,covid; 
Like states our cities &amp; towns need help to fight the pandemic. That’s why we pushed for this community block grant money for RI.  $7.6 million in #CDBG is now on its way to help communities combat COVID &amp; support their economic priorities. https://t.co/v0w4Gxn9Ld,2020-09-14 20:57:58,Twitter for iPhone,7,14,covid; 
After months of inaction the GOP's #COVID bill failed because it was an inadequate negligent package that would leave millions in the lurch. We need to pass a bill that protects hospitals nursing homes frontline workers &amp; communities hit hardest by the virus...now.,2020-09-11 00:27:37,Twitter for iPhone,99,286,covid; 
Congressional Republicans took a break from their work responding to #COVID but the virus didn’t take a pause. Thousands are dying &amp; millions have contracted COVID. Americans deserve more than a partisan show vote -- they need a comprehensive response &amp; overdue assistance.,2020-09-08 16:24:29,Twitter Web App,84,183,covid; 
Hope you have a safe enjoyable #LaborDay. Today is a great day to support local businesses &amp; honor workers who are on the job by wearing a mask &amp; maintaining a safe social distance.,2020-09-07 18:58:34,Twitter for iPhone,8,61,social distance;

Safe effective vaccines help prevent disease &amp; protect public health. Transparency is key to boosting trust &amp; ensuring public confidence.

COVID-19 has transformed how we live work &amp; grieve. But it hasn’t changed who we are or limited our capacity to care for one another. All of us have reason to hope &amp; remain vigilant. Brighter days lay ahead. But today we pause to reflect on those we’ve lost &amp; honor their lives.,2020-07-24 14:00:49,Twitter Web App,7,18,covid; 
Each of us must ask: How can we do a better job going forward to prevent the loss of more lives? We are each other’s keepers. It is up to every single one of us to do our part (#WearAMask #SocialDistance etc) to keep ourselves &amp; each other healthy &amp; safe.,2020-07-24 14:00:48,Twitter Web App,4,15,socialdistance; 
We pause &amp; reflect on the toll this pandemic has taken &amp; grieve those gone too soon. 1000+ RI lives lost to COVID19: a staggering immeasurable loss of neighbors friends &amp; family.

The health of American people &amp; U.S. economy must come first. Instead of forcing #unemployment aid to lapse while Republicans fight among themselves Senate GOP should join Dems in extending #UI to save people &amp; businesses as COVID cases are surging.  https://t.co/E2MSXJn3Uo,2020-07-22 20:15:22,Twitter Web App,5,16,covid; 
Don't give up America! We are so much better &amp; more capable than this. #COVID19 is a mindless virus. We can combat it by being smart considerate &amp; taking proper precautions. If Pres Trump doesn't want to unify &amp; lead that's his problem. But the U.S. can &amp; will overcome COVID.,2020-07-15 17:30:51,Twitter Web App,65,244,covid; 
Health workers need #PPE to protect themselves &amp; prevent spread of infection. With #COVID19 spiking nationwide we're seeing signs of another #PPEshortage.

As #COVID19 cases spike in states around U.S. the Trump Admin must extend the #PublicHealthEmergency declaration or it will expire on July 25. I urge Trump Admin to act now to ensure #telehealth #telementalhealth &amp; other #CARESAct measures &amp; reforms can continue beyond 7/25.,2020-07-06 20:26:40,Twitter Web App,36,104,covid; 
Additional state &amp; local aid is absolutely critical to preventing a deeper recession &amp; shortening #COVID19 crisis. People states &amp; communities are reeling &amp; need federal help to improve health &amp; reopen the right way: with proven strategies for testing tracing &amp; quarantine.,2020-07-06 14:42:47,Twitter Web App,41,121,covid; 
People can’t work if they’re sick. They can’t work if schools &amp; daycare are closed. Many Republicans want to use the June jobs snapshot as an excuse for inaction. But COVID-cases are skyrocketing now. The longer GOP delays the harder it will be for schools to safely reopen.,2020-07-06 14:38:55,Twitter Web App,81,301,covid; 
America’s economic stability &amp; success depend on getting #COVID19 under control. U.S. needs an evidence-based approach to improving #publichealth.

ATTN RI Small Biz: New law extending the deadline for #smallbiz to apply for aid under the #PaycheckProtectionProgram (#PPP) was just signed.

Pres Trump’s short-sighted political pressure to reopen before a national strategy of testing tracing &amp; quarantine were firmly in place has cost U.S. dearly.

If Trump-backed #ACArepeal lawsuit succeeds millions of sick people will end up in emergency rooms with nowhere else to go &amp; no way to pay &amp; it will cost taxpayers far more in the long run.

The reason U.S. #unemployment is as high as it is today (twice as high as EU unemployment rate) is because Pres Trump failed to take #COVID19 threat seriously &amp; instead treated it like a stock market issue. Too many Americans are still out of work. We can &amp; must do better.,2020-06-05 16:47:23,Twitter Web App,21,121,covid; 
It’s the first of the month &amp; the rent is due but millions of Americans impacted by #COVID19 are struggling to pay through no fault of their own.

Nobody wants to hear this but we're still in the early stages of the battle vs. #COVID19. We can get it under control. But to stop it from returning we can't allow our defenses to crumble. We must invest more in testing hospitals &amp; health workers #PPE research &amp; vaccine.,2020-04-09 14:36:01,Twitter Web App,63,186,covid; 
Hospitals health centers &amp; primary care practices are cornerstones of our communities &amp; public health. If they collapse under the strain of #COVID19 everyone suffers.

Hospitals are on the front lines of #COVID19 pandemic &amp; Sen. McConnell knows they need more help. The #CARESAct included $100B for hospitals &amp; health centers but now the Trump Admin seems to be trying to divert hospital funds to pay for other things. https://t.co/n2U3VAqOy8,2020-04-09 14:22:37,Twitter Web App,23,22,covid; 
Pres Trump’s lack of coordination &amp; failure to fully utilize #DPA in midst of #COVID19 pandemic means states bid against each other for scarce medical equipment &amp; #PPE driving up costs for all &amp; making it harder for states w/ most urgent need to access life-saving gear. #PPENow,2020-04-05 18:28:12,Twitter Web App,38,93,covid;

RI’s #coronavirus disaster declaration has been officially granted paving way for additional federal help to bolster RI’s emergency protective measures.

State gov’ts are working OT to combat #coronavirus &amp; help people. As a result they're now facing fiscal cliffs.

A quick history of why Emergency Coronavirus Relief package is delayed &amp; where we’re at:  - Bipartisan Taskforce works on bill - McConnell scraps bipartisan work &amp; adds $500B slush fund - Dems say no way - Bipartisan talks resume progress - McConnell show votes slow things down,2020-03-23 18:12:36,Twitter Web App,90,169,corona; 
Shouldn’t Republicans want to help food banks mental health clinics community-based nursing homes rape crisis centers &amp; other nonprofits as part of #coronavirus response?

We're making progress on an emergency #coronavirus rescue plan. But show votes on McConnell’s $500B slushfund only slows things down.

The nat'l shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) is making #COVID19 pandemic worse.

Suspending federal student loan repayments is a start. But the federal gov’t should be doing more to ease the financial burden caused by the #coronavirus pandemic.
