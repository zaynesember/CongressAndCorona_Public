McGrath wants to eliminate the private sector from health care.   Imagine what dire straits we would be in if we were entirely reliant on govt to provide therapeutics and ultimately a vaccine for coronavirus.

The only COVID bill Amy McGrath supports is Nancy Pelosi’s 1800 page radical liberal wish list.   A bill that would send more rescue funds to Puerto Rico than it would to Kentucky and give tax breaks to blue state millionaires. #KYSen #TheKentuckyDebate,2020-10-12 23:04:14,Twitter Web App,22,32,covid;
