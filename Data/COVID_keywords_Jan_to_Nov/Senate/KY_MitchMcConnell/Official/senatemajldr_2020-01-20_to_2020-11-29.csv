Our country badly needs the kinds of targeted urgent COVID relief that Republicans have been trying to pass for months — from job-saving PPP funding to vaccine distribution.   My full statement: https://t.co/ybJ2OJSYf9,2020-11-20 20:20:48,Twitter for iPhone,711,4096,covid; 
For months Republicans have tried to make bipartisan progress on huge areas of COVID relief where there's no disagreement.  Vaccine distribution funds.  Another round of the PPP for hard-hit small businesses.   But Democrats blocked it all over their unrelated liberal wish-list.,2020-11-18 21:10:29,Twitter Web App,4659,16254,covid; 
.@ChuckGrassley had not missed a single vote in 27 years. Yesterday he paused that streak on doctors’ orders while awaiting a COVID test result.    The Senate is praying for continued good health for our president pro tempore and looking forward to seeing him again soon.,2020-11-18 17:23:30,Twitter Web App,1280,10818,covid; 
Another Democrat demand that’s blocked bipartisan aid: The fixation on a massive slush fund for state &amp; city govt's unlinked from COVID need.  Some states are taking in more tax revenue this fall than they did before the pandemic.   It's struggling families who need urgent help.,2020-11-17 19:48:31,Twitter Web App,2648,10149,covid; 
More huge news this morning in COVID-19 vaccine development. The kinds of headlines we've longed for.  But we must stay careful for the next weeks and months. Wear our masks. Keep social distance. We've come this far and victory is in sight. Let's not surrender to the virus now.,2020-11-16 22:46:19,Twitter Web App,809,6126,covid; social distance; 
This week’s news on a COVID-19 vaccine was incredibly promising. All of us have to keep up commonsense precautions in the meantime. The virus is spreading quickly in Kentucky and nationwide and it doesn’t care whether we’ve gotten bored with wearing masks or social distancing.,2020-11-12 17:30:40,Twitter Web App,876,7400,covid; 
Yesterday we learned one COVID-19 vaccine candidate may be more than 90% effective.   This huge good news is a testament to the ingenuity of the American private sector and the historic groundwork laid by Congress and the Trump Administration. https://t.co/TtcD2TpmJC,2020-11-10 15:52:20,Twitter Web App,1420,6943,covid;

More coronavirus resources are on the way to Kentucky. With the help of @HHSGov &amp; @usedgov Kentucky students &amp; teachers will receive more than two million masks.

Senate Democrats just used the filibuster — which they say they dislike — to kill another coronavirus relief package.   Unemployment benefits. PPP. Testing. Vaccines. School funding. Protections for people with pre-existing conditions.   Every Democrat just voted to block it all.,2020-10-21 17:53:49,Twitter Web App,12433,18577,corona; 
Democrats have said we shouldn’t pass any more relief at all unless Speaker Pelosi gets her whole far-left wish list including all kinds of non-COVID-related demands.   Working families in Kentucky and around the country deserve better than this obstruction.,2020-10-21 16:54:58,Twitter Web App,7169,19445,covid; 
Democrats have delayed aid for months over non-COVID-related liberal demands. Last night Leader Schumer even tried to adjourn the Senate for three weeks. Americans need help; Democrats just want to go home.   We are voting on more aid this week.,2020-10-20 17:15:57,Twitter Web App,12276,31459,covid; 
Speaker Pelosi’s all-or-nothing act has kept Americans waiting for months. We badly need Congress to agree where we can get money out the door now and keep arguing over the Speaker’s non-COVID-related wish list later.  We'll vote on hundreds of billions in more aid this week.,2020-10-20 00:00:11,Twitter for iPhone,6137,16589,covid;

In 2019 under Republican policies:  - Fastest annual growth in household income on record - Working-class &amp; middle-class families saw more of the gains - Poverty lowest since 1950s   That's the leadership our nation will need as we rebuild after COVID. https://t.co/Byrmh3DgD8,2020-09-17 19:35:01,Twitter for iPhone,837,2576,covid; 
Even Speaker Pelosi’s own House Democrats are sick of her blocking COVID-19 relief.  But she insists anything short of her multi-trillion wish list would make Democrats “a cheap date.” What a joke.  People are hurting. They need help. Not the Speaker's pointless political games.,2020-09-16 15:04:22,Twitter Web App,5288,14335,covid; 
Senate Democrats are threatening to blow up the filibuster if they gain power and ram far-left policies through the Senate. But they just used the filibuster last week to block COVID relief. They used it this summer to kill @SenatorTimScott’s police reform bill.  Total hypocrisy.,2020-09-14 19:42:26,Twitter Web App,7508,16589,covid; 
ICYMI I joined @DanaPerino to discuss Speaker Pelosi &amp; Leader Schumer's continued efforts to block coronavirus relief funding for Americans.    Every Senator who voted against relief needs to answer what in the proposal they actually disagreed with. Kids? Jobs? Healthcare? https://t.co/iuGc7fN01A,2020-09-10 22:36:30,Twitter Media Studio,558,1316,corona; 
Every Senate Democrat just voted against hundreds of billions of dollars of COVID-19 relief. They blocked money for schools testing vaccines unemployment insurance and the Paycheck Protection Program.  Their goal is clear: No help for American families before the election.,2020-09-10 17:21:10,Twitter Web App,19896,35956,covid; 
Yesterday reporters asked Sen. Schumer whether by refusing to compromise he was making the perfect the enemy of the good. His response? “Republicans are the enemy of the good.”  Americans are not enemies. COVID-19 is our enemy. It's time for Washington Democrats to act like it.,2020-09-10 17:00:05,Twitter Web App,5456,14472,covid; 
The Senate is voting today on COVID-19 relief. Hundreds of billions more dollars to make schools safe for kids to keep workers getting paid and to invest in treatments and vaccines.  American families will see exactly which Senators want to send them more bipartisan help.,2020-09-10 15:21:35,Twitter Web App,1516,4371,covid; 
Speaker Pelosi &amp; Leader Schumer were attacking our new COVID proposal before they’d even read it.  They’re attacking it over provisions that literally have Democrat cosponsors.  They just don't want Americans getting another cent of bipartisan relief before the November election.,2020-09-09 23:24:09,Twitter for iPhone,4986,11167,covid; 
The coronavirus doesn't care about our election. But it's clear that's all Democrats care about. Look at the facts and ask each Democrat what in the proposal that we're voting on tomorrow they actually disagree with.   More historic funding for schools? Jobs? Healthcare? https://t.co/p38BQjgvKM,2020-09-09 20:26:41,Twitter Media Studio,1300,3330,corona; 
Republicans will not let Speaker Pelosi and Leader Schumer kill COVID relief behind closed doors without putting every Senator on the record.  Tomorrow we'll vote to protect workers' paychecks keep kids safe in school and win the healthcare fight against the virus.,2020-09-09 14:32:59,Twitter Web App,6354,19908,covid; 
Democrats have blocked any new COVID relief saying anything short of their entire far-left wish list is “piecemeal” and “emaciated.”   The same Democrats rushed back to D.C. to pass piecemeal legislation for the Postal Service that did nothing at all for working families.,2020-09-08 23:46:04,Twitter for iPhone,3553,6773,covid; 
Republicans have spent months fighting for more COVID-19 relief. We proposed a major $1T bill. Speaker Pelosi &amp; Leader Schumer said no. We suggested smaller bipartisan deals. They said no again.   Today we put forward yet another proposal. They attacked it before even reading it.,2020-09-08 22:20:38,Twitter Web App,6350,13783,covid; 
Senate Republicans have been trying for months to deliver more COVID-19 relief to American families. Speaker Pelosi and Leader Schumer have blocked us at every turn.

To my Democratic colleagues: The coronavirus doesn't have a stake in this election. Struggling families across America need our help and Republicans stand ready to deliver. https://t.co/97iN3ul3cL,2020-08-27 00:19:01,Twitter Media Studio,1463,5803,corona; 
The coronavirus does not care about the election. Struggling Americans need our help now and that can only happen if Washington Democrats stop playing games and actually help the American people. https://t.co/Xy2ixCAE7A,2020-08-24 21:29:56,Twitter Media Studio,1350,4744,corona; 
Democrats’ latest spin: They’ve moved from a $3.5 trillion far-left non-COVID-related wish list to a $2.5 trillion far-left non-COVID-related wish list and insist the White House meet them there.  That’s not a reality-based negotiation. It’s throwing spaghetti at the wall. https://t.co/QmHTA0WdMu,2020-08-13 18:38:24,Twitter Media Studio,1245,3360,covid; 
The PPP saved Main Street jobs across Kentucky. It sent more than $5B in payroll support to our state. But the recovery is not finished. Hard-hit businesses need a second draw and Republicans proposed one.  But Democrats are blocking it over non-COVID-related wish-list items.,2020-08-12 17:41:42,Twitter Web App,2155,5912,covid; 
Americans need relief and that means focusing on what’s directly related to COVID-19: Kids jobs healthcare and legal protections for re-opening.

The Speaker &amp; Democratic Leader say not another dime for testing treatments or vaccines unless they get a huge tax cut for blue-state millionaires.

The Speaker and the Democratic Leader say they won’t allow another cent for families schools or the PPP unless they get a trillion-dollar state government slush fund way beyond COVID needs.

The New York Times proclaims Democrats are “Playing Hardball on Coronavirus Relief.”   “Playing” is right — they’re treating this like a political game.   Families are suffering. Americans are dying. This isn’t a game it’s a crisis. Our country needs Democrats to act like it.,2020-08-11 15:35:35,Twitter for iPhone,3720,9453,corona; 
Because of Democrats’ obstruction the extra federal unemployment aid expired. The PPP is closed with no second round in sight. No new money for testing or schools. No second round of checks to families. Democrats held all this hostage for non-COVID-related liberal priorities.,2020-08-10 21:13:18,Twitter Web App,6463,15336,covid;

Speaker Pelosi is still holding up this entire package over bizarre unrelated things like carveouts for the marijuana industry. She even claimed to the press that pot is a proven COVID-19 therapy!
