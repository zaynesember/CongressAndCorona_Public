While far from perfect the bipartisan #coronavirus bill will ensure all Americans have access to testing while also providing a stronger temporary social safety net for those who are sick or caring for ill loved ones. ➡️https://t.co/2Xjmbb4FNq,2020-03-19 00:42:42,TweetDeck,1,3,corona; 
The #COVID19 outbreak in addition to the clear health risks has unleashed a great deal of disruption and anxiety into all aspects of our lives. Today the Senate unanimously passed the Families First #Coronavirus Response Act. https://t.co/ioJg8gveYj,2020-03-19 00:40:17,Twitter Media Studio,2,14,covid; corona; 
Here’s an update on what I’m working on in D.C. to help Alaskans through the health and economic challenges we are currently facing with the #COVID19 #coronavirus pandemic. https://t.co/rmuWl7ULjB https://t.co/kfnwgdvQMg,2020-03-18 00:14:59,Twitter Media Studio,2,3,covid; corona; 
Good advice from Alaska’s former Chief Medical Officer Dr. Jay Butler (now at @CDCgov) for our elders and Americans with underlying medical conditions on how to prevent being exposed to #COVID19. https://t.co/OgyOk8YlJi,2020-03-16 21:57:45,Twitter Web App,6,10,covid; 
I also want to encourage Alaskans to stay safe and follow current @CDCgov #coronavirus guidance which you can find on my website at https://t.co/QBM19uv8tv. Working together we will get through the serious challenges facing our state and country. Stay well.,2020-03-13 18:29:02,TweetDeck,2,4,corona; 
My staff and I will remain highly involved in these legislative efforts. We’re also in regular contact with our state health officials and elected officials standing by to give them the assistance needed in containing and treating the #coronavirus.,2020-03-13 18:28:19,TweetDeck,1,4,corona; 
In D.C. we’re working to ensure Alaska has the tools necessary for #coronavirus prevention &amp; treatment. Last week we passed an $8.3 billion emergency funding package that allocates money to state local &amp; tribal health providers. These funds are already coming to Alaska.,2020-03-13 18:27:04,TweetDeck,2,2,corona; 
Much has changed in our country in the last few weeks and it’s an uncertain time for many of us. But one thing is clear: Alaskans are the most resilient people anywhere and working together we can limit the spread and lessen the impact of this #coronavirus.,2020-03-13 18:26:35,TweetDeck,2,22,corona; 
I joined Rebecca Palsha on @Ch2KTUU recently for an extended interview about the COVID-19 #coronavirus and how the federal government is working with states and local communities to prepare. https://t.co/vBWafADneB,2020-03-03 02:19:31,Twitter Media Studio,2,10,covid; corona; 
@CDCgov @DHSgov @StateDept @lisamurkowski @FAANews Finally to stay up-to-date with the most current information and resources available I encourage Alaskans to visit the @CDCgov site dedicated to the #coronavirus at:  https://t.co/RdZOZH1Ipg [11/11],2020-02-26 16:35:48,Twitter Web App,2,4,corona; 
@CDCgov @DHSgov @StateDept @lisamurkowski @FAANews In a briefing I received yesterday morning I pressed senior Trump administration officials again on closing this Chinese-based cargo air crew loophole. #coronavirus [10/11],2020-02-26 16:34:33,Twitter Web App,2,3,corona; 
@CDCgov @DHSgov @StateDept @lisamurkowski We must be vigilant while ensuring vital medical supplies from abroad reach Americans in need. However I believe that fed. efforts on foreign-based air cargo crews need to be tightened for the safety of Americans particularly in cargo-hub states like Alaska. #coronavirus [8/11],2020-02-26 16:32:42,Twitter Web App,2,2,corona; 
@CDCgov @DHSgov @StateDept @lisamurkowski Second as an international air cargo hub Anchorage plays an important role in the global supply chain — which includes critical medical supplies to help in domestic preparedness efforts. #coronavirus [7/11],2020-02-26 16:31:58,Twitter Web App,1,2,corona; 
@CDCgov @DHSgov @StateDept @lisamurkowski A few additional points: First according to @CDCgov across the globe many more people have died from the flu this season than from the #coronavirus. However the coronavirus appears more contagious than the flu likely spreading when a patient is not symptomatic. [6/11],2020-02-26 16:31:15,Twitter Web App,5,10,corona; 
@CDCgov @DHSgov @StateDept @lisamurkowski In this regard I have pressed the administration for additional funds to increase prevention efforts and to ensure preparedness at the state and local levels. #coronavirus [5/11],2020-02-26 16:30:16,Twitter Web App,2,1,corona; 
@CDCgov @DHSgov @StateDept The government is focused on continuing its international containment efforts as well as significantly ramping up efforts to support state &amp; local authorities as they expand their preparedness response if and when #coronavirus hits the U.S. in larger numbers. [3/11],2020-02-26 16:26:20,Twitter Web App,2,2,corona; 
@CDCgov @DHSgov @StateDept Given how the virus is spreading internationally I was advised that we will likely see the #coronavirus hit the U.S. in greater numbers over the coming weeks and months. And while Alaska is far removed from the rest of the Lower 48 we are unlikely to remain an island. [2/11],2020-02-26 16:25:27,Twitter Web App,3,1,corona; 
Yesterday I received a briefing from top @CDCgov @DHSgov &amp; @StateDept officials on the U.S. response to the COVID-19 #coronavirus. Up to this point the federal government has been focused on containing the virus from entering the U.S. thru int'l quarantine efforts. [1/11],2020-02-26 16:24:49,Twitter Web App,2,8,covid; corona; 
These patriotic individuals did their jobs admirably and no doubt provided a level of comfort to their fellow citizens embroiled in an unsettling situation. #coronavirus,2020-02-04 15:38:58,TweetDeck,2,5,corona; 
I want to commend the numerous Alaskans including medical professions and first responders who offered help last week for the American evacuees from Wuhan who stopped over at the Anchorage airport on their journey to the Lower 48. #coronavirus,2020-02-04 15:38:31,TweetDeck,2,4,corona; 
To address one particular question I’ve received: All upcoming cargo flights between Wuhan and Alaska have been canceled and many commercial airlines have suspended passenger flights between the U.S. and China. #coronavirus,2020-02-04 15:37:37,TweetDeck,2,2,corona; 
@SecAzar Last week Secretary Azar declared a public health emergency. @WHO has classified the outbreak as a global health emergency. @StateDept has issued an alert advising Americans to not travel to China. #coronavirus,2020-02-04 15:37:05,TweetDeck,2,3,corona; 
As we see the number of cases of the novel coronavirus increase I encourage Alaskans to remain calm but very vigilant. Health &amp; Human Services @SecAzar recently said “The risk to Americans remains low and we are working to keep it that way.” https://t.co/vk2I87socr,2020-02-04 15:34:46,Twitter Web App,5,9,corona; 
Many Alaskans have reached out in recent days with concerns about the reported cases in the U.S. of a new coronavirus which are all connected back to Wuhan China. I just attended a briefing with senior federal health officials including from the @CDCgov about the situation. https://t.co/ddS1h7qgWP,2020-01-24 20:32:47,Twitter Media Studio,9,21,corona;
