Remember there is still much to be hopeful for. A number of promising COVID-19 vaccine candidates. A president-elect who has not just the experience to lead our country but the empathy and integrity to go with it (7/10),2020-11-25 17:03:13,Twitter Web App,2,36,covid; 
Nearly one quarter of American households have experienced food insecurity this year. Senate Republicans: You are failing the American people. Tell Mitch McConnell to pass a comprehensive coronavirus relief package now. https://t.co/DqHMAEqKim,2020-11-23 18:38:13,Twitter for iPhone,476,2398,corona; 
American families need relief NOW. And if Mitch McConnell were serious about passing COVID relief he wouldn’t throw poison pills—like blanket liability protections for businesses that don’t take the lives of their workers seriously—into legislation.  https://t.co/6BCzzblhGD,2020-11-21 21:01:45,Twitter Web App,112,560,covid; 
Our country is seeing 130000 new cases everyday and more than 238000 Americans have died. But rather than work with Democrats to pass a COVID relief package Senator McConnell is focused on coddling President Trump's ego.   Enough is enough. Stop the games. Do your job. https://t.co/gddck5HLmN,2020-11-10 17:04:48,Twitter for iPhone,288,1379,covid; 
Our first and most important priority is COVID relief.   President-Elect Biden is already taking important steps to try to contain this pandemic—and I stand ready in the Senate to write any legislation to help move the right solutions forward. https://t.co/QhjMhpZetk,2020-11-09 22:30:00,Twitter Web App,47,388,covid; 
My Republican colleagues in the Senate need to get their priorities straight and start rushing to get people COVID relief instead of rushing to take health care away from millions of people at the moment they need it most.,2020-10-15 20:30:00,Twitter Web App,235,1481,covid; 
Right now Congress is pushing trillions of dollars of COVID relief out the door. And millions are going right into the pockets of the same people making decisions about relief policy. @katieporteroc and I want to put a stop to this. https://t.co/jSjGvhSJvq,2020-09-24 14:00:03,Twitter Media Studio,76,246,covid; 
Did you know that millions of dollars of COVID relief money went right into the pockets of the same members of Congress who passed it?    @katieporteroc and I are announcing new legislation to end this kind of government abuse: The STOCK Act 2.0   Sign on: https://t.co/OIXd3czADK https://t.co/b4G1hZBESV,2020-09-23 12:45:00,Twitter Media Studio,655,1396,covid; 
We just crossed 200000 COVID deaths. And millions of families are struggling to keep food on the table and pay rent.   But right now Trump is abusing his power to distract the American people from these issues.   We need to vote him out.  https://t.co/JOAbmeQl8u,2020-09-22 18:51:09,Twitter for iPhone,36,160,covid; 
As much as President Trump and many Republicans want to pretend that COVID has magically gone away it hasn’t.  To act like it has is an affront to the lives lost and the millions of families who have been affected.  It’s also a recipe for disaster.,2020-09-10 13:29:27,Twitter Web App,112,501,covid; 
Nearly 30 million people are out of work.  Tens of thousands are contracting COVID each day.  Millions are struggling to pay rent and keep food on the table.  But instead of addressing these needs McConnell has put out a relief bill that prioritizes the needs of corporations.,2020-09-09 22:10:21,Twitter for iPhone,321,897,covid; 
This #LaborDay I’m thinking of the essential workers who remain at the frontlines of our country’s response to the COVID crisis. They deserve meaningful protections from Congress—including premium compensation paid sick and family leave and health and safety protections.,2020-09-07 20:55:59,Twitter for iPhone,64,368,covid; 
Betsy DeVos wants to fully reopen schools without any concrete plan to do so safely despite the rising number of COVID-19 cases across the country.   This is inept leadership at best malfeasance at worst. https://t.co/mvmcyid9Ec,2020-07-13 18:00:26,Twitter for iPhone,174,681,covid; 
We’re seeing a resurgence in COVID19 spread across the country as people stop practicing social distancing and stop wearing masks.   Each of us has a duty to protect others.   Take precaution and wear a mask. https://t.co/OGKJF4qdy2,2020-07-06 22:02:00,Twitter Web App,69,268,covid; 
The COVID-19 crisis has left state and local governments facing rising costs and plummeting revenues. If the Senate doesn’t act soon to help things stand to get very bad very soon. It’s time to get back to work and give them direct federal relief.,2020-07-03 18:06:41,Twitter Web App,67,428,covid; 
Over 1.7 million cases of COVID-19 in the country.   Over 100000 dead.   Now Trump is further undermining our leadership and putting the American people at risk by severing ties with the @WHO the organization coordinating international response and drug trials. https://t.co/q1PpSPpb2U,2020-05-30 00:10:45,Twitter for iPhone,84,393,covid; 
The country is rapidly approaching 100000 deaths due to COVID-19. Millions are out of work.   Americans need more relief but why does McConnell have the Senate back in session? To confirm Trump’s far-right judicial nominees.   We deserve better. https://t.co/Q3uSw31SHh https://t.co/tHfrSOuhag,2020-05-20 22:30:00,Twitter Media Studio,91,247,covid; 
Our first responders are serving on the front lines of this pandemic risking their health to keep us safe.

More than 30 million Americans have lost their jobs in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. We need to ensure that they not only return to the workplace but that the workplace they return to offers them more opportunity and stability.

If we want to safely re-open our country we need to strengthen our nation’s public health system and our testing and contact-tracing capacity. That’s why I introduced legislation to build a Health Force to recruit Americans for jobs at the frontlines of the coronavirus crisis.,2020-05-13 20:11:34,Twitter for iPhone,71,398,corona;

At this moment nurses are hard at work providing critical health care on the front lines of this COVID crisis. Make sure to thank them today and remember that our gratitude isn't enough—we must keep speaking out for the protections PPE and pay they deserve. #NationalNursesDay,2020-05-06 18:25:26,Twitter for iPhone,27,148,covid; 
Numerous experts have said that our country’s testing capacity is inadequate and far from what is needed to contain the coronavirus outbreak. It’s time for real leadership from President Trump. The health of our nation depends on a comprehensive national testing strategy.,2020-05-06 13:01:40,Twitter for iPhone,159,1006,corona;

With the USPS facing the twin threats of the COVID-19 pandemic and a president who wants to hasten its demise we must put all our effort toward strengthening this American institution.  My solution?

Mitch McConnell just told states suffering from the coronavirus pandemic that they should go bankrupt.   That's not the kind of leadership we deserve.   It's time to retire Mitch and send @AmyMcGrathKY to the Senate. The stakes couldn't be higher:   https://t.co/XEOtm4DhsX,2020-04-24 00:07:18,Twitter Web App,332,1135,corona;

Even before this public health crisis fewer than 20% of American workers had access to paid leave. By making it available to every American worker we can alleviate fears care for working families and help slow the spread of coronavirus.,2020-04-18 13:31:56,Twitter for iPhone,127,880,corona; 
The end to the COVID-19 crisis is still months away but it’s clear that in the aftermath it will call for bold transformational legislation: America’s first universal paid family and medical leave policy. I share more in @TIME: https://t.co/nvza0pwl3S,2020-04-16 13:53:26,TweetDeck,243,1612,covid;

Capt. Crozier was trying to protect his command from coronavirus. He was fulfilling his duty.

I voted against advancing the Senate Republican #COVID19 stimulus plan. It's a shameful piece of legislation. In the midst of this unprecedented crisis we have to ensure that this package is fair and equitable—and I will keep fighting to do that.,2020-03-22 22:51:57,TweetDeck,1898,13467,covid; 
Sen. McConnell is using what should be a moment of bipartisan leadership to pay back his campaign donors with a corporate slush fund with no transparency or accountability. As it stands his #COVID19 stimulus plan makes the 2008 bank bailout look responsible. It’s so bad.,2020-03-22 20:15:41,Twitter Web App,1251,4000,covid; 
Today every Senate Dem supported the PAID Leave Act—my bill with @PattyMurray to give emergency paid family and sick leave to every worker—as an amendment to the coronavirus relief package. The House majority supports this too. This is a must include provision moving forward.,2020-03-18 20:12:36,TweetDeck,99,644,corona; 
To fight this crisis we must slow the spread of the coronavirus. That means providing paid sick days and paid family leave to every American worker now. No exceptions or carve outs—especially not for the wealthiest companies in the world.,2020-03-18 14:48:27,TweetDeck,182,1112,corona; 
The #COVID19 outbreak has made clear again that we must do more to support our working families.

I want to remind everyone that the best way to help slow the spread of #COVID19 is to stay home (if you’re able) and to practice social distancing as much as possible—even if you’re healthy or not showing symptoms.

Imagine how different this #COVID19 crisis would be if every single worker knew they could care themselves or a loved one if they’re sick. Paid family and sick leave would certainly give our workforce the calm and confidence needed to get through this. So why not get it done?,2020-03-13 15:59:02,Twitter Web App,164,1238,covid; 
For the safety and well-being of our families communities and economy as we address the #COVID19 outbreak Congress must pass paid sick leave for every American worker.,2020-03-12 14:32:47,Twitter for iPhone,218,1215,covid;
