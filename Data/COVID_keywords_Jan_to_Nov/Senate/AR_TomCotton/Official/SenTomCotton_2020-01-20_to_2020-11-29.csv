I simply said we couldn't rule out any possibility yet for the virus' origin including a laboratory accident. https://t.co/e0N9uMCPZg,2020-02-18 23:47:29,Twitter for iPhone,799,2111,corona; 
WaPo’s own expert said he could not rule out that the virus' spread was the result of a "lab incident” and acknowledged the lab had similar types of coronavirus on hand.  @washingtonpost should retract or risk furthering their descent into fake news.  https://t.co/e1hejJniXb,2020-02-18 22:30:25,Twitter Web App,324,847,corona;

I haven’t said the coronavirus is “a Chinese bioweapon run amok” so I haven’t “walked back” anything. What I have said is that China’s official origin story of the Wuhan food market is almost certainly bogus.,2020-02-17 14:34:12,Twitter for iPhone,352,1181,corona; 
Let me debunk the debunkers. @paulina_milla and her “experts” wrongly jump straight to the claim that the coronavirus is an engineered bioweapon. That’s not what I’ve said. There’s at least four hypotheses about the origin of the virus: https://t.co/536ygN1gC7,2020-02-17 00:33:20,Twitter for iPhone,808,1808,corona; 
Because of the CCP’s lies we don’t know where this coronavirus originated though we do almost certainly know it wasn’t in the Wuhan food market.,2020-02-16 23:43:18,Twitter for iPhone,486,1545,corona; 
.@jaketapper This unnamed “expert” says it’s “possible” that coronavirus originated in Wuhan super lab we “just don’t know how probable.” I agree. Yet he calls it a “conspiracy theory” that we shouldn’t “mention.” I couldn’t disagree more. He’s wrong on two counts. https://t.co/o5fGkkTu2u,2020-02-16 23:43:17,Twitter for iPhone,2186,5324,corona;

Yesterday marked the largest one-day increase in the Wuhan coronavirus’s spread—14840 new cases in Hubei province alone.   And that’s just what the Chinese Communist Party decided to release—as I’ve said for weeks the true numbers are much higher. https://t.co/LTs93yqLSs,2020-02-13 16:04:18,Twitter Web App,1070,1723,corona; 
Wuhan coronavirus spread so widely because the Chinese Communist Party covered it up &amp; silenced whistleblowers like Dr. Li. Firing local officials won’t make a difference—the party itself &amp; the system of fear and oppression it has created is the problem. https://t.co/GkunnHmNhb,2020-02-13 16:00:52,Twitter Web App,1398,2622,corona;

Dr. Li tried to protect his country &amp; the world from the coronavirus but was silenced by the Chinese Communist Party. Now they have his blood on their hands.
