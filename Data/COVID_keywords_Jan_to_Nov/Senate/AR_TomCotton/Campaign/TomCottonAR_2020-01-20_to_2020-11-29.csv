One of Biden's Covid advisors thinks life isn't worth living past the age of 75.   Another wants to lock down the entire nation for 4 to 6 weeks.   Horrible idea. https://t.co/pqJLVThysX,2020-11-11 22:23:20,Twitter Web App,422,1470,covid; 
A member of Biden’s new coronavirus task force is a lockdown enthusiast who has written that living past 75 isn’t worth it.  Americans want our country opened up not creepy bioethicists who enjoy playing God. https://t.co/5NnFm4u7u1,2020-11-09 13:12:52,Twitter for iPhone,1453,3212,corona; 
Democratic governors encouraged—and often participated in—mass protests that didn't follow their own social distance guidelines.   How can they continue to discriminate against churches trying to safely reopen?,2020-06-09 14:03:58,Twitter Web App,276,1152,social distance; 
Liberals in Illinois wrecked the state's finances long before the China Virus—now they pass budgets that raise their own pay while anticipating billions in taxpayer bailouts.   Recklessness and arrogance.   https://t.co/2V6qpu7MW9,2020-05-26 16:31:00,Twitter Web App,237,375,china virus; 
It's understandable why the murderous Chinese Communist Party doesn't want the Wuhan virus to be linked to China.   But it's mind-boggling that Senate Democrats are participating in China's propaganda.,2020-05-21 16:23:11,Twitter Web App,59,158,wuhan virus; 
Will Senate Democrats condemn CNN for saying "Wuhan Coronavirus"? https://t.co/0vZ3NDi7mf,2020-05-21 16:23:10,Twitter Web App,4,38,corona; 
Senate Dems want to pass a resolution condemning the term "Wuhan virus".   But term was widely used even by the liberal media until the CCP started started pretending the virus came from the U.S.   Why are Dems helping the CCP push propaganda through Senate resolutions? https://t.co/i4zUOL0MHw,2020-05-21 16:23:10,Twitter Web App,101,296,wuhan virus; 
Since I first learned of the Wuhan coronavirus in mid-January common sense has been my guide. Not Chinese communist lies. Not “the models.” Not so-called “public-health experts.” Just common sense. Many elected leaders have also been guided by common sense. Others haven’t.,2020-04-11 18:38:21,Twitter for iPhone,863,2548,corona; 
China's lies helped spread the Wuhan coronavirus.   China is our biggest long-term threat.  @JoeBiden has been weak on China his whole career.   This campaign Joe needs to answer for failing to stand up to China. https://t.co/pQGmdSotKB,2020-03-12 17:37:38,Twitter Web App,9502,20067,corona;

China is a growing threat and China's duplicity helped spread the Wuhan coronavirus.   @JoeBiden has been weak on China his whole career.   Biden supported bad trade deals claimed China is "not competition" and can't be trusted to take on China.  https://t.co/H5BmIg9sd4,2020-03-11 18:14:35,Twitter Web App,367,573,corona;
