Mohamad Amashah a med student from NJ who was arrested at a protest in #Egypt last year is one of many Americans &amp; political prisoners locked up abroad on baseless charges—now in jails especially vulnerable to #COVID19.

In 2019 700000+ New Jerseyans relied on SNAP. As the #COVID19 crisis continues causing record unemployment more families in NJ &amp; around the US will need this vital program.

Ways to slow virus spread like washing hands &amp; practicing social distancing are nearly impossible in jail. More prisons will become hot spots for #COVID19 if we don’t act.

It's a tragic failure of our broken criminal justice system that in the wealthiest country in the world we criminalize poverty like this. With #COVID19 rapidly spreading in our jails it's now a matter of life &amp; death for so many who shouldn't be behind bars in the first place. https://t.co/aDv5tDT6zG,2020-04-20 18:40:59,Twitter Web App,17,50,covid; 
More cases of #COVID19 are showing up at immigrant detention centers putting others at grave risk.

In just 3 weeks 17 million people have filed for unemployment. This doesn’t even include everyone who's been unable to file. 1 in 10 American workers is out of a job.

This is tragic. A nonviolent drug charge shouldn't become a death sentence.

For weeks we’ve been calling for a special enrollment period so uninsured Americans can get affordable quality health care as we fight #COVID19.

Incarcerated people with underlying health issues are at particular risk from #COVID19—confinement makes social distancing virtually impossible.

As #COVID19 spreads it’s critical that DHS ICE &amp; CBP protect those who are in their custody especially the most vulnerable immigrant populations.

10 years ago the #AffordableCareAct became law providing health care for over 20 million Americans &amp; protecting 135 million with preexisting conditions.

Americans who lack paid sick days: 70% of the lowest income workers 81% of food service industry workers 75% of child care center workers  Access to health care for low income people &amp; for people of color is already a public health crisis—the spread of #COVID19 is a disaster.,2020-03-13 14:41:31,Twitter Web App,102,216,covid; 
One of the most effective ways to fight #COVID19 is staying home from work or school when you're sick. But for millions of Americans that’s not an option—because we're the only wealthy nation in the world that doesn’t guarantee paid sick &amp; family leave for workers.,2020-03-13 00:11:17,Twitter Web App,235,1016,covid; 
Paid sick &amp; family leave is a public health &amp; safety issue—it’s about economic justice &amp; it’s about our economic strength &amp; security.  As we fight #COVID19 we need to do the things that keep our communities &amp; our economy healthy—that means passing paid sick &amp; family leave.,2020-03-12 19:45:00,Twitter Web App,42,234,covid; 
I’m talking about the urgency of passing paid sick and family leave to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic with my colleagues @gillibrandny and @SenKamalaHarris.   Tune in here: https://t.co/92Hr9sciWE,2020-03-12 17:17:59,Twitter Media Studio,78,587,covid;

We’ve received many troubling reports of people not being screened for #COVID19 at US airports despite traveling from countries with high confirmed cases of #coronavirus. @SenatorMenendez &amp; I are demanding answers from the Trump Admin so we can minimize the spread of the virus. https://t.co/OC5hp2mLod,2020-03-11 18:58:46,Twitter Web App,42,176,covid; corona; 
Too many Americans can’t afford to stay home if they are sick—so they show up to work &amp; risk passing along their illness to coworkers &amp; the public at large.  With #coronavirus an urgent public threat—we need paid sick leave now to protect workers &amp; their families.,2020-03-11 17:48:14,Twitter Web App,398,1313,corona; 
Stopping the spread of #coronavirus isn’t just about protecting yourself it’s about protecting your family neighbors and so many vulnerable populations. https://t.co/OaJ4OutDAU,2020-03-11 15:10:15,Twitter Web App,35,111,corona;

Deeply saddened by this tragic loss of life—my thoughts are with his loved ones.  While NJ leadership is working hard to protect New Jerseyans from #COVID19 we all must do our part &amp; take necessary precautions to stop this deadly illness from spreading: https://t.co/DXyxyiqLYT https://t.co/g1g4NRM4WT,2020-03-10 18:19:46,Twitter Web App,17,74,covid;

I joined many of my @SenateDems colleagues to call on @DHSgov to stop immigration enforcement at hospitals &amp; medical facilities while #coronavirus continues to spread. People in this country should feel safe to seek medical care without fear of being deported. https://t.co/e9tLXOZDKP,2020-03-06 15:36:22,Twitter Web App,45,134,corona; 
Grateful that Congress came together to pass much-needed funding to combat coronavirus.  With the 1st probable case in NJ this funding is critical to those on the frontlines dealing with this threat—glad that funding I requested for state &amp; local health departments is included. https://t.co/wtBwjXbdHr,2020-03-05 22:38:48,Twitter Web App,20,123,corona; 
Over the weekend it was reported that roughly 2 million tweets spread conspiracy theories about the coronavirus in a coordinated effort. The objective is to muddle the facts and prey on vulnerable people. We need to know who is doing it and how we can stop it. https://t.co/PmIqtk7YgW,2020-03-05 15:19:19,Twitter Web App,77,182,corona; 
Even as coronavirus spreads Republicans are still trying to take away Americans' health care. If SCOTUS rules to overturn the ACA then 20 million Americans will lose coverage &amp; 130 million Americans with preexisting conditions will lose protections. So much is at stake. https://t.co/eSMdt8FQ5f,2020-03-02 15:47:00,Twitter Web App,301,460,corona; 
Telling Americans to turn off the news about coronavirus in order to deal with what the CDC described as an inevitable spread is dangerous. Now more than ever people must be informed how they can protect themselves and their family. https://t.co/iwtaKkq0t0,2020-02-28 21:24:31,Twitter Web App,78,197,corona; 
Trump has yet to take coronavirus seriously—from his inadequate funding request to his budget proposal that cuts the CDC. In today's press conference he repeatedly contradicted CDC &amp; NIH medical experts. This public health threat demands leadership.,2020-02-27 03:40:39,Twitter Web App,74,354,corona; 
Trump’s response to Coronavirus is dangerously inadequate. We need a whole-of-government response to take on this growing public health emergency—we can't afford to let it spread and risk massive economic &amp; health consequences. https://t.co/Gz7Et4zfv6,2020-02-25 19:39:27,Twitter Web App,52,145,corona;
