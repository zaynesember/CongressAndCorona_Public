We’ve lost 30 New Jersey first responders to COVID-19.   We can never repay them for their heroism and sacrifice but at very least their families must receive the benefits they deserve.

Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee are currently sick with COVID-19. It is not safe to rush through a Supreme Court nominee and risk further spread of the virus.  These confirmation hearings must be postponed.  https://t.co/uESQe79iXB,2020-10-08 18:29:35,Twitter Web App,443,2106,covid; 
Instead of rushing through a Supreme Court nominee Mitch McConnell should hurry up and finally let us pass a COVID-19 relief package.  Countless American families are facing eviction and struggling to put food on the table.  They need our help.,2020-10-01 15:07:01,Twitter Web App,2899,13266,covid; 
Fortunately we've been able to significantly reduce the spread of COVID-19 here in New Jersey. But we must remain vigilant and keep listening to the experts like Dr. Fauci. Social distancing and mask wearing are still essential. https://t.co/bG1BUeObXa,2020-09-26 17:48:15,Twitter Web App,215,1289,covid; 
@LindaNe53652169 @brianschatz Thank you for your concern Linda. I love New Jersey and one of the best things I can do is get Mitch McConnel out of the majority so we can pass a Covid relief package for my state and our nation.

The legacy of racial inequality—higher poverty rates poor access to health care housing discrimination—has left Black communities particularly vulnerable to COVID-19.

There are people being held in jail now who haven't even been convicted of a crime—yet find themselves endangered by the spread of COVID-19 simply because they can't afford to post bail.
