I’ve always worked with anyone on both sides of the aisle to get things done for Iowa-it’s why I’m ranked one of the most bipartisan Senators of the last 25 yrs   It’s also why it’s so frustrating that @GreenfieldIowa’s liberal allies refuse to come to the table on COVID relief,2020-10-22 21:26:34,TweetDeck,42,170,covid; 
.@GreenfieldIowa's Senate allies just blocked:  $105 billion for students and education  $47 billion for COVID testing and vaccine development  $20 billion for farmers  $15 billion for childcare  To try to help their election chances. This is partisan politics at its worst.,2020-10-21 19:58:36,TweetDeck,58,159,covid;

The Senate GOP put forward a COVID relief bill that would provide:   Expanded unemployment benefits💸   PPP for small biz💼   School funding👩‍🏫   Help with childcare👨‍👩‍👧   Support for farmers🌽   Senate Dems blocked it   We need to end the games and get people the help they need,2020-10-14 21:09:18,TweetDeck,210,529,covid;

When her liberal allies moved to cut out COVID aid for our farmers @GreenfieldIowa didn’t say a word. I’m not surprised she’s bought and paid for by @chuckschumer and liberal special interest groups. She’s already putting them before Iowa.,2020-09-23 23:13:46,TweetDeck,50,141,covid; 
The liberals bankrolling @GreenfieldIowa are blocking aid to our farmers playing politics instead of helping hardworking Iowans hurting from the effects of #COVID19 and the Derecho.
