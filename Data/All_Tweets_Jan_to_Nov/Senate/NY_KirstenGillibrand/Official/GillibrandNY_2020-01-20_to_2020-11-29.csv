I am deeply saddened to hear of Richard Hanna's passing. He was a true public servant who worked to further our shared values and do the right thing often setting aside partisan politics in the process.

Our workers shouldn't be forced to make the impossible choice between a paycheck and caring for themselves or a loved one. Sadly many must make that choice.   Right now we have the chance to do the right thing and pass paid sick leave and family leave. Let's get it done. https://t.co/XIgfB0LH88,2020-03-13 21:30:00,TweetDeck,13,34
If we had national paid sick days and paid family leave every American worker could have the peace of mind that they would be able to care for themselves or a loved one during this public health crisis. #COVID19 https://t.co/hhr1fok7Rb,2020-03-12 20:15:00,TweetDeck,35,97
With the #COVID19 outbreak many American workers will choose between a paycheck and caring for themselves or a loved one. As the Senate considers an economic relief bill @SenKamalaHarris @SenBooker and I are calling to include paid family &amp; sick leave. https://t.co/S0QJ1jGMqm,2020-03-12 17:21:12,Twitter Web App,187,892
Every worker should have two weeks of paid sick leave. It's the right thing to do for our communities and for our economy especially as the country grapples with this #COVID19 outbreak.    https://t.co/BcQDVNbxzD,2020-03-11 20:42:22,Twitter Web App,15,65
Offering paid sick leave to every American worker would allow them to care for themselves and their families during this #COVID19 outbreak.   It would help keep our communities safe. https://t.co/1UzxmpK1Dx,2020-03-10 22:55:04,Twitter for iPhone,423,1517
Betsy DeVos' new borrower defense rule is a giveaway to her friends in the for-profit college industry at the expense of defrauded students and veterans. I urge my Senate colleagues to put #StudentsFirst and vote to overturn DeVos' disastrous new rule.,2020-03-10 17:23:01,TweetDeck,12,29

I spent time in Utica and Buffalo to roll out the End Outsourcing Act legislation that would protect jobs in New York and across the country by ensuring that federal policies only reward companies that invest in the United States. https://t.co/84wlF1oKT9,2020-03-07 01:37:18,Twitter for iPhone,5,33
It’s time to fix the broken political system that blocks progress on so many of the issues that Americans care about. Almost a year ago the House passed the #ForThePeople Act to do just that.

When a person seeks treatment for substance use disorder it can be very hard for their family.

Americans' data can be extremely valuable to many companies with unknown motives who might want to exploit it for profit. You should be able to go to an authority that will look out for your data privacy. That's why I want to start a Data Protection Agency. https://t.co/ZWpimCZ9Bm,2020-02-13 22:02:50,TweetDeck,5,30

I’m horrified by the attacks that took place in the Bronx.

Once again the Trump administration is misusing the federal government for political retribution. There is no factual basis for this policy—its true design is to punish New York. https://t.co/7DwtVhVdGE,2020-02-06 17:00:21,Twitter for iPhone,31,56

President Trump's misdeeds have posed a moral challenge to every single member of Congress. And those who lack courage in this moment—who are unwilling to do what they know in their heart of hearts to be right—will be remembered as complicit. https://t.co/TnDPWIGvch,2020-02-04 00:30:56,Twitter for iPhone,10,37
My statement on the Republican vote to block witnesses and relevant documents in the impeachment trial of President Trump: https://t.co/SXIAxVMrqH,2020-01-31 22:55:43,TweetDeck,90,302
With @SenBrianSchatz and @Sen_JoeManchin I asked:   Have you ever been involved in any trial—civil criminal or other—in which you were unable to call witnesses or submit relevant evidence?   The president's legal counsel obfuscated but the obvious answer was no. https://t.co/BGFT6mmu4C,2020-01-30 23:04:13,Twitter Web App,7,24
The Trump administration just announced a horrible plan to gut Medicaid their latest attempt to restrict access to affordable health care.

I asked the House Managers of this impeachment trial: How did President Trump’s freeze on aid to the Ukraine differ from previous holds on foreign assistance?  The answer was clear: He froze the aid to help himself—not our country. https://t.co/QKfpf1A3Ww,2020-01-30 04:25:40,Twitter for iPhone,15,39
The Senate and the American people deserve to hear from ALL relevant witnesses—and see all of the relevant evidence—at President Trump’s trial. Anything less is a cover-up. https://t.co/fzTUxFci7h,2020-01-29 16:38:00,Twitter Media Studio,74,260
Voters want comprehensive national #paidleave. And across party lines they prefer the #FAMILYAct model and overwhelmingly reject plans that would cut Social Security. https://t.co/ziRlYjSRIK,2020-01-28 21:01:28,TweetDeck,15,32
The #FAMILYAct is the BEST proposal to get paid leave to every American worker—regardless of circumstance—for the cost of a cup of coffee a week. https://t.co/qHL61dV39i,2020-01-28 17:21:24,TweetDeck,7,24
I’m very glad that @WaysMeansCmte is taking the time to discuss paid leave proposals today—and glad that @rosadelauro spoke on our behalf for the #FAMILYAct the most comprehensive proposal for real paid leave for all of life’s caregiving needs.

New York shouldn’t be penalized for helping its rural communities get online and this proposal will only make it harder for rural residents to do just that. I’m calling on the @FCC to immediately abandon this proposal. https://t.co/OAn16b8se8,2020-01-27 20:15:49,Twitter for iPhone,12,34
