Sending love and strength this Thanksgiving week (10/10),2020-11-25 17:03:13,Twitter Web App,6,117
For now we have to remain careful and do our parts to keep ourselves and our communities safe. The pandemic is far from over and I promise I’m working hard in Congress to get American families the relief they so desperately need (9/10),2020-11-25 17:03:13,Twitter Web App,6,87
Perhaps most of all the promise of future Thanksgivings where we safely can gather with our friends and family once again (8/10),2020-11-25 17:03:13,Twitter Web App,0,34
Remember there is still much to be hopeful for. A number of promising COVID-19 vaccine candidates. A president-elect who has not just the experience to lead our country but the empathy and integrity to go with it (7/10),2020-11-25 17:03:13,Twitter Web App,2,35
4) Stay active. I try to take our dog Maple on a walk in the park near our house every morning. It helps me clear my mind before the day really begins (6/10),2020-11-25 17:03:12,Twitter Web App,0,30
3) Reach out to your loved ones—particularly the most vulnerable among us. Zoom fatigue is real—trust me I understand. But set aside time this week to call those loved ones who won’t be able to join you at the Thanksgiving table (5/10),2020-11-25 17:03:12,Twitter Web App,1,30
2) Take time to recharge. My son Henry and I have tried to squeeze in an episode of @SchittsCreek after dinner most nights. It’s hilarious warm loving inclusive and a perfect tonic for these times (4/10),2020-11-25 17:03:12,Twitter Web App,1,54

Thanksgiving looks different this year. Our country is hurting. We’ve suffered enormous loss and I know it can feel like there’s no end in sight. I wanted to share a few of the ways I’ve been taking care of myself and my family these days (1/10),2020-11-25 17:03:11,Twitter Web App,23,235

Nearly one quarter of American households have experienced food insecurity this year. Senate Republicans: You are failing the American people. Tell Mitch McConnell to pass a comprehensive coronavirus relief package now. https://t.co/DqHMAEqKim,2020-11-23 18:38:13,Twitter for iPhone,483,2415

American families need relief NOW. And if Mitch McConnell were serious about passing COVID relief he wouldn’t throw poison pills—like blanket liability protections for businesses that don’t take the lives of their workers seriously—into legislation.  https://t.co/6BCzzblhGD,2020-11-21 21:01:45,Twitter Web App,112,559

The election has been decided. @JoeBiden won. It's absolutely outrageous that President Trump refuses to concede and allow for a peaceful transfer of power. It's time to put the politics aside.    https://t.co/ecwph56Z5N,2020-11-11 00:43:04,Twitter Web App,161,1535
Today SCOTUS hears oral arguments in the Republican lawsuit to strike down the ACA. If successful millions of Americans would lose their health insurance in the middle of a pandemic.   It's cruel and senseless. We'll keep speaking out and fighting back. https://t.co/S47L4Wb6sC,2020-11-10 18:20:00,Twitter Web App,70,328
Our country is seeing 130000 new cases everyday and more than 238000 Americans have died. But rather than work with Democrats to pass a COVID relief package Senator McConnell is focused on coddling President Trump's ego.   Enough is enough. Stop the games. Do your job. https://t.co/gddck5HLmN,2020-11-10 17:04:48,Twitter for iPhone,288,1379
The truth is that @JoeBiden won the election. It's concerning that Republican leaders can't seem to say those words. The silence is deafening.   It's just more of what we've seen throughout Trump's entire presidency—Republican leaders unable to stand up and articulate the truth.,2020-11-10 00:04:15,Twitter Web App,1152,9459
Our first and most important priority is COVID relief.   President-Elect Biden is already taking important steps to try to contain this pandemic—and I stand ready in the Senate to write any legislation to help move the right solutions forward. https://t.co/QhjMhpZetk,2020-11-09 22:30:00,Twitter Web App,47,386

The largest burn pit on Balad Air Base in Iraq was 10 acres of burning garbage plastics and medical waste. It burned 24 hours a day 365 days a year from 2003 to 2009—next to where our service members ate slept and worked. 4/8,2020-09-14 12:32:42,Twitter for iPhone,22,70

The country is rapidly approaching 100000 deaths due to COVID-19. Millions are out of work.   Americans need more relief but why does McConnell have the Senate back in session?

Last week McConnell said he doesn't "feel the urgency of acting immediately" to consider new measures to help Americans during this pandemic.  Almost 90k lives have been lost.

And right now in the midst of a public health crisis more than 80% of American workers don’t have access to paid leave. It’s worse than unacceptable. It's terrible policy.,2020-03-16 13:35:43,TweetDeck,474,2305
I want to remind everyone that the best way to help slow the spread of #COVID19 is to stay home (if you’re able) and to practice social distancing as much as possible—even if you’re healthy or not showing symptoms.

I’m encouraged to hear that the economic relief package passed by the House last night will include two weeks of paid sick leave and three months of paid family leave. The Senate should follow suit immediately and pass these policies to help the workers who desperately need it.,2020-03-14 13:33:19,Twitter for iPhone,267,2049

Imagine how different this #COVID19 crisis would be if every single worker knew they could care themselves or a loved one if they’re sick. Paid family and sick leave would certainly give our workforce the calm and confidence needed to get through this. So why not get it done?,2020-03-13 15:59:02,Twitter Web App,164,1237
For the safety and well-being of our families communities and economy as we address the #COVID19 outbreak Congress must pass paid sick leave for every American worker.,2020-03-12 14:32:47,Twitter for iPhone,218,1214
We can trace much of Washington’s inaction on important problems to special interests big corporations and the very wealthy. And at the root of their power is the vast sums of money spent to stop reforms in their tracks.

As the most conservative Supreme Court in decades decides this case there’s a real chance that the majority will violate precedent and uphold Louisiana’s law effectively making Roe irrelevant.

Louisiana’s law is nearly identical to a Texas law that SCOTUS struck down in 2016.  What’s changed?   It's the first time the court has reviewed an abortion case since Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation. Take a look: https://t.co/m0dE6SOMTp,2020-03-04 13:34:14,Twitter Web App,88,284
The stakes could not be higher. If the Supreme Court allows this law to take effect all but one clinic in Louisiana would be forced to close leaving just one doctor to provide abortion care for the nearly one million residents who may need it.,2020-03-04 13:32:41,Twitter Web App,78,273
Louisiana's law required abortion providers to have “admitting privileges” at a hospital within 30 miles of where they practice effectively giving hospitals veto power over whether providers can continue to give care for any reason—including religious or ideological differences.,2020-03-04 13:31:56,Twitter Web App,57,258
Today the Supreme Court begins reviewing a restrictive anti-abortion law in Louisiana.

We were successful in our efforts to help 9/11 responders—and I have faith that we can help these vets too. https://t.co/PI7Cvj300P,2020-01-28 19:27:35,TweetDeck,49,398
We're the only industrialized nation that leaves workers to make the impossible choice between a paycheck and caring for their families. It's time to fix this.   Let's give American workers a paid family leave program for all of life's caregiving needs. Let's pass the #FAMILYAct.,2020-01-28 17:30:11,TweetDeck,70,443
The significance of Holocaust Remembrance Day has only grown with the rising scourge of anti-Semitism in our own communities and around the world. We mourn the millions of Jews and other victims killed by hate—and pledge to never forget and never let it happen again.,2020-01-27 14:19:52,Twitter for iPhone,77,516
John Bolton must testify before the Senate at this trial. No more excuses.,2020-01-27 01:06:57,Twitter for iPhone,649,5009

To my Republican colleagues who've complained that there's no new evidence in this impeachment trial: You voted more than ten times to block relevant witnesses and evidence. Don’t bury your head in the sand and then complain that it’s dark.,2020-01-24 18:50:51,Twitter for iPhone,20458,94941
Senate Republicans continue to say that there's "nothing new" in terms of the evidence presented at this impeachment trial.   Yet they voted down every amendment to enter new evidence into the proceedings.   Sounds duplicitous to me.   https://t.co/B15REikMRa,2020-01-24 14:45:29,Twitter Web App,221,903
Yes! Our country stands to tap into more of our economic potential by giving American workers a national paid family leave program. It's good for families businesses and the country.

Roe v. Wade was decided and settled 47 years ago—yet women still remain on the front lines of an uphill battle to defend their constitutional right to reproductive health care.   Reproductive rights are human rights.   Abortion needs to be accessible safe and legal. Full stop. https://t.co/k4hYfp7aXC,2020-01-22 23:44:59,Twitter for iPhone,200,949

If President Trump is innocent why is Mitch McConnell rushing through this trial in the dead of night without witnesses or additional evidence? A rush to judgement will be seen as a cover up and will do nothing to acquit the president in the eyes of the American people.,2020-01-22 17:32:15,Twitter Web App,738,3709
47 years since #RoevWade abortion access in our country hangs by a thread as anti-choice extremists push to overturn the decision. It’s nothing more than an assault on women’s reproductive rights. We face an uphill battle but we won’t turn back. I urge you to keep fighting. https://t.co/D55Q0Z50Ih,2020-01-22 14:52:08,Twitter Web App,223,847
The State Department has records involving officials who know first-hand about key events surrounding the president's interactions with the Ukraine. McConnell's refusal to allow this evidence make this trial look more and more like a sham with each passing minute.,2020-01-22 00:36:50,Twitter for iPhone,377,1705
Every senator including Sen. McConnell swore an oath to be impartial. A fair trial would include all relevant documents about the decision to freeze military assistance to Ukraine. His refusal to admit evidence and relevant witnesses is a disgrace.,2020-01-21 21:41:59,Twitter for iPhone,2815,12833
As we mark 10 years since the disastrous #CitizensUnited ruling let's recommit to rooting out corruption in Washington and addressing the money and greed that corrupts politicians and prevents progress. We have to do everything we can to make our democracy fairer and more just.,2020-01-21 17:10:04,Twitter for iPhone,61,330
I feel called to do everything I can this year to see more women elected to Congress in November. That’s why I’m so excited and hopeful to be out on the trail with @getots. Hope you’re ready to join us: https://t.co/IQT3KtxJIj  https://t.co/8Ai2Tm9Nvj,2020-01-21 14:46:59,TweetDeck,55,408
The American people want a fair trial—they deserve full transparency and to hear the evidence. This process cannot and should not be rushed through in the dead of night as McConnell wants. https://t.co/8CzcR4JjNS,2020-01-21 01:27:48,Twitter for iPhone,311,1298
The electoral college is broken undemocratic and disenfranchising. It’s time that we move towards a system that better represents all Americans. I look forward to putting forth ideas to get us closer to a better system where every voter in every community counts. https://t.co/hIFfUmwONL,2020-01-21 00:31:40,Twitter Web App,678,4383
The truth is nothing changes in Washington without the activism of the people.  Let us take this time of challenge and controversy to stand on the right side of history. To rise up against hate and division. To fight for justice. #MLKDay,2020-01-20 21:35:28,Twitter for iPhone,38,250
Dr. King always reminded us that we have a responsibility to speak up—for the powerless for those not heard and less privileged.   We must take his lead and speak out against acts of violence bigotry and racism.   We must rise up with our action advocacy and votes. #MLKDay,2020-01-20 17:30:21,Twitter for iPhone,48,256
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. taught us that the real measure of our success and worth is where we stand in times of division and injustice. As we celebrate his legacy during this moment in our history his teachings and guidance resonate louder than ever before. #MLKDay,2020-01-20 14:46:00,Twitter for iPhone,78,390
