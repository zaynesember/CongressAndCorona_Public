Every year I reflect on how blessed I am to call South Dakota home.

We should be sitting down &amp; working on a reasonable targeted fiscally responsible #COVID relief bill. Republicans have been more than willing to do that. But the Democrats continue to insist upon a multi-trillion dollar bill consisting of a bunch of liberal wish list items. https://t.co/OC2EgJTkPc,2020-11-18 20:37:00,Twitter Media Studio,298,803

Republicans aren’t giving up on targeted #COVID relief but so far Democrats have shown no willingness for compromise. I hope that changes.

Just look at big tech’s public statements geographic concentration &amp; employee political donations (normally 80-90% Dem) and it’s clear why there's mistrust among Republican users.

I asked Mr. Zuckerberg &amp; Mr. Dorsey to provide a complete list of the newspaper articles their companies have suppressed or limited the distribution of over the past five years + an explanation of why they suppressed each article.

Due to big tech’s secrecy around content moderation practices it’s impossible to know for sure if political bias exists but recent examples of content suppression certainly seem to suggest that it does.

Judge Barrett’s intelligence knowledge and judicial temperament have been on display since day one of her confirmation processes.

Democrats spent this weekend trying to delay the #SCOTUS vote –unsuccessfully I might add and with no dispute over Judge Amy Coney Barrett’s obvious qualifications. The Senate will perform its constitutional duty today &amp; Democrats can't stop that. https://t.co/5OuxCg5N2h,2020-10-26 23:17:58,Twitter Media Studio,27,177
One of the main reasons many Republicans ran for the Senate was to be in a position to restore the Supreme Court to its original constitutional purpose as a judicial body not a legislative one. We ran for this. We were elected for this. Today we will follow through. https://t.co/0zCBPn2ejY,2020-10-26 22:06:45,Twitter Media Studio,761,2947

Democrats’ attempted delay antics over the last seven-plus days were absurd.

Watching today's hearing you would’ve thought it was a floor debate on health care. Dems know they can’t fault Judge Barrett on her merits so they’re relying on scare tactics.

Despite the Dem-led misinformation campaign filling this SCOTUS seat follows historical Senate norms. There is a different precedent if you have a divided government (2016) vs. having the same party in control in the WH &amp; Senate (now).

Many GOP senators – myself included – decided to run for office for this very reason: to be in a position to restore the court to its original constitutional purpose as a judicial body not a legislative one.

I hope every American understands what's been happening in Congress w/ #COVID relief funding. Republicans have been trying in earnest to pass a bill; we've offered multiple versions &amp; pursued negotiations. Dems intro’d one spending spree bill &amp; adamantly refused to compromise.,2020-09-10 19:05:45,Twitter Web App,282,448
If Dems really shared Republicans’ urgency to deliver relief to Americans they'd work w/ us to get a compromise bill through Congress. Yet they refuse to negotiate. The logical conclusion is that Dems with eyes on November would rather have a political issue than pass a bill. https://t.co/Oo1FiT2Pc4,2020-09-10 18:38:05,Twitter Media Studio,67,100
It's wild to me that Dems just blocked GOP’s bill that would’ve put billions in relief funds toward students vaccine research American jobs &amp; more areas of immediate need.

Republicans want to pass a coronavirus relief bill &amp; we’re ready to negotiate. But Democrats have to want to come to the table. ‘Our way or the highway’ is not a negotiating position.

Republicans have offered multiple proposals for the next step of #COVID19 relief yet each time Democrats come back with the same response: "pass the HEROES Act.” 1.

When Republicans announced our #COVID19 relief bill we knew our version wouldn’t be the final draft &amp; were open to negotiating.

Let me be clear: Any suggestion that Republicans somehow didn’t want a debate on police reform is patently false. We stand ready to act today.

The page gets turned at a shocking speed on Capitol Hill but let me remind you why we’re considering #NDAA this week and not Senator Scott’s policing reform bill: Democrats filibustered the debate from beginning in the Senate. https://t.co/xVQafrvx44,2020-06-30 19:50:39,Twitter Media Studio,80,166
The #NDAA is one of the most important pieces of legislation we pass every year. Historically we’ve always been able to get it done in a bipartisan fashion. I hope that will hold true this year.,2020-06-30 19:08:07,Twitter Web App,3,9

I was hoping that Senate Democrats would put politics aside and work with @SenateGOP to pass a bipartisan police reform bill. Sadly that did not happen. Democrats just blocked even debating @SenTimScott’s #JUSTICEAct. Talk is cheap. Our job is to legislate. America wants action. https://t.co/AhorpUq5P5,2020-06-24 18:55:54,Twitter Media Studio,39,98
Unbelievable. Dems just blocked the Senate from debating police reform. Democrats have totally exposed their real motives (it’s not creating change or finding viable solutions). Americans are calling out for justice equality &amp; ACTION. But Dems are just focused on politics. Wow.,2020-06-24 17:02:26,Twitter Web App,693,1720
If Senate Democrats prevent us from debating amending or voting on the #JUSTICEact this week they’re doing more than blocking @SenatorTimScott’s bill they’re blocking an open bipartisan debate on policing reform – something nearly all of them have said they support. https://t.co/slcMhIGiHf,2020-06-23 18:59:15,Twitter Media Studio,15,64
Shocked by Dems’ indications that they will vote against having a policing reform debate in the Senate.

I hope Dems see that &amp; stop their obstruction.,2020-06-23 17:31:10,Twitter Web App,99,321

I sincerely hope Dems work w/ GOP to make this a moment of ACTION instead of a moment of rhetoric.  @SenatorTimScott’s #JUSTICEact is based in solutions that have been advocated for on both sides of the aisle.

I agree mayor.   I can’t wrap my head around this: We’re hearing calls for more police training mixed in with calls to #DefundThePolice. Less funding means less money for training programs.

Just left a @SenateCommerce hearing on broadband during #COVID19. It’s clear that access to reliable internet services is a key part of what’s kept our society turning during this crisis (i.e. distance learning for students teleworking and essential telehealth services). https://t.co/DtbByoA73G,2020-05-13 17:53:44,Twitter Media Studio,8,38
House Dems unveiled a $3 trillion #COVID19 bill. $3 TRILLION – all borrowed on the backs of our children &amp; grandchildren. We haven’t yet seen all the effects of the $2.4 trillion we already provided. Once that's been fully allocated we will have a better sense if more is needed. https://t.co/Mfbz4bueEQ,2020-05-13 16:19:52,Twitter Media Studio,9,50
House Dems' bill includes tons of non-#COVID19 items. I keep hearing this bill branded as “CARES 2.” They're trying to tie it to GOP’s bipartisan #CARESACT to disguise their bad policy. It’s a stretch to even call this a Phase IV approach since it has no chance of becoming law. https://t.co/eGuXMuDJTu,2020-05-12 23:50:11,Twitter Media Studio,21,59
House Dems have frantically cobbled together a 1815-page partisan bill at the cost of $3 TRILLION. Republicans have been left out of negotiations. This is a partisan messaging exercise plain and simple aimed at scoring as many political points as possible. https://t.co/YJxcmVgV0R,2020-05-12 20:29:54,Twitter Media Studio,226,492
