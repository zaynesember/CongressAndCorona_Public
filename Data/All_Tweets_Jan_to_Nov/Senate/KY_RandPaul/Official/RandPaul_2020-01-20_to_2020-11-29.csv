It is long last time to bring our troops home and stop the endless wars. I’m pleased to see this progress and am thankful to @realDonaldTrump for his willingness to put America first and work to finally get our troops out of Afghanistan.    https://t.co/nTJCouyk8h,2020-02-29 18:42:15,Twitter for iPhone,1719,6588
History has repeatedly proven just how dangerous it can be when we sacrifice our rights to create a temporary – and ultimately false – sense of security. We must reform FISA. https://t.co/UjjPzbWkXD,2020-02-27 19:15:25,Twitter Media Studio,2599,7071
Spoke with @realDonaldTrump . He agrees that the secret FISA court (intended to be used on foreign spies) should be forbidden from ever spying on or investigating Americans and that Congress should act NOW to make sure of that!,2020-02-27 17:39:17,Twitter for iPhone,5606,15971
Good talk with @realDonaldTrump yesterday and I’m pleased he is urging FISA reform NOW - and not a reauthorization of the current Patriot Act.  Looking forward to working with @Jim_Jordan and others to make these needed reforms happen now! https://t.co/66o0GKfPuL,2020-02-27 14:22:18,Twitter for iPhone,6079,19341

A.G. Barr advocating for ‘clean renewal’ of Patriot Act without any legislation to reform FISA is a disservice to @realDonaldTrump and should be roundly defeated.
