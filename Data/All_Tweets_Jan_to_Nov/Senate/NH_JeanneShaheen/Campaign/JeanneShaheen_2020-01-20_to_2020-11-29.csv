I just stepped out of the debate studio and if you tuned in I hope I made you proud.  I’m going to keep fighting to make a difference for New Hampshire but I need your help.

This isn’t hard @CorkyForSenate.  Pre-existing conditions exist. https://t.co/TmoKYqYuz3,2020-10-20 23:55:33,Twitter Web App,15,58
As the only women on the Foreign Relations Committee I’ve taken on China directly.  .@CorkyForSenate talks tough on China but represented their government in a law suit against an American manufacturer. From the AP: https://t.co/OLEGPKwLFS #WMURDebate https://t.co/wqLnpBKg8E,2020-10-20 23:50:39,Twitter Web App,17,31
I will never budge on supporting a woman’s right to make her own decisions about her own body especially when it comes to her health.  @CorkyForSenate has supported draconian abortion laws that would put women’s health at risk. #WMURDebate https://t.co/4RkcXizNAq,2020-10-20 23:42:41,Twitter Web App,10,35
Amy Coney Barrett’s troubling views on the ACA and Roe v. Wade put health care and women’s rights at risk.  @CorkyForSenate would support Mitch McConnell’s effort to ram her nomination through the Senate. #WMURDebate,2020-10-20 23:38:52,Twitter Web App,23,74
The White House owes America a plan to beat COVID-19 but the Trump administration doesn’t have one.  Meanwhile @CorkyForSenate has praised Trump’s response from the beginning - while ignoring the need among Granite Staters for relief aid. #WMURDebate,2020-10-20 23:17:09,Twitter Web App,4,13
24000 New Hampshire small biz got support because of the PPP that I helped negotiate.  The bill that Mitch McConnell brought to the floor doesn’t do nearly enough for hospitals schools and businesses - and @CorkyForSenate would have rubber-stamped it. #WMURDebate https://t.co/sKp8NvDpxS,2020-10-20 23:12:16,Twitter Web App,12,23
Getting through the COVID-19 crisis means following the science and investing in testing and tracing to get our state back on track.  Leadership means setting an example and @CorkyForSenate hasn’t demonstrated that he understands the severity of this crisis. #WMURDebate,2020-10-20 23:08:27,Twitter Web App,6,18

My opponent @CorkyForSenate has denied that pre-existing conditions exist.  These Granite Staters have lived with pre-existing conditions and they know the truth: if we lose the ACA they could lose their health care coverage.  That's why I'm fighting to defend it. https://t.co/aVgIg0582M,2020-10-20 01:15:54,Twitter Web App,9,42
This election is a choice between two different visions for New Hampshire.  I'm fighting for one where health care education and jobs are available to every Granite Stater.  It's a future worth fighting for and we can build it together - but we have to vote! https://t.co/yCYwgBjgto,2020-10-19 18:45:23,Twitter Web App,12,42
I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again:  This is the most important election of our lifetimes. With so much at stake we can’t afford to leave anything to chance.  If you haven’t voted yet go to https://t.co/6zED7g3L9u today and decide when and how you’ll cast your ballot.,2020-10-19 16:31:44,Twitter Web App,20,41
The Affordable Care Act. Women's reproductive rights. LGBTQ rights. Voting rights.  They are all on the ballot this year - but you don't have to wait until November 3rd to vote.  Go to https://t.co/6zED7g3L9u find your clerk's office and make a plan to vote before Election Day. https://t.co/HGa0xiadUe,2020-10-18 21:41:21,Twitter Web App,27,69
Marilla Ricker was a pioneer for women's rights and for the right to vote. This is a fitting tribute to an iconic New Hampshire suffragette and there's no better way to honor her legacy than by using the right she fought for.  Vote! https://t.co/lfJoCYMWTz,2020-10-18 17:44:28,Twitter Web App,4,10

New Hampshire small businesses are integral parts of our communities and our economy. Nothing should stand in the way of any Granite Stater with a dream of running their own business and as long as I'm in the Senate I’ll keep working to help our small businesses thrive.

.@ennagrazier owner of Enna Chocolate in Exeter picked up the keys to her brand new storefront in March - just as COVID-19 hit.

Today I met with leaders at Hanover Hills Nursing Home one of many long-term care facilities hurt by COVID-19. It's unacceptable that nursing homes won't get the support they need from McConnell's relief bill &amp; I'm fighting to make sure they get help. https://t.co/4hj8xHQpxm,2020-10-17 01:10:09,Twitter for Android,5,25
I'm proud that our campaign has the support of over 200 of New Hampshire's veterans. I'll continue to work for them in the Senate and to make sure they get the benefits they deserve for their service. https://t.co/SFQxbZkesP,2020-10-16 20:48:51,Twitter Web App,12,47
Veterans who fought for our country deserve a senator who fights for them. From creating job opportunities to providing access to health care closer to home and outside the VA I've made a difference for Granite State veterans throughout my career &amp; I will always fight for them. https://t.co/vmXclqBH19,2020-10-16 14:39:52,Twitter Web App,16,24
This #SpiritDay I’m standing in solidarity with LGBTQ youth. Every person &amp; child should be proud of who they are without facing bullying or discrimination.

New Hampshire: today is the LAST DAY to fill out the Census!  The Census will help determine funding for our state over the next 10 years and we need every Granite Stater to be counted.  Take a few minutes to fill it out before today's deadline at https://t.co/s2laRhx51l.,2020-10-15 18:23:20,Twitter Web App,3,9
I don’t believe we should consider a nominee to the Supreme Court while millions of Americans are voting. Regardless Judge Barrett’s views on Roe v. Wade the ACA and Medicare are deeply concerning.  If her nomination comes to a vote in the Senate I’ll vote no. https://t.co/wVlzX8q0j2,2020-10-15 16:08:05,Twitter Media Studio,21,65
Thank you so much to all of you who tuned in to today's debate. With less than 20 days to go there's never been a more important time to get involved.

.@CorkyForSenate shouldn’t talk to me about leadership. As a governor and a senator I’ve taken on the tough fights and worked across the aisle to get things done.  I know about leadership I’ve led and it’s made a difference for the people of New Hampshire. #NHPR,2020-10-15 13:59:20,Twitter Web App,47,174
We can stand with law enforcement while still demanding accountability. I’ve worked to bring people together to find common ground on addressing racial inequities in our society - not just in policing but also in education health care and economic opportunity. #NHPR,2020-10-15 13:52:45,Twitter Web App,1,13
Since COVID-19 hit I’ve fought for relief for our small businesses hospitals and schools. @CorkyForSenate didn’t think they needed help. #NHPR https://t.co/2BSQGZH4xl,2020-10-15 13:45:44,Twitter Web App,15,34
Yesterday my opponent and his supporters heckled and shouted over Granite Staters who were sharing their struggles with pre-existing conditions.  They may do things that way in Colorado but that’s not how we treat each other in New Hampshire. #NHPR https://t.co/KOcuDSaAJV,2020-10-15 13:38:05,Twitter Web App,29,74
In New Hampshire over 100000 people have affordable health insurance because of the ACA. If Republicans like my opponent really wanted to replace it they could have offered a plan.  They haven’t - because they don’t have one. #NHPR,2020-10-15 13:35:41,Twitter Web App,20,52
I co-wrote the Paycheck Protection Program because I heard the concerns of our small businesses. The PPP has helped keep over 24000 small businesses open in New Hampshire and helped keep more than 206000 workers on payroll. #NHPR,2020-10-15 13:32:11,Twitter Web App,2,9
If we’re going to get New Hampshire’s economy back on track we need a new relief bill. Trump and McConnell’s package doesn’t address the needs of Granite Staters and I’m not going to leave half of our state behind when communities on the front lines are still in need. #NHPR,2020-10-15 13:24:35,Twitter Web App,7,25
When New Hampshire needed help to overcome COVID-19 I pushed for billions in funding for our small businesses for testing and tracing and to put people back to work.  If my opponent were in the Senate we wouldn’t have gotten any relief at all. #NHPR,2020-10-15 13:18:35,Twitter Web App,10,28

It's an honor to receive the endorsement of the @Keene_Sentinel.

For people like @FaltusEugene fighting for the Affordable Care Act isn't about politics.  It's about one simple fact: without the ACA he and 572000 Granite Staters with pre-existing conditions could be denied life-saving medical care. https://t.co/vXUKiwCRPs,2020-10-14 20:41:43,Twitter Web App,27,45
There are just 20 days left in this historic election. Many Granite Staters have cast their ballots already and you can be one of them!  Don't wait until Election Day to vote.

Phil and Judy have owned the Chesterfield Inn for years. COVID-19 nearly put them out of businesses.  When they needed help I got to work and co-wrote the PPP legislation that helped save 24000 small businesses like theirs.

My opponent made his position clear today: he won’t protect the #ACA because he doesn't understand the reality that 572k Granite Staters could lose their health care without it.  New Hampshire deserves a Senator who will fight to protect their care. I will as I always have. https://t.co/MHlqNWK9vr,2020-10-09 02:05:38,Twitter Web App,60,150

In New Hampshire and across the country the election is already underway. Voters are already casting their ballots.

I fought to make sure that any veteran could get coverage outside the VA and closer to home and cut through red tape to get them and their families the benefits they deserve. https://t.co/F1Z7ZpVihP,2020-09-04 19:55:55,Twitter Web App,4,15
Not even a day after multiple sources confirm Trump disparaged U.S. service members his admin is trying to shut down @starsandstripes a news outlet for active duty forces and veterans that's existed since the 1800s.

On this day in 2009 President Obama signed the #LillyLedbetter Fair Pay Act bringing us closer to equal pay for equal work. But with too many women still not receiving the same wages as their male counterparts we have much work to do to close the gender pay gap for good.,2020-01-29 18:08:35,Twitter Web App,6,13

It's time to reverse the flow of unlimited undisclosed money we’ve seen infect our democracy over the last decade.

The GOP is waging an all-out coordinated attack on reproductive rights in the states in Congress and in the courts. On the 47th anniv of #RoeVWade I'm recommitting myself to the fight against any and all efforts to roll back our progress. Women's rights are non-negotiable.,2020-01-22 18:44:29,Twitter Web App,7,33

One of my proudest days as NH Gov was signing the bill to make #MLKDay a state holiday 20 years ago. Dr. King's work and legacy have had a profound impact on me and remain as important as ever.
