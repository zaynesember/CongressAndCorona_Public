NEW: NH rural hospitals &amp; providers will receive $115.4M from CARES Act in response to #COVID19.

Glad the Trump admin heeded my bipartisan call for Medicare to cover costs of audio-only telehealth which is in high demand. This is especially important for rural areas that lack broadband. Cost should never be a barrier to care particularly for seniors amid #COVID19 outbreak.,2020-05-01 20:22:41,Twitter Web App,9,29

Pres Trump’s demand that postage rates be quadrupled is outrageous. Every community relies on USPS. It's particularly vital for seniors &amp; small businesses.

A time of crisis is not an opportunity for countries to move away from democratic values and norms. It's concerning to see the COVID-19 pandemic exploited in this way.

The Trump administration continues to raid funding that Congress provided for our national security and divert it to his border wall. This is unconstitutional and dangerous.

These funds are urgently needed to keep facilities open &amp; staff on payroll but our work is far from over. I’ll keep fighting to get NH the support we need to endure this crisis.,2020-04-29 18:12:17,Twitter Web App,5,29
Having access to news &amp; information you can trust was critical before the #COVID19 outbreak but even more so today as we endure this crisis. Granite Staters should take caution against dangerous misinformation &amp; rely on information from public health officials based on science. https://t.co/z6ekcP61MA,2020-04-29 16:59:34,Twitter Web App,6,7
We need to invest in our nation’s infrastructure. Bipartisan support exists.  Infrastructure development will create jobs near-term and pay dividends economically for decades. Mitch McConnell’s obstruction stands in the way. https://t.co/WOnTE5hqEk,2020-04-28 22:34:30,Twitter Web App,16,48
The Lifeline program can help families hard hit by COVID-19 stay connected to work health care and more – but only if they know about it.

This is why I was adamant in recent negotiations that Congress provide additional funding for this program. I’ll keep pushing the Trump admin to fix persistent problems in their implementation of small biz relief programs &amp; Congress must provide stringent oversight.,2020-04-28 19:52:14,Twitter Web App,4,10
NEW: Nearly $70M for 5500+ NH businesses has been approved through the EIDL program.

QUICK POLL: States counties &amp; towns provide many services like health care &amp; schooling but are struggling financially due to COVID-19.

Small community lenders are being crowded out of access by bigger banks. Large companies who aren’t in need are getting funding. Tech problems persist. Funding for hires &amp; system upgrades need to be fully utilized. We need to hear directly from admin officials about these issues.,2020-04-28 16:16:42,Twitter Web App,7,22
It’s time for Senate oversight hearings of small business relief programs (PPP &amp; EIDL). These can be done virtually.
