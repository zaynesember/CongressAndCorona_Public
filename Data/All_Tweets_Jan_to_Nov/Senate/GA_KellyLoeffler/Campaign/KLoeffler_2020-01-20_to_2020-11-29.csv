.@ReverendWarnock is the most anti-Second Amendment candidate in the country.  Endorsed by every major anti-gun group he’s repeatedly attacked our Constitutional rights in his sermons.  Warnock will undermine our safety and take away our gun rights. #gapol #gasen https://t.co/WRryGA3gNh,2020-11-16 21:17:42,Twitter Web App,249,725
.@ReverendWarnock — this is disturbing &amp; it’s time to come clean with the people of Georgia.  This police report describes your behavior as "uncooperative and disruptive."  What sort of child abuse was occurring at your camp? https://t.co/Qjqe1E0GVU #gapol #gasen,2020-11-16 20:34:47,TweetDeck,333,690
Georgians the stakes couldn’t be higher.   Schumer &amp; Pelosi want to transform America. And they’ll have a free pass to do so if they win in Georgia.  Help @Perduesenate &amp; me save our country: https://t.co/q92O3Djth7 #gapol #gasen,2020-11-16 20:10:28,Twitter Web App,84,284
And @ReverendWarnock refuses to say where he stands on issues that would change America as we know it — be it Court packing or DC statehood.   He supports both. He just doesn’t want Georgians to know it. #gapol #gasen https://t.co/wKga9NHYjQ,2020-11-16 20:10:27,Twitter Web App,90,303
.@ReverendWarnock’s long history of anti-Israel sermons &amp; rhetoric has also been exposed.   He’s called the West Bank an apartheid state and he’s compared Israel to an oppressive regime.  Unlike him I will ALWAYS stand with Israel. https://t.co/6XnmpQrb78 #gapol #gasen,2020-11-16 20:10:20,Twitter Web App,33,90
