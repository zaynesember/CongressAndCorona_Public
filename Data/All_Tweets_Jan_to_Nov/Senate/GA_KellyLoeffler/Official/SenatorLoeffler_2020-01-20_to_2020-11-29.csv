I was raised on my family's farm. I worked hard &amp; achieved the American Dream.  How's this related to impeachment?

Great news. @CMSGov is giving states more flexibility when it comes to Medicaid by allowing each state to customize their program based on what their citizens need.

I asked last night: In Jan '99 Biden argued against deposing additional witnesses and seeking new evidence ahead of Clinton's impeachment. Politico reported that Schumer agreed with the rule.

Day 9 of impeachment… I know I can’t believe it either.    Another day wasted on this circus when we could be doing good work for the American people like @realdonaldtrump is.

Last night I saw the light at the end of the impeachment tunnel.

Answer: “The short answer is yes...that is a major problem and major defect in the way the House proceedings occurred that infects this record. It means that it is not a record that could be relied upon to reach any conclusion other than an acquittal for the president.”,2020-01-30 13:23:00,Twitter for iPhone,66,302
My last question yesterday w/ @MarshaBlackburn @SenHydeSmith @SenTomCotton @HawleyMO @SenJohnBarrasso @sendavidperdue @SenatorFischer @JohnCornyn: As a fact witness who was coordinating with the whistleblower did Schiff’s handling of the inquiry create due process issues? https://t.co/HiWFoCLcrs,2020-01-30 13:20:35,Twitter Media Studio,345,1112
Attended my 1st VA committee mark-up today aimed at expanding access to mental health services for veterans.  We lose 20 veterans a day to suicide which is 20 too many.

Answer: The House standard is lower but they didn’t even meet it. They sent over a weak case based on hearsay not facts.   Failure to provide evidence = Trump’s acquittal.

Here are my takeaways:  @realDonaldTrump’s team undermined your entire “case” in 2 hours.   You failed to get the job done. They proved that. No convincing evidence. Just baseless attacks.   A fair trial happened in the Senate &amp; you don’t get a do-over. It’s time to move on! https://t.co/dPK6qfiuQn,2020-01-29 02:37:04,Twitter for iPhone,208,659

In short order @realDonaldTrump 's legal team summarized the Articles of Impeachment sent over from @SpeakerPelosi. Article 1 -The House doesn't like @POTUS. Article 2 - The Democrats don't think they can beat @POTUS in November. #gapol,2020-01-28 17:54:52,Twitter Web App,272,973
