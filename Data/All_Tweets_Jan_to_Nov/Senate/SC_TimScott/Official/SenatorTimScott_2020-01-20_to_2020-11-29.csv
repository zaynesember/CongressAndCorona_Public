We have to find ways to encourage investments in our economy that produce results. My Supporting America’s Restaurant Workers Act provides a 100% deduction for business meals.

Total misinformation right here. The House bill does the same thing on chokeholds for state and local police as the #JUSTICEAct. The House bill doesn’t ban state/local no knocks. Federal bans wouldn’t have saved Mr. Garner or Ms. Taylor.  Now - lets vote to debate the #JUSTICEAct https://t.co/COZLtaI26u,2020-06-24 15:36:10,Twitter for iPhone,1238,2981

Part Two of today's floor speech on the #JUSTICEAct:  Some of my colleagues on the other side just want to score political points. The majority has the same heart that I have for the American people.
