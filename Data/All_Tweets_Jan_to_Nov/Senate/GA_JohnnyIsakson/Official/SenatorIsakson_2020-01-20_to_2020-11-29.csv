I applaud @GovKemp on selecting Trey Kilpatrick as his chief of staff. Trey was a valuable member of my U.S. Senate team. He is smart dedicated &amp; brings the experience needed for the role. I wish Trey &amp; the Kemp administration the best as they continue to put Georgians first. https://t.co/ott1Kas0Kj,2020-10-07 21:32:23,Twitter for iPhone,27,174
