RIGHT NOW Trump is in court trying to take healthcare away from millions—including protections for pre-existing conditions.    During a deadly pandemic that's killed more than 210000 Americans.

Trump has reportedly spoken to Putin AT LEAST EIGHT TIMES since he was given intelligence that Russia might be paying bounties for American troops' lives. But he "never discussed it with him."

Republicans: We're going to shield corporations from liability if their employees get sick.  Also Republicans: We refuse to implement an OSHA safety standard that would help keep essential workers safe on the job during the #COVID19 crisis.,2020-07-29 01:52:28,Twitter for iPhone,2940,7633
No rent assistance. No food assistance. No money to help state &amp; local governments keep essential workers on payroll.

#COVID19 is spreading like wildfire in our nursing homes—and yet Republicans saw no need to include any money or aid in their proposal for these facilities who are on the frontlines struggling to contain infections and save lives. Absolutely unacceptable.,2020-07-28 23:09:56,Twitter Web App,1142,3777

The Law and Order Administration is once again literally ignoring court orders. That's not Law and Order it's what authoritarians do.

They also seem to think asking those who are still out of work b/c of how poorly they &amp; Trump have managed this pandemic to take a 30% pay cut is an acceptable long-term solution. It isn’t.

Let’s be clear: Republicans refused to act for MONTHS on a #COVID19 bill. They wouldn't even vote on the #HEROESAct.

Yesterday we celebrated 30 years of the ADA &amp; today Senate Republicans unveiled a #COVID19 proposal that would gut disability rights at a time when these protections are needed as much as ever.

#OTD 14 years ago President Bush signed the Voting Rights Act Reauthorization into law—extending the VRA of 1965.

In the past 31 days Donald Trump has called #BlackLivesMatter a symbol of hate.  He's sent unidentified federal agents to police Portland streets against peaceful protesters.

30 years after the ADA became law too many continue to think that someone living with a disability will lead a lesser life.

First Donald Trump encouraged Russia to interfere in our democracy and they did.   Now Russia is secretly paying militants to *kill* U.S. troops.

2.5K residents of DC serve in the US Armed Forces. 23K are Veterans. 242 were casualties of the Vietnam War. 1K were killed in action in WWII.

#COVID19 is surging &amp; what does Trump do?  ❌Defunds testing sites in 5 states. ❌Spews racist slurs. ❌Files brief to rip away healthcare coverage &amp; eliminate protections for those with pre-existing conditions which would include survivors of #COVID19. https://t.co/rWVLMM8REw,2020-06-25 21:51:11,Twitter Web App,378,663

It’s no surprise that Trump’s OSHA has failed to issue a single citation when they won’t even agree to issue an enforceable standard. In March I introduced legislation to require OSHA to set an emergency standard to protect frontline health care workers.  https://t.co/pQF5p8pOrq,2020-05-18 20:52:28,Twitter Web App,35,106
Millions of workers have been laid off.  Millions continue to show up for essential work.   OSHA is tasked w/ enforcing safe workplace environments to protect our workers yet—despite countless complaints— hasn’t issued a single citation since the start of the #COVID19 crisis. https://t.co/ZAVCuzh44l,2020-05-18 20:52:27,Twitter Web App,42,152
I joined @SenBooker and @RepPressley in calling for @TheJusticeDept to conduct an independent federal investigation into the brutal murder of an unarmed #AhmaudArbery &amp; whether county officials violated his civil rights by failing to even arrest let alone prosecute his killers.,2020-05-18 18:18:30,Twitter for iPhone,97,429
Let me be clear: when Trump attacks Vote by Mail he’s attacking our Veterans’ right to vote.   Our Vietnam Vets are at risk due to Agent Orange exposure &amp; our Iraq/Afghanistan Vets are at risk due to burn pit exposure—asking them to endanger their lives just to vote is SHAMEFUL. https://t.co/OsZ23Q7KXo,2020-05-18 16:45:10,Twitter for iPhone,893,2315

After Trump repeatedly used his platform to try to racialize #COVID19 we continue to see spikes in discrimination against Asian Americans. We must speak out against these racist acts &amp; those who stoke fears about a virus we know strikes w/o regard to the color of a person’s skin,2020-05-15 21:42:50,Twitter for iPhone,238,893
If we don’t nip this in the bud we could have a much bigger problem on our hands.

#ICYMI: I spoke to @NicolleDWallace of @MSNBC about how shameful it is that when it comes to safeguarding our children from illnesses potentially linked to #COVID19 Trump is more worried about himself and how he looks rather than listening to scientists like Dr. Fauci. https://t.co/gSm0kl3rpq,2020-05-15 19:30:00,Twitter Media Studio,54,218

Talking at 1000 Cadets &amp; putting them into a single space just to stroke his own ego is the height of narcissism.

Trump can't seem to sink low enough when it comes to how he treats our military men and women.

America’s Governors in some of the hardest hit states are working around the clock to secure critical equipment for our healthcare heroes working on the frontlines during the deadly #COVID19 pandemic.

Donald Trump’s basic responsibility is to keep Americans safe. The rising death count shows that he’s failing.   Instead of spending his time deflecting blame he should start *listening* to Governors &amp; giving them the supplies they need to fight the #COVID19 public health crisis https://t.co/k6jGVuyFqM,2020-04-21 01:53:30,Twitter for iPad,96,452

Illinois had its deadliest weekend from the #COVID19 pandemic &amp; we need more tests more contact tracing more ventilators &amp; more #PPE.   We aren't getting it.   It's basically criminal what Trump is doing when it comes to failing to provide the resources all of our states need. https://t.co/hc0i0bd4TZ,2020-04-20 03:35:46,Twitter Media Studio,264,795

For Americans in need of ventilators at hospitals in Illinois or anywhere in America right now they don’t care where it comes from. Or who is to blame. That doesn't matter.   What they need is help. That’s what effective leaders do. And it’s the opposite of what Trump has done. https://t.co/vUDHzo6waR,2020-04-18 02:19:18,Twitter Media Studio,125,487
As he watches Americans die by the thousands Trump remains incapable of showing empathy or leadership. He *could* have saved lives by sending more ventilators but he didn’t. That’s true regardless of who Donald “I don’t take responsibility at all” Trump tries to blame. https://t.co/W9KGDXZk4d,2020-04-17 22:36:33,Twitter for iPad,491,1736
Donald Trump is literally encouraging people to put their own health—and everyone else’s health—at risk. Americans will die if they listen to him instead of public health experts. https://t.co/c34kV57zZH,2020-04-17 22:24:22,Twitter for iPad,159,803

For the sake of all Americans who have lost their lives to #COVID19—and the countless more that will succumb—I wish Trump had been as eager to prepare our country for this pandemic as he is to rush towards normalcy when his own experts are warning "we’re not there yet." https://t.co/wNKG4KmSE6,2020-04-16 15:22:09,Twitter Web App,56,237
That’s why I’m urging @FCC to immediately call on telecommunications providers serving law enforcement facilities across the nation to provide free phone calls &amp; video visitations to better enable families to communicate with incarcerated loved ones during the #COVID19 pandemic.,2020-04-15 20:56:20,Twitter for iPhone,17,87

#COVID19 is also a stark reminder why Congress must pass the FAMILY Act.

After such strong evidence presented by the House managers pointing toward the President’s guilt I would think his defense attorneys would want witnesses and documents that could exonerate him. That's how American justice works - both sides present evidence &amp; argue their case. https://t.co/HbmyVw4h89,2020-01-25 20:25:12,Twitter Media Studio,836,3228
From 2010 to 2018 over 76000 non-citizens became citizens after serving but the yearly rate dropped from 11230 in 2010 to 4135 in 2018.  I called on @USGAO to review the effectiveness of our military naturalization policies which haven't been reviewed in nearly a decade. https://t.co/stDRbuy8SB,2020-01-25 14:05:33,Twitter for iPhone,71,236
Happy #LunarNewYear! For all those celebrating I hope the year of the rat brings you prosperity and luck.

But that will require more than falsehoods and conspiracy theories—it will require facts and evidence and that’s exactly what witnesses and documents could provide. If they don’t want them then what are they hiding?,2020-01-25 02:19:39,Twitter for iPhone,48,377
I took an oath to remain an impartial juror and intend to do just that. I remain open to the possibility that Trump’s lawyers will present an equally persuasive case in his defense.,2020-01-25 02:19:39,Twitter for iPhone,33,270
Right now we have a lot of evidence pointing to Trump’s guilt and not much suggesting he’s not guilty. With such a strong case against the President I do not understand why his defense counsel has opposed bringing witnesses and documents that could exonerate him.,2020-01-25 02:19:38,Twitter for iPhone,37,180
After 3 days of opening arguments House managers have laid out a strong case against the President. Their arguments were well documented thorough and compelling. Tomorrow Trump’s attorneys will begin their defense.,2020-01-25 02:19:38,Twitter for iPhone,122,856
CDC has confirmed they are sending a team to quarantine any potential spread. We are in the earliest stages of measuring the impact of novel coronavirus but it is being taken very seriously.

There's been a 2nd confirmed case of #coronavirus in the US in Chicago. @SenatorDurbin and I commend the Chicago hospital personnel for identifying this quickly. We also commend @chicagosmayor and others who monitor travelers and visitors from Wuhan China.,2020-01-24 21:06:49,Twitter Web App,63,211
Pleased to join @SenatorDurbin in announcing a $1.2m federal grant to @ProjectSYNCERE a group on Chicago’s Southside that educates youth about STEM.

I’m glad @SenatorDurbin and @SenatorRounds joined me in making this important bipartisan request for a review of our military naturalization policies.  I’ll keep working to make sure no one willing to wear our uniform is deported by the same nation they sacrificed to defend. https://t.co/IEkZ6eoHIE,2020-01-24 14:12:03,Twitter for iPhone,75,265
7yrs ago Pres Obama lifted the @DeptofDefense's exclusion of women in combat. As one of the 1st female Army pilots to fly combat missions I've seen firsthand how our military is stronger&amp;our nation safer when we stop excluding whole categories of Americans from military service,2020-01-24 13:53:24,Twitter for iPhone,189,1172
Throughout my career I’ve taken oaths to defend the Constitution &amp; they have guided me every hour of every day as a Soldier and now a Senator.

Since the beginning of the Trump Admin the attack on women's healthcare has been relentless. 3 years ago today the Admin reinstated the #GlobalGagRule - making it harder for women everywhere to get full reproductive care. We must end this restriction once &amp; for all. #NoGagRule,2020-01-23 14:01:57,Twitter for iPhone,120,449
The @USNatArchives is a national treasure. It must be protected from political interference.  That’s why I asked the Inspector General to conduct an independent investigation into this alarming censorship. https://t.co/46hqpjQmS6 https://t.co/Hp1swXHuFG,2020-01-23 12:40:07,Twitter for iPhone,71,264
Day one of opening arguments has now concluded. I continue to be disappointed that my Republican colleagues have shown no interest in having a full and open trial.  A fair trial has witnesses and documents. Cover-ups don’t.  More of my thoughts here: https://t.co/1Cukb76dnu,2020-01-23 02:51:58,Twitter for iPhone,590,2382

Unreal. The five-time draft dodger who literally said that *avoiding STDs* was his “personal Vietnam” thinks that it’s not “serious” that U.S. troops might have suffered traumatic brain injuries when Iran responded to his #Soleimani strike. https://t.co/Dk1t77a73g (1/5) https://t.co/SpGaFmkCii,2020-01-22 18:05:27,Twitter for iPad,232,524
For 47 yrs #RoevWade has enshrined the safety dignity &amp; economic security of women while respecting their right to control their bodies. Trump &amp; his allies are determined to roll back women’s constitutional right to make private reproductive health decisions—we can't let them.,2020-01-22 14:13:51,Twitter Web App,393,1260
Unfortunately reports of @CBP detaining Iranian-Americans seems entirely consistent with Trump’s record. My colleagues and I are demanding answers. https://t.co/v3jwzfd4zo,2020-01-21 14:55:52,Twitter Web App,97,279
Detaining U.S. citizens at airports or ports of entry based solely on their national origin is not only discriminatory but in clear violation of our nation’s values and @CBP guidance. https://t.co/eiwRejzyK3,2020-01-21 14:55:50,Twitter Web App,123,389
The oath I took to be impartial means something to me and I hope it does to at least 4 of my Republican colleagues as well—they may be our last chance for getting anything close to a fair trial.,2020-01-21 01:52:04,Twitter for iPad,458,1856
#MidnightMitch has already admitted he’s working hand-in-hand with Trump on the #impeachment trial &amp; violating his oath to be impartial—but his proposed rules for the trial (holding the trial at 1am??) are yet more evidence that he’s helping the White House perpetrate a cover-up. https://t.co/L2TzAeUuuB,2020-01-21 01:52:03,Twitter for iPad,4360,8425
