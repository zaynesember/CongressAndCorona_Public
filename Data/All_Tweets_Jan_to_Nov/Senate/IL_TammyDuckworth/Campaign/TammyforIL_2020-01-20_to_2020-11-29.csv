Looking for a new job while singlehandedly blocking the Biden transition from formally beginning is the height of hypocrisy AND a dangerous threat to our national security. https://t.co/SAe5HJjZsM,2020-11-16 19:50:21,Twitter Web App,76,324
Our troops will always do whatever they can to keep us safe but they deserve better than a Commander in Chief who makes their job harder and puts our national security at risk. https://t.co/Nzc2D17W5o,2020-11-13 16:13:52,Twitter Web App,16,98
While there is no way I can ever repay my buddies who saved my life sixteen years ago I will never stop trying. Making sure I don’t let them down is what drives me to do everything I can for our military community every single day from the United States Senate. (9/9),2020-11-12 23:12:40,Twitter Web App,10,113
These are the kinds of conversations I am proud to take part in from the Senate. Especially because we currently have far too few Veterans serving in Congress. We need our voices represented. (8/9),2020-11-12 23:12:40,Twitter Web App,4,83
This isn’t a choice between caring for our troops overseas or caring for our classrooms here at home. There’s no point in investing in new vertical-lift aircraft if we don’t invest in educating the kid who will one day grow up to pilot them. (7/9),2020-11-12 23:12:39,Twitter Web App,5,55

Sixteen years ago an RPG tore through the helicopter I was piloting over Iraq.

I’m ready to replace Donald Trump with @JoeBiden because we need a President who will actually show our troops the respect they deserve.  A President who understands the risks they face. A President who will respect the men and women of our military not insult them. (5/6),2020-09-04 17:56:11,Twitter Web App,26,81
But I have faith in our country. The American people know that no one should be ashamed of a disability and that Wounded Warriors should be honored instead of hidden from view.

Trump's actions diminish the office he holds and the Party he leads but they do not diminish the bravery of those who give up their lives to defend this nation or the sacrifices of wounded Soldiers who gave up our limbs as I did for all Americans including him. (3/6),2020-09-04 17:56:11,Twitter Web App,8,35
Of course @realDonaldTrump thinks about war selfishly. As a transactional cost—instead of in human lives and American blood spilled—because that’s how he’s viewed his whole life.  He doesn’t understand other people’s courage because he's never had any of his own. (2/6),2020-09-04 17:56:11,Twitter Web App,11,38
Since entering the presidential race @realDonaldTrump has been downright contemptuous of the sacrifices of others.

Our servicemembers deserve a Commander-in-Chief who understands the risks they face. Instead they have a Coward-in-Chief who won’t stand up to Putin read his intelligence briefings or even publicly admonish adversaries for reportedly putting bounties on our troops’ heads. (3/4),2020-08-21 02:11:04,Twitter Web App,42,218
.@JoeBiden understands those sacrifices because he has made them himself.  When his son Beau enlisted in the Army and deployed to Iraq that burden was shouldered by his family as well.

.@realdonaldtrump and @tuckercarlson should know that attacks from  insecure men who can’t tell the difference between patriotism and nationalism will never diminish my love for this country.

We NEED a President who can get us out of this public health + economic crisis. @JoeBiden's jobs plan will put us on the path towards economic recovery and build a better more inclusive economy for all Americans and working families. #BuildBackBetter https://t.co/uGvMn7hk9W,2020-07-09 23:24:21,Twitter Web App,224,699
.@JoeBiden is right. We need a Commander-In-Chief who isn’t afraid to protect our troops from our enemies. Trump must stop giving Putin a free pass. https://t.co/vknVePCGI3,2020-07-08 23:17:55,Twitter Web App,164,442
My family fought for our nation's independence alongside George Washington &amp; I'm a proud member of @TodaysDAR. @realdonaldtrump: focus on ending #COVID19 &amp; standing up to Putin instead of wasting time trying to distract people from your failures. https://t.co/9NIOORbkoq,2020-07-07 20:12:08,Twitter Web App,978,2868
Trump should be outraged about reports that Russia paid Taliban-linked militants to murder U.S. troops — and we the American people should be outraged that he’s not.  https://t.co/vFTkz5RqPO,2020-07-07 15:55:51,Twitter Web App,226,525
It is wrong for any President to seek vengeance against a Soldier for complying with a Congressional subpoena. I'm calling on Defense Sec. Esper to confirm he won't help enable Trump's retaliation against Vindman. (2/2) https://t.co/ugtrlEIKGN,2020-07-06 22:28:34,Twitter Web App,138,405
Lt. Col. Vindman did his patriotic duty by telling the truth under oath when he was subpoenaed to testify in front on Congress and if he — or any Soldier — has been recommended for promotion on his merits Donald Trump shouldn't retaliate or interfere.

Last night this President gave a dark speech ahead of the 4th of July but we’re not going to give in to those who seek to divide us. Instead we're going to work together to achieve the ideals that founded this country and make sure they hold true for every American. 4/4,2020-07-04 19:30:42,Twitter Web App,15,49
We talked about the hard times our Democracy is going through and about how sometimes protesting is the most patriotic thing you can do (*remember this country started with a protest in Boston*). 3/4,2020-07-04 19:29:30,Twitter Web App,11,42

Let’s get something straight: Trump might not be to blame for #COVID19 but his bad decisions *are* to blame for why things got so bad here—&amp;why more Americans will die than might have otherwise. “I don’t take responsibility at all” might be the most truthful thing he’s ever said,2020-04-15 16:22:11,Twitter Web App,10,22
The American ppl shouldn’t keep falling for Trump’s lies—like deflecting blame by cutting @WHO funding b/c they...(checks notes)...failed to “call out China’s lack of transparency.” I wish it we’re so easy to call out such obvious lies from a President but #TheresAlwaysATweet https://t.co/6RHl8TwFMt,2020-04-15 16:22:10,Twitter Web App,10,26
