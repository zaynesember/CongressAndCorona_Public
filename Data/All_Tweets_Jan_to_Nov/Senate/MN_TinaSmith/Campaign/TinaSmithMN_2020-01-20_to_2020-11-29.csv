Confirming Judge Barrett to the Supreme Court puts the Affordable Care Act and Roe v. Wade at risk. We’ve got to make our voices heard. #mnsen https://t.co/twjxDXKI0k,2020-10-03 01:16:25,Twitter Media Studio,31,155
The peaceful transfer of power is fundamental to American democracy. We shouldn’t even be having this discussion. #mnsen https://t.co/mT4JrtDweq,2020-10-03 00:31:31,Twitter Media Studio,25,138
Minnesota is home to so many refugees. They’re our neighbors friends and colleagues. It’s time Republicans treated them with respect. It’s shameful. #mnsen https://t.co/tT9Gml39PF,2020-10-02 23:38:25,Twitter Media Studio,71,439
Thank you to @mprnews for holding today’s important debate.   So much is at stake and it’s more important than ever to make our voices heard. I’m committed to fighting for you and lifting up your voices. #mnsen,2020-10-02 17:26:29,Twitter Web App,7,100
Almost 3 years ago I became your U.S. Senator &amp; 2 years ago you sent me back. I go to Washington every week thinking about you &amp; fighting for you — for your health care your schools your retirement &amp; your family’s opportunity. I’m not backing down now. https://t.co/JYxpVTccrg,2020-10-02 17:11:14,Twitter Web App,12,41
There’s so much at stake in this election. Are we going to come together and build forward or will we follow the path of division fear and chaos that my opponent is trying to lead us down?,2020-10-02 17:01:29,Twitter Web App,7,36
Today you heard real differences between me and my opponent. I’m a doer not a talker and I think compromise is a virtue not a vice which is why I’ve been able to get so much done for Minnesota. I’m fighting for you every single day. #mnsen https://t.co/fvxgWO01QJ,2020-10-02 17:01:06,Twitter Media Studio,43,124
Elections are the core of our democracy. From combatting Russian interference to stopping the Trump Administration’s efforts to sabotage USPS and vote by mail we’ve got to make sure voting is as safe and as accessible as possible in 2020. #mnsen,2020-10-02 16:59:17,Twitter Web App,10,42
Let’s give them results that are impossible to doubt. Vote. https://t.co/WfNSNOLVbH #mnsen,2020-10-02 16:57:08,Twitter Web App,10,44

Here’s the reality: the GOP may have the votes to confirm Judge Barrett. But the best thing we can do to stop &amp; slow them down is to raise our voices. When they tried to overturn the ACA YOU made your voices heard &amp; senators listened. Your voice is powerful — so use it. #mnsen,2020-10-02 16:41:54,Twitter Web App,57,256
There’s so much at stake with this SCOTUS nomination — the future of the ACA Roe v. Wade protections for immigrant communities equal justice under the law. I’m opposed to the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett &amp; the American people should make their voices heard. #mnsen,2020-10-02 16:41:19,Twitter Web App,27,99
Minnesotans know the threat of climate change is real and present. We need to work now to invest in climate change policies that would create clean energy jobs and opportunities in Minnesota. I’ve introduced legislation to put us on that path. #mnsen,2020-10-02 16:36:04,Twitter Web App,21,105
Whether it’s the flooding in Minnesota or the fires in the West millions of Americans are being displaced from their homes in the midst of a pandemic. Americans are living the disasters of climate change right now. We need to take bold action on climate change now. #mnsen https://t.co/jQ5hbOTwc2,2020-10-02 16:35:33,Twitter Media Studio,17,51
We need systemic reform in our policing. I support common-sense reforms like banning chokeholds &amp; no-knock warrants. We also need to invest in community-led solutions focused on keeping people safe &amp; giving them access to needed resources. #mnsen,2020-10-02 16:26:25,Twitter Web App,10,50
George Floyd Breonna Taylor Philando Castile &amp; countless others should still be alive. We must put a stop to violent policing &amp; get to the root of racism w/in our system. The Justice in Policing Act &amp; my Supporting Innovation in Public Safety Act would begin to do this. #mnsen,2020-10-02 16:26:12,Twitter Web App,19,105
I was proud to support strong bipartisan legislation to get direct individual support to Minnesotans to support small businesses &amp; our health care systems. Now we need to come together as Democrats &amp; Republicans to get Americans more relief amidst the pandemic. #mnsen,2020-10-02 16:21:20,Twitter Web App,12,39
Minnesotans are tired of the political gridlock in Washington. I’m proud of my record of bipartisanship. I’ll work with anyone and everyone to deliver for Minnesotans. #mnsen,2020-10-02 16:17:40,Twitter Web App,21,147
I was proud to advocate and vote for the CARES Act providing direct economic relief to businesses and individuals. Now as I’ve heard from Minnesotans about how they’re weathering the pandemic we’ve got to get them more relief. #mnsen https://t.co/Uy2VECgISM,2020-10-02 16:16:00,Twitter Web App,10,36
I’m proud to have authored legislation (now law) that provides free diagnostic COVID-19 testing for everybody in this country. Now we need to pass my legislation to make sure we have free vaccines for everyone once that vaccine is safe and available. #mnsen,2020-10-02 16:15:26,Twitter Web App,19,103
There is so much work to do so that everyone has the freedom and opportunity to build the lives they want. If you give me the honor of continuing to serve as Senator for Minnesota that’s what I’ll keep on doing. Minnesotans deserve leadership that gets things done for them.,2020-10-02 16:11:55,Twitter Web App,7,32
I go to work for you every day.

Trump refused to condemn white supremacists. Instead he doubled down on his support for a far-right hate group. On national television.   I could say he’s unfit to be President (he is) but it’s so much worse than that. https://t.co/knMifpiCqQ,2020-09-30 14:33:15,Twitter Web App,41,130

The Supreme Court made marriage equality the law of the land guaranteed LGBTQ+ workplace protections and so much more.   Trump’s SCOTUS nominee could revoke all of these things.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg will be the first woman to lie in state in the Capitol in our 244-year history.  I wish I was more shocked.  But RBG spent her career shattering glass ceilings.  It’s fitting that even in death she hasn’t stopped.,2020-09-22 20:53:59,Twitter Web App,136,884
By voting to confirm a Supreme Court nominee in an election year McConnell and Senate Republicans are breaking the precedent they set in 2016.  And for that we’ve got to vote them out. Help me keep MN blue and flip the Senate: https://t.co/GfkrYtLGKe,2020-09-22 18:17:06,Twitter Web App,25,91

Today — the first day of early voting &amp; 46 days until Election Day — we’re dealing with a global pandemic shaking the foundations of our health &amp; economic well-being.

My opponent takes the my way or the highway approach. Minnesotans want a Senator who gets things done. Maybe that’s why he was voted out. #mnsen https://t.co/XMjBO1imaO,2020-09-18 17:02:33,Twitter Web App,21,59

I believe the U.S. needs to be a leader in the global fight against climate change. Meanwhile my opponent said he was “in sync” with Donald Trump about withdrawing from the Paris Climate Agreement. That’s not leadership. #mnsen https://t.co/m0vyzCa9gl,2020-09-18 16:56:23,Twitter Web App,10,32
Climate change isn’t a distant problem. Americans are feeling the impacts of climate change right now. The U.S. should be a leader in the global fight against it &amp; we need to take bold action now to invest in a clean energy future. Our future is at stake. We can’t wait. #mnsen,2020-09-18 16:52:57,Twitter Web App,12,36
My opponent says he supports working Minnesota families but he doesn’t stand up for:  🛑 the right to unionize 🛑 $15/hour minimum wage 🛑 paid family and medical leave Doesn’t sound like he fights for working families to me. 🤔 #mnsen,2020-09-18 16:50:54,Twitter Web App,27,110
Right now we are in a public health &amp; economic crisis. And every day I think how can we build back better? I’m ready to work with anyone who is focused on building an economy that works for everyone not just those at the very top. #mnsen,2020-09-18 16:50:01,Twitter Web App,8,23
If my opponent cannot see that the horrific murders of George Floyd Breonna Taylor Philando Castile and so many others as tragic and devastating failures of our system he’s not fit to be a U.S. Senator. #mnsen,2020-09-18 16:48:22,Twitter Web App,3,45
My opponent has failed to recognize the injustices Black Brown &amp; Indigenous people have faced at the hands of police. His inability to acknowledge these tragedies &amp; commit to the work needed to root out the racism at the heart of these systems is dangerous &amp; cruel. #mnsen,2020-09-18 16:48:22,Twitter Web App,13,92
My opponent continues to spread lies about me. He keeps falsely saying that I support defunding the police. Let me make this clear: I do not support defunding the police. But I do believe we need to systematically reform policing in our communities. #mnsen,2020-09-18 16:44:52,Twitter Web App,73,389
We need to address the fundamental reality that if you’re a Black Brown or Indigenous person &amp; you see those police lights in your rearview mirror you're more likely to feel fear &amp; worry than a sense of safety. This legislation is a step towards helping fix this broken system.,2020-09-18 16:43:20,Twitter Web App,2,20
The time is now to fulfill the promise of equality for all Americans &amp; to eradicate the racism at the heart of so many of our systems. I was proud to help introduce the Justice in Policing Act which would provide common-sense reforms to hold police officers accountable. #mnsen,2020-09-18 16:43:20,Twitter Web App,7,23
Broadband is a necessity in every part of life — from connecting communities to education to health. I’ve fought to expand rural broadband led bipartisan efforts to protect rural co-ops &amp; secured funding for telehealth &amp; distance learning in the COVID-19 CARES Act. #mnsen,2020-09-18 16:40:00,Twitter Web App,8,44
So he was asked again last week - is there anything the President has done that you don’t support? His answer: “I have no disagreements.”   It’s no wonder he holds the nickname of Minnesota’s mini-Trump. #mnsen https://t.co/3iZP14uot7,2020-09-18 16:38:23,Twitter Web App,6,23
In February my opponent said he didn’t “oppose anything” Trump had done.   Since February Trump has lied to Americans about COVID-19 damaged our economy and blocked critical support for everyday Americans. #mnsen https://t.co/cx3taEgtI3,2020-09-18 16:38:14,Twitter Web App,7,32
Well I’ve got news for my opponent. To get things done for Minnesotans you’ve got to find compromise. https://t.co/QI2SMOQ4wR,2020-09-18 16:35:46,Twitter Media Studio,8,32
I’m in Washington to deliver for Minnesotans on the issues important to them. I’ve worked across the aisle to get things done. My opponent is against compromise &amp; working together. Minnesotans deserve a Senator with a record of bipartisanship. #mnsen,2020-09-18 16:33:38,Twitter Web App,8,73
I visited Duluth last month to talk to small business owners with @LarsonForDuluth. I heard about their challenges throughout this pandemic but I also heard how the community has come together to support one another. I will keep fighting to support small businesses. #mnsen https://t.co/9XRw7HyX14,2020-09-18 16:31:46,Twitter Media Studio,5,25
I support building an economy that works for everyone — not just those at the top. My opponent supports tax cuts for the wealthy &amp; big corporations. The choice is clear. #mnsen https://t.co/rgFhPvzMIN,2020-09-18 16:26:25,Twitter Media Studio,19,57
I’ve heard from small businesses workers &amp; families across MN who’ve been impacted by COVID-19. Their demands &amp; needs are clear: They need more support. That’s why I’ve fought for increased unemployment benefits funds for small businesses &amp; direct aid for our families. #mnsen,2020-09-18 16:22:58,Twitter Web App,6,36
I’m focused on creating jobs and opportunities in Minnesota — especially in Northern Minnesota. I helped secure funding to expand broadband and I strongly support investing in infrastructure projects. #mnsen,2020-09-18 16:20:32,Twitter Web App,9,59
COVID-19 is the biggest public health &amp; economic crisis of our lifetime. And while millions of Americans have contracted the virus my opponent has pushed conspiracy theories and downplayed the seriousness of the virus. #mnsen https://t.co/r2TJv0vgVp https://t.co/ToZvrwro0I,2020-09-18 16:16:06,Twitter Media Studio,18,49
In the Senate I’ve championed legislation that’s helped MN’s families during this crisis:  ✅ Free diagnostic COVID testing &amp; vaccine once available ✅ Expanded unemployment benefits ✅ Direct aid to families ✅ Funding for mental health  #mnsen https://t.co/htHWVdcllH,2020-09-18 16:13:49,Twitter Media Studio,9,31
Here’s what I’ve learned: Minnesotans want leaders who will help make their lives work who know how to solve problems who won’t forget them in all the talk. That’s what I’ve done. You know that I’m a doer not a talker. I get things done for you. #mnsen,2020-09-18 16:10:53,Twitter Web App,5,25

7 years ago the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act. Since then we’ve seen Republicans close polling places in predominantly Black &amp; Brown areas implement racist voter ID laws &amp; shut down efforts to restore the law.  It’s no secret: Republicans are suppressing votes.,2020-06-26 02:05:13,Twitter Web App,66,250
Tamir Rice would be 18 years old today if he were alive. But he was shot by Cleveland Police at the age of 12 while playing at a park. He was a child.   The officer still hasn’t been charged. #BlackLivesMatter,2020-06-26 01:33:24,Twitter Web App,53,187

We’re so close to hitting our goal of $10K. Every penny goes to taking on Trump’s attacks in MN. His team just spent SIX FIGURES on a huge ad buy so we’ve got to be ready. Can you pitch in $5 now?  https://t.co/GldoKE6Cm8 https://t.co/VsAGyVoYY7,2020-06-26 00:23:23,Twitter Web App,11,21

At his Tulsa rally Trump said he’s going to have a BIG victory in MN this year. Trump only lost MN by 1.5 pts in 2016 &amp; he just made a SIX FIGURE ad buy. We can’t let Trump flip MN red.

2019 was an historic year in the MN legislature as a record number of Black &amp; Somali-American legislators took office. They created MN’s first United Black Legislative Caucus designed to lift up &amp; address issues Black communities across MN face. #BHM https://t.co/rkxKnb8C4I,2020-02-14 02:56:21,Twitter Web App,19,91

This is great news for Minnesotans. Connectivity is a crucial piece of our everyday lives and I’m proud of the investment we continue to see for broadband infrastructure especially in rural parts of the state. https://t.co/TJqYoC8LTH,2020-02-12 15:52:23,Twitter Web App,20,106
The Senate resumes ~normal~ session this week. What that means: McConnell will continue to push the confirmation of judges and ignore important legislation waiting to be voted on.,2020-02-11 20:04:44,Twitter Web App,46,214
And cuts ALL federal funding for Planned Parenthood - a critical provider of health care for people across the country. This administration will stop at nothing to take away health care and I won’t let this attack stand. https://t.co/qkHAl1FleO,2020-02-11 02:17:37,Twitter for iPhone,70,195
This win happened because students knew the power of their voice and the power of organizing. I’m proud of the students in Worthington who stood up for their values and their right to an education. https://t.co/6EQbdvVdB0,2020-02-07 21:05:10,Twitter Web App,2,26
Farji Shaheer knows the power of his voice &amp; has used it as a force for change in MN. He created the Next Step program working to prevent victims of violent injuries from returning with another injury from a violent crime. #BHM https://t.co/RYxew8NkmD,2020-02-06 21:23:07,Twitter Web App,9,19
From January 2017 to March 2018 1 in 4 meetings Secretary Chao took with local officials were with constituents of her husband Mitch McConnell. I work hard to deliver for Minnesota but I draw the line at marrying the Secretary of Transportation. https://t.co/RgA0ByX0zV,2020-02-06 20:46:19,Twitter Web App,51,131
This process may have let us down. But we must continue to hold onto the values that drive us to find common ground within our communities to organize on the issues that matter most and hold our elected leaders accountable. That matters. Thank you.,2020-02-05 21:44:05,Twitter Web App,3,41
This November we can put our values on the record. Together we can show our leaders will be held accountable. I see more signs of common ground hope and determination in MN than I do the fractures of division distrust and partisanship.,2020-02-05 21:44:05,Twitter Web App,11,60
There is nothing inevitable about democracy it is something we have to fight for. And now the fight for democracy and our Constitution has chosen us. We have a lot of work to do between now and November. Democracy is hard work. But I know you’re up to the task.,2020-02-05 21:44:04,Twitter Web App,1,27
Our duty to defend the Constitution requires action now. When the President solicits foreign nations to influence our elections with disinformation and prevents the public from hearing a full and fair account of that effort we can’t afford to turn a blind eye.,2020-02-05 21:44:04,Twitter Web App,1,29
But a trial without witnesses and evidence is not a real trial. And an acquittal in such a trial is not a real acquittal either.,2020-02-05 21:44:04,Twitter Web App,4,26
The trial wasn’t just about whether a president extorted allies for personal political favors and attempted to cover it up. It was about holding leaders accountable and defending our right to free fair elections. And about the country we want to be and courage to fight for it.,2020-02-05 21:44:03,Twitter Web App,2,24
And when the House sent two articles of impeachment to the Senate I took an oath to “do impartial justice according to the Constitution and the law.” That is an oath I take as seriously as anything I have ever done.,2020-02-05 21:44:03,Twitter Web App,3,31
While I disagree with the President on a lot of issues I believe impeachment should be the last resort. But when I read the whistleblower report alleging nothing less than the President’s corrupt abuse of power we had no choice but to begin an impeachment inquiry.,2020-02-05 21:44:02,Twitter Web App,4,49
I just voted to remove Donald J. Trump from office.,2020-02-05 21:44:02,Twitter Web App,36,1135
#BlackHistoryMonth is about educating ourselves and recognizing the work we must still do - like working to decrease the maternal mortality rate for Black mothers or making sure representation reflects communities. The accountability is on all of us as we pursue justice.,2020-02-05 00:11:34,Twitter for iPhone,7,46
Republicans: “Convince me to be bipartisan. If you can’t convince me YOU are the partisan ones.”  Democrats: “That’s not how this works. 🤔”,2020-01-31 18:00:11,Twitter for iPhone,31,239
We can take back the Senate if we win this Georgia seat (and win in MN!). Join me in supporting @ReverendWarnock so that all voices are heard in Georgia. https://t.co/MXJGdXk2hJ,2020-01-31 15:03:38,Twitter Web App,31,103
Savanna’s Act and the Not Invisible Act will allow better coordination with law enforcement increase violence prevention efforts and expand data collection. They are headed to the Senate floor where I hope they’ll be brought up for a vote as soon as possible.,2020-01-29 15:41:20,Twitter Web App,6,21
This is a crisis. It is wrong it is heartbreaking. I’m proud that the work we are doing together to address it is moving forward. We must get this done for the women in Minnesota and across the country. https://t.co/aO9rQduq9q,2020-01-29 15:41:20,Twitter Web App,12,34
You can donate to make sure we have the resources to take on Trump’s campaign here: https://t.co/7tzLAcBssE,2020-01-28 16:29:21,Twitter Web App,7,28
Trump’s campaign says they’ll have 100 staff here on the ground in Minnesota by summer. We aren’t taking anything for granted — it’s going to take all of us to organize and to stand up for our values to win. https://t.co/BUcWv4HVYJ,2020-01-28 16:29:21,Twitter Web App,18,85
Today #WeRemember the millions of Jews and other people who suffered and were killed because of the hatred of the Nazis. We must keep standing up to the anti-Semitism and bigotry around us because hate has no place here. #HolocaustRemembranceDay,2020-01-27 20:01:15,Twitter Web App,14,65

Roe v. Wade legalized abortion 47 years ago today. It’s an important piece of our health care yet every day your right to choose is still attacked.

Today marks 10 years since the Supreme Court ruled in Citizens United. And 10 years later we see the extreme hold dark money has on our democracy. Now more than ever we must #EndCitizensUnited. @StopBigMoney https://t.co/TI61H1RaCt,2020-01-21 17:20:13,Twitter Web App,30,109
Whatever happens I will fulfill my duty and make a judgment based on my job as a juror charged with providing impartial justice.,2020-01-21 16:05:29,Twitter Web App,8,55
As a member of the Senate I swear an oath to “do impartial justice according to the Constitution and the law” and I take this oath seriously. The Senate must hold a fair trial and that includes witnesses and evidence.,2020-01-21 16:05:28,Twitter Web App,12,45
The House has impeached the President and now the Senate begins a trial to determine if he should be removed from office. My duty to you and our democracy remains the same: To uphold the Constitution and rule of law and the principle that no one is above the law.,2020-01-21 16:05:27,Twitter Web App,4,25
We had no choice but to follow the facts and establish whether the President abused his power and put his own interests ahead of the security of our nation and the rule of law.,2020-01-21 16:05:25,Twitter Web App,4,21
Last fall after learning about the President’s actions to get Ukraine to interfere in our elections for his personal political benefit I came to the decision that the House should begin impeachment proceedings.,2020-01-21 16:05:25,Twitter Web App,4,27
We are living through an historic time. When I was sworn into office as your Senator I took an oath to uphold our Constitution and rule of law.,2020-01-21 16:05:24,Twitter Web App,18,139
Proud that the @nytopinion is recognizing what Minnesotans already knew about @amyklobuchar - she brings people together and gets results. And also important to note when women run for office women win. https://t.co/AA5Bm4oESa,2020-01-20 23:52:14,Twitter for iPhone,41,263

Today let’s not just remember Dr. King’s words but act on them and rededicate ourselves to the struggle - for voting rights for human rights for civil rights and for true equality in our great but imperfect democracy.,2020-01-20 18:36:28,Twitter Web App,2,11
Dr. King understood that the path of progress is not always a straight line. “Progress” he wrote “does not roll in on wheels of inevitability.”,2020-01-20 18:36:28,Twitter Web App,4,12
Happy Birthday Dr. King. Today we pause for a moment to be thankful for the legacy of Dr. King’s work for justice and his dream that all people have the opportunity to live lives defined by freedom and dignity.,2020-01-20 18:36:27,Twitter Web App,2,21
