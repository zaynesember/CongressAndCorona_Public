No way to sugarcoat this.  Republicans are arguing their case before the nation's highest court to wipe away health care for millions in the middle of the greatest public health catastrophe in a century.,2020-11-10 18:21:10,Twitter Web App,154,632
So yes if the Supreme Court strikes down the ACA not only would millions lose their health care but we'd again live in a country where huge companies could force ordinary Americans into bankruptcy to pay for drugs like insulin.   This is what is at stake in this case.,2020-11-10 17:27:28,Twitter Web App,22,79
So I got a law passed that helps make insulin affordable. It was a blow to the profits of big pharmaceutical companies but a win for everyone else.   Here's the problem: a bill like this requires the ACA's framework. If that goes so does this bill.,2020-11-10 17:27:28,Twitter Web App,9,41
I've worked on this issue my entire time in Congress.

As far as I see it DeVos has a choice here she can choose to do her job or not.    If she wants schools to reopen in person safely then she should be working with the Education Department to make it happen. Anything else is an abdication of duty.,2020-10-29 18:51:03,Twitter Web App,15,119
If this sounds like an obvious step to you that's because it is.    Check out what @SenWarren and I wrote to DeVos you can read our full letter at the link below. It explains what all this means in more detail:   https://t.co/rCMMVL5RVB,2020-10-29 18:51:02,Twitter Web App,13,87

This position is good news for DeVos she gets to do less work.

You might be thinking that there is a national effort to track how schools are reopening in person so we can reopen as many as possible safely.    There is not.

I’ve got several bills tackling this problem head on.    The choice between economic growth and curbing emissions has always been a false one. We can create new jobs help our economy and get our country running on clean energy. Really that simple.,2020-09-09 22:45:11,Twitter Web App,8,28
Agreed.   If we don’t pass serious legislation to get our emissions down we risk accelerating environmental catastrophe. https://t.co/QoEREniV5k,2020-09-09 22:45:11,Twitter Web App,11,50

I'll close by saying that this pandemic only exacerbated the childcare crisis. I've been working on this issue my entire time in the Senate—the way we do childcare in this country needs an overhaul.  So let's make sure childcare survives this crisis AND fix the system long-term.,2020-09-09 18:00:24,Twitter Web App,8,54
This isn't just the right thing to do it's also an investment. Working moms contribute a huge amount to our workforce if communities lack childcare we are risking hamstringing our economic recovery.,2020-09-09 18:00:24,Twitter Web App,8,39
With more emergency funding we can avert this crisis. We can allow providers to keep staff on payroll get PPE and get assistance for other expenses needed to make childcare work.  Our bill has 50 billion in funding for this effect.,2020-09-09 18:00:24,Twitter Web App,5,42
I'll touch on number two in this thread. Mass closures are a serious issue. Childcare has always had thin margins and an early survey indicated nearly half of all providers could not survive a two week shutdown.,2020-09-09 18:00:23,Twitter Web App,5,36
Our plan has three pieces.    1) Providing support to providers caring for the children of those fighting this pandemic on the frontlines.  2) Preventing mass permanent closures in the childcare system. 3) Shoring up the system to make it work better in the future.,2020-09-09 18:00:23,Twitter Web App,11,63
Also want to point out this crisis has been particularly hard on working moms. The @NYTimes had a feature on this recently linked it here.   So what can we do to ensure we have a robust childcare system in place when we can return to normal? https://t.co/2KwQvFKKuc,2020-09-09 18:00:23,Twitter Web App,10,50
Before I start I'll just say this issue is personal. Both @SenWarren and I were young moms our kids were always our first priority.   When you’re a working mom you need to feel confident that your kids are safe and cared for.,2020-09-09 18:00:22,Twitter Web App,10,66
Parents raising kids during this pandemic are running into a major problem--our childcare system is at risk of collapsing. We've got two options we can fix this crisis or ignore it.

My bill also establishes a national strategy to combat the use and abuse of cannabis by youth and requires that civil rights advocates get input in the decision making process. This must be at the forefront of our efforts to legalize marijuana.,2020-09-05 15:54:05,Twitter Web App,17,137

Today is the 55th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act now the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. 7 years ago the Supreme Court gutted it.   We need to restore those protections so that every American can vote safely easily and free from discrimination.,2020-08-07 00:49:14,Twitter Web App,45,134

COVID-19's high impact on communities of color has shown just how much health is determined by circumstances and events that take place long before anyone enters a doctor’s office.   Today I’m announcing a bill that ensures we are addressing this in our public health efforts.,2020-08-07 00:06:18,Twitter Web App,8,22
Workers of color disproportionately face retaliation when they report COVID-19 concerns.   I’m with @SenKamalaHarris — the federal government needs to protect all workers from being punished for reporting workplace hazards. https://t.co/GIiZ4TNYkL,2020-08-06 18:46:44,Twitter Web App,85,226

At the end of the day the public overwhelmingly supports legalization but our laws have not kept up. I'm here to say that yes our country can legalize marijuana and do so in a smart commonsense way.

Finally we need to do more research on a scientific standard for detecting marijuana-impaired driving while preventing a repeat of the racist enforcement patterns of The War on Drugs.,2020-08-03 22:33:07,Twitter Web App,11,233
We also need a national strategy to combat the use and abuse of marijuana by kids as well as create safety and quality control standards for how marijuana is grown transported and sold.   Guidelines for all of that are in my bill.,2020-08-03 22:33:06,Twitter Web App,8,190
That means that just like with alcohol and tobacco we need to put the FDA in charge of regulating labeling and advertising.,2020-08-03 22:33:05,Twitter Web App,10,211
Second if we legalize we need to do it the right way.  In addition to passing @SenKamalaHarris’s MORE Act to expunge marijuana-related convictions and reinvest in communities harmed by the War on Drugs we need to ensure legal marijuana is safe regulated and well-researched.,2020-08-03 22:33:05,Twitter Web App,32,343

What can you say about a President who needs to teargas people so he can go out on the street? And now he’s building a wall around the White House and amplifying people calling the protestors terrorists so he doesn’t hear America’s voices.

I’m glad that Congress has passed another bill to help small businesses stay afloat. But there’s a lot more we have to do.

Congress created $8B Emergency Tribal Relief Fund to help Tribal governments respond to COVID-19. Today the Trump Admin said they will distribute this $ in part to Alaska Native corporations that are NOT Tribal gov’ts. This betrays Congressional intent &amp; betrays Tribal nations. https://t.co/xhvbJQmHLg,2020-04-23 22:08:38,Twitter for iPhone,209,413
Childcare providers are some of our country's greatest heroes in the fight against COVID-19. They're enabling health care workers and other essential employees w/ kids to go to work.

State and federal partners and health care systems working together for public health and our economy—MN is showing how we do that.

UPDATE: Today I helped the Senate pass a relief package which will provide $370B in emergency loans and grants for hard-hit small businesses in MN &amp; across the country. It also targets $75B to help hospitals handle the surge in infections and $25B to improve testing capabilities.,2020-04-21 23:23:25,Twitter for iPhone,17,118
This weekend I told @CNN's @FWhitfield that many small businesses have weeks not months to survive an emergency like this pandemic.

Nope not an accurate characterization @WSJopinion. And good news! Trump heard the Democrats &amp; is moving in our direction for the good of small business hospitals &amp; improved testing.

I've heard directly from MN Tribal leaders abt the devastating economic impact of COVID-19. Tribal gov'ts made the difficult decision to close Tribal enterprises like casinos but this has been doubly damaging to Tribes bc of loss of jobs &amp; loss of income for basic govt services.,2020-04-17 17:33:20,Twitter Web App,17,55
The CARES Act provides $8 billion in critical relief to Tribal governments so they can respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. But the Trump Admin is already signaling that it is putting for-profit corporations ahead of Tribal governments and Tribal members. https://t.co/lhwbh4mUWu,2020-04-17 17:33:20,Twitter Web App,41,55
This shouldn’t need clarification yet it bears repeating for the Trump Admin: Congress fought for $8 billion to help Tribal gov'ts continue to provide essential services for Native people during this pandemic and we intended that these resources would go only to helping Tribes.,2020-04-17 17:33:20,Twitter Web App,207,574

No votes in the U.S. Senate today. It’s been over two days since the House passed legislation to support families during #COVIDー19. @Senatemajldr we should have stayed in session to get it done. Even Trump supports this bill we need action.,2020-03-17 01:15:36,Twitter Web App,82,297

Congress’ first &amp; foremost priority should be helping families during this COVID-19 pandemic. I’m using my voice to call on @senatemajldr to convene the Senate so we can pass emergency COVID-19 legislation. House passed the bill and Senate should too. Your voices are strong too.,2020-03-14 15:35:09,Twitter for iPhone,39,177
Our number one priority must be to keep Minnesotans safe as we work to contain and prevent spread of the coronavirus.  I support @GovTimWalz's decision today. This unprecedented time requires action.   https://t.co/Zr43uUdI5X,2020-03-13 19:47:44,Twitter Web App,10,57

My other bill would ensure that no person—with or without insurance—incurs cost-sharing when receiving a test to confirm a COVID-19 infection.

Trump has obstructed efforts to contain &amp; suppress coronavirus &amp; has misled ppl about how serious it is.

The truth is that I see more signs of common ground hope and determination in Minnesota than I do the fractures of division distrust and partisanship. That is a foundation for us all to build on going forward. (7/7),2020-02-05 21:43:00,Twitter Web App,3,51
After this vote the work of reinforcing the American values of fairness and justice will continue. We have a lot of work to do but democracy is hard work and I know that Minnesotans are up to it. (6/7),2020-02-05 21:43:00,Twitter Web App,3,39
There is nothing inevitable about democracy. It’s not a natural state it’s a state we have to fight for. The fight for democracy and our Constitution has chosen us in this moment and it’s our job to rise to the moment. (5/7),2020-02-05 21:42:59,Twitter Web App,8,48
Now we go forward. This trial has changed us but it doesn’t change the core value of America that no one is above the law including and most especially the President. (4/7),2020-02-05 21:42:58,Twitter Web App,3,31
I've asked myself whether I'd have voted to remove a President of my own party had they abused their power for personal political benefit damaging our elections &amp; nat'l security in the process. It’s easy to say yes when the choice is hypothetical.  But the answer is yes. (3/7),2020-02-05 21:42:58,Twitter Web App,4,49
It was not a suspenseful moment but if felt as weighty as when I first raised my right hand and pledged to provide impartial justice. I know that is what I did. (2/7),2020-02-05 21:42:57,Twitter Web App,3,36
Last day.   Today Senators filed onto the floor of the United States Senate for the last time in this trial of impeachment. One  by one we voted twice on whether President Trump should be removed from office. (1/7),2020-02-05 21:42:57,Twitter Web App,19,116
If we say that the president can decide when he cooperates with a congressional investigation we are saying he’s above the law. https://t.co/G94zgs5JpL,2020-02-05 20:25:59,Twitter Media Studio,38,188
I’m in tears. “My promise before God to apply impartial justice requires I put my personal feelings and political biases to the side.”   @SenatorRomney shows us what duty and patriotism looks like.,2020-02-05 19:13:25,Twitter Web App,75,555
(4/4) Minnesotans and Americans want a President committed to putting his words into action which this President has failed to do when it comes to health care.,2020-02-05 03:45:03,Twitter for iPhone,7,23
(3/4) Tonight President Trump talked about bringing health care costs down but at the same time his administration is fighting in court to repeal the Affordable Care Act kick people off of health insurance and take away protections for people with pre-existing conditions.,2020-02-05 03:45:02,Twitter for iPhone,11,31

(2/3) I have a lot of questions but first among them is this: why are the President’s lawyers opposed to witnesses and documents?   Why would the Senate not want John Bolton to testify under oath? Why would we oppose asking Mick Mulvaney to tell us what he knows?,2020-01-28 22:50:57,Twitter Web App,19,74

(5/5) Lawyers really doubled down on Hunter Biden &amp; went so far as to say that Obama should have been impeached using House standard. Honestly it was bizarre. Their close was more like a preview of political ads this fall—both negative &amp; positive. The message was not too subtle.,2020-01-28 00:53:47,Twitter for iPhone,6,49
(4/5) Makes it even more clear that we must have witnesses &amp; documents to have fair trial. I don’t see how a member of the Senate could refuse to hear Bolton testify under oath now that we know something about what’s out there. This information will come out—why not hear it now?,2020-01-28 00:53:47,Twitter for iPhone,5,49
(3/5) It was also surreal to have no discussion at all of the big news this weekend that Bolton in his manuscript apparently makes it clear that the President did want an investigation into the Bidens and the 2016 election in exchange for releasing the aid.,2020-01-28 00:53:46,Twitter for iPhone,4,31
(2/5) Was surreal to see Kenneth Starr review history and precedent of impeachment. One of his points was that we have been in what he called an age of impeachment that we should leave behind.

(6/6) On the good side the President’s lawyers were civil and measured which I think will help us all listen with the “empathetic attentiveness” that the Senate Chaplin has encouraged.  It will be good to have a day or so to think on all this and clear my head for next week.,2020-01-25 23:42:00,Twitter for iPhone,9,51
(5/6) I’ve never been a member of a jury before—I’ve never even been called for jury duty. But it never dawned on me that my 1st trial would be in the U.S. Senate &amp; it would not include even this most basic element—witnesses &amp; ability for both sides to cross examine witnesses.,2020-01-25 23:41:59,Twitter for iPhone,15,62
(4/6) If the President’s lawyers really believe the witnesses we’ve heard from so far don’t have all the facts about what happened here why not hear from the witnesses and see the documents that could clear all this up? I don’t think this question is going to go away.,2020-01-25 23:41:59,Twitter for iPhone,20,45
(3/6) What was interesting to me is how their presentation makes the case even stronger for why this trial needs witnesses and the documents.,2020-01-25 23:41:59,Twitter for iPhone,9,38

I can’t comment on the content of the document. What I can say is classifying a document solely because it contains embarrassing or damaging information is not a good reason.  I’m heading back on the floor for another several hours.,2020-01-24 01:43:26,Twitter for iPhone,33,140
One other thing: This morning before the Trial started I reviewed a classified document with a statement from Vice President Pence’s senior aide describing a telephone conversation between the Vice President and Ukrainian President Zelensky.,2020-01-24 01:43:26,Twitter for iPhone,16,64
The White House lawyers argue in their 171-page brief that abuse of power is not impeachable. Let’s just say it’s hard to find a legal expert to support their position. But we’ll learn more about that when they begin their presentation.,2020-01-24 01:43:25,Twitter for iPhone,11,38
The House managers provided an excellent review of the constitutional rationale history and precedent for impeachment for a President’s abuse of power. Even my colleagues with law degrees found it fascinating and full of good information.,2020-01-24 01:43:25,Twitter for iPhone,8,41
Little more than halfway through Day #3. The Senate Chaplin began his opening prayer by urging us not just to hear but to also practice empathetic attentiveness. &amp; to remember our friendships in the Senate. The Chaplin can always be counted on to appeal to our higher principles.,2020-01-24 01:43:25,Twitter for iPhone,22,114
Lastly I will say that watching the tapes of the President INVITING foreign interference in our elections—including from China—I asked myself “is this a big deal?”  And I’ve come to the conclusion that yes it is a very big deal.,2020-01-23 01:25:16,Twitter for iPhone,18,105

2) It’s compelling to see how many facts link to Russia—the false theory that Ukraine and not Russia interfered in our 2016 election; how withholding aid weakened Ukraine in its fight with Russia; and how Russia interfered in the 2016 election to benefit Donald Trump; and,2020-01-23 01:25:15,Twitter for iPhone,6,37
1) The facts aren’t really in dispute. Even the President’s lawyers haven’t challenged them so far.,2020-01-23 01:25:15,Twitter for iPhone,6,39
The House managers’ presentation led by Congressman Adam Schiff was a strong summation of the facts and the core issues the Senate faces. Now the House managers are plowing through the timeline and key facts. We aren’t done for today just yet but here are my thoughts:,2020-01-23 01:25:15,Twitter for iPhone,5,26
I’m keeping notes in a red notebook—kind of a stream of consciousness of quotes observations and things to remember. I’m starting to think about questions I want to ask.,2020-01-23 01:25:15,Twitter for iPhone,2,33
Day 2 after a long night yesterday and you can feel people settling into this new world of hours sitting on the Senate floor listening and taking notes. And maybe a catnap or two (not naming names).,2020-01-23 01:25:15,Twitter for iPhone,12,102
And THEN graciously allow a debate on whether witnesses should be called even though the trial is basically over. All the while talk about fairness and hope America doesn’t notice.  I think America is noticing.,2020-01-22 16:18:32,Twitter Web App,37,183
Based on how things went yesterday here’s Mitch McConnell's plan for how to hold an impeachment trial:      First tell the prosecution that they can’t call any witnesses.  Not any. Tell them to argue their case and then let the jury (that’s us) ask questions.,2020-01-22 16:18:31,Twitter Web App,42,125
3) McConnell's move to table seems designed to protect his members from a "no" vote on including documents and witnesses for this trial but I bet Americans will see what's really happening here.,2020-01-22 00:36:27,Twitter Web App,26,73
I’m thinking as I’m writing this:  1) We should be rigorously prepared.  2) We shouldn’t be afraid of the facts and…,2020-01-22 00:36:26,Twitter Web App,11,48

The President's lawyers seemed to be speaking to an audience of one. On questions of whether the Senate should call for witnesses and documents they talked about Mueller Pelosi and Schiff.  Sometimes it came off as a bit incoherent. They read from notes and seemed unprepared.,2020-01-22 00:36:26,Twitter Web App,10,39
The House managers today relentlessly plowed through questions about witnesses and documents and asked us essentially "Why WOULDN'T you want to know this? Why WOULDN'T you want to see the documents?"  I agree.,2020-01-22 00:36:26,Twitter Web App,13,63
