The US works with allies to broker a deal capping Iran’s nuclear program far below weapons grade. Iran complies with deal but Trump blows it up.

I voted not to confirm Judge Barrett to the Supreme Court.

The GOP has tried for ten years to destroy the ACA in the Administration in Congress and in the Courts. They even engineered a complete shutdown of the American government in the fall of 2013. But they have failed—and in Judge Barrett they see one final chance.,2020-10-26 13:15:32,Twitter Web App,61,601

The GOP Senate majority abandoned their commitment to helping Americans through this emergency on September 18—the day that Ruth Bader Ginsburg died. And since then rushing Judge Barrett to confirmation has been all that matters to them.,2020-10-26 13:15:32,Twitter Web App,65,391

Dr. Fauci agreed with me that: 1) US death rate is unacceptable. 2) The US needs to do better. 3) Access to health care keeps people safer.  Meanwhile Trump is still doing all he can to dismantle the Affordable Care Act and take away health care from tens of millions of people. https://t.co/ZoLP9eWz8v,2020-05-12 16:52:19,Twitter for iPhone,718,2017
I’m looking forward to asking questions of Dr. Fauci today.

We all know by now the President doesn’t have a real plan for national testing.

President Trump’s veto exposes two things:  1. He doesn’t understand the Constitution that he’s sworn to uphold and protect.  2.

America is afflicted by a President who delights in division cruelty lies and chaos. We deserve better in the Oval Office. In Virginia's primary I will proudly vote for @JoeBiden. Joe has exemplary heart character and experience—and he’s a leader our kids can look up to.,2020-02-28 15:36:23,Twitter Web App,7676,30458
At the same time that health officials are requesting additional emergency funding for the CDC to prepare for the threat of the coronavirus President Trump is proposing budget cuts to the CDC WHO and NIH. We need to listen to the experts not defund them.,2020-02-27 22:01:03,Twitter for iPhone,282,950
One year ago today the House passed #HR8 legislation that requires a background check for every firearm sale. More than 90% of Americans support this—it’s common sense. But it has yet to be brought up for a vote in the Senate. That’s shameful. We should vote without delay.,2020-02-27 19:14:55,Twitter for iPhone,223,805

@JeffFlake @SenMikeLee Thanks Jeff. Grateful for your partnership over the years on this important issue.,2020-02-13 22:52:42,Twitter for iPhone,3,31
This is a strong bipartisan message from the Senate that we will uphold our constitutional duty to deliberate and vote before sending our troops into harm’s way. https://t.co/oah5xRqNp4,2020-02-13 19:17:28,Twitter Web App,217,1123
About to vote on our resolution that affirms we shouldn’t be at war without a vote of Congress.   We owe this to our troops and their families.,2020-02-13 18:38:37,Twitter Web App,124,977
As the father of a Marine and as a Senator from a state full of active duty servicemembers reservists veterans and military families of all kinds this is personal to me. The list of war’s consequences is long and those who serve risk everything. We owe them this. https://t.co/SiqmV1IOJs,2020-02-13 18:23:24,Twitter Web App,80,382
It's deeply unfair to our troops to allow perpetual war to continue on autopilot. Our resolution says: no war unless you come and make the case to Congress first. If we’re not even willing to have that debate we shouldn’t be forcing people to risk their lives.,2020-02-13 15:17:44,Twitter for iPhone,99,515
The Senate just voted to move forward with a vote on our war powers resolution. This bill sends a very powerful message to the American public—including our troops and their families—that before we get into a war there will be careful deliberation about whether it’s necessary.,2020-02-12 20:06:41,Twitter for iPhone,166,980
I’m glad @JerryMoran will be supporting our bipartisan bill to prevent unilateral war—Congress has got to reassert our constitutional role in matters of war and peace. https://t.co/c5eFUD49ml,2020-02-12 16:41:40,Twitter for iPhone,65,269
I urge all those in the path of flooding in SWVA to stay as safe as possible and visit https://t.co/GfQ1iUudaq for more information.

I'm so glad to see Virginia pass this important legislation. I hope we will follow suit in the Senate and pass the Equality Act in short order. LGBTQ Americans deserve protection from discrimination at the federal level. https://t.co/Lz9AX2Z2lO,2020-02-06 22:27:50,Twitter Web App,125,739
President Trump is going to be acquitted. But let's be clear: an acquittal is not an exoneration. The refusal to allow witnesses and documents—to engineer a sham rather than a trial—will put an asterisk by today in the history books.,2020-02-05 20:50:33,Twitter for iPhone,582,2620
Unchallenged evil spreads like a virus. We have allowed a toxic President to infect the Senate and warp its behavior. An acquittal will lead to worse conduct. I will not be part of this continual degradation of public trust. Thus I will vote to convict President Trump.,2020-02-04 19:30:12,Twitter for iPhone,659,3462

Some Senators will vote to acquit the President on the ground that removal from office is wrong this close to election. Their argument—let the people decide. But if that’s their view why cover up the evidence so that the people cannot see it?,2020-02-01 16:36:31,Twitter for iPhone,616,2649
So it’s a sham. https://t.co/Vi3cVjuf3j,2020-02-01 01:46:15,Twitter for iPhone,255,1470
It's not just lawyers who know that real trials involve documents and witnesses. Any American who's seen Law &amp; Order knows what goes on in a courtroom. And if we don't vote to allow documents and witnesses today it's not a trial — it's a sham.,2020-01-31 15:16:22,Twitter for iPhone,275,1256
If the Senate acquits the President on Article 2 after he violated both the Impoundment Control Act and the Whistleblower Act to hide the Ukraine scheme from Congress what is to stop President Trump from complete refusal to cooperate with Congress on any matter?,2020-01-30 23:40:42,Twitter for iPhone,477,1735
I've had trials in the Richmond traffic court and I had cases in the U.S. Supreme Court. I had trials that lasted an hour and I had trials that lasted weeks. Not once in 17 years did I ever have a trial where there were not witnesses or documents. Not once.,2020-01-29 20:56:12,Twitter for iPhone,490,2135

Trump’s lawyers said cross-examination of witnesses is “the greatest legal engine ever invented for the discovery of truth.”  If that’s true why would they push forward with a trial without witnesses and documents? Are they afraid we will discover the truth?,2020-01-25 18:32:24,Twitter for iPhone,352,1290
But more importantly it suggests to me that they are afraid of what is in those documents. And they are afraid of what the witnesses will say in testimony. And that should tell the American public something.,2020-01-25 02:17:54,Twitter for iPhone,117,645
The fact that the White House was so adamant against producing any documents and that the Republican majority has so far stood against the presentation of the full evidentiary record suggests that it’s not really a fair trial.,2020-01-25 02:17:53,Twitter for iPhone,88,474
We’re either interested in finding the facts or we’re not; we’re either interested in the truth or we’re not. I do not believe that an impeachment trial should operate at a lesser standard than a trial in a traffic court in the city of Richmond—but that's where we are right now.,2020-01-25 02:17:53,Twitter for iPhone,54,279
I’ve taken an oath to do impartial justice and I’m going to keep an open mind until the proceedings are done. But I'm disappointed that my colleagues have yet to embrace what anyone who’s been in any courtroom understands: you can’t have a trial without witnesses and documents.,2020-01-25 02:17:53,Twitter for iPhone,33,292
As jurors we're grappling with 3 questions:  1. What are the facts? 2. Do the facts establish either or both of the articles of impeachment? 3. If they do did they establish them at such a level—a high crime or misdemeanor—to warrant removal of the President from office?,2020-01-25 02:17:52,Twitter for iPhone,24,197
As a lawyer I had cases in every court from the Richmond traffic court to the U.S. Supreme Court. I know courtrooms front back and center. And now I'm a juror for the first time in my life.
