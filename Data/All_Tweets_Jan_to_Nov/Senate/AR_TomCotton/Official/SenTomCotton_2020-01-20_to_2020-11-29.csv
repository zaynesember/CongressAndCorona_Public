Abraham Lincoln warned of the dangers of mob rule:  It endangers livelihoods and property—but it also erodes the American people's faith in their own government.  Mob vigilantes must be stopped and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.  https://t.co/N6Rbur0fAs,2020-06-22 23:18:44,Twitter Web App,494,1216

Lincoln said “There is no grievance that is a fit object of redress by mob law.”   We cannot tolerate mob rule and we cannot allow it to go unpunished.

The mob doesn’t stop at statues. Rioters have torched police precincts &amp; low-income housing.   Churches and synagogues have not been spared.

Well look at that. The Chinese Communist Party’s propaganda rag finally admits what I’ve said for a month: coronavirus didn’t start in Wuhan food market. So where did it originate? Time for answers from CCP. https://t.co/UTvcjvrHNz,2020-02-22 20:15:32,Twitter for iPhone,9749,16193

And of course don’t miss Walter Russell Mead’s opinion column on the “brittle” nature of Chinese power.   The CCP’s propagandists have been storming about this column for two weeks. That’s because it hits the mark: https://t.co/gwSTl2geWO,2020-02-19 21:50:17,Twitter Web App,489,673
.@JoshChin is deputy bureau chief of the WSJ. The CCP doesn’t want you to read his report on China’s repressive surveillance tactics powered by American tech: https://t.co/KdWqlK5i9Z,2020-02-19 21:50:16,Twitter Web App,314,436

Coronavirus spiraled out of control because of the Chinese Communist Party’s secrecy and paranoia so naturally the CCP is responding by kicking out foreign journalists. https://t.co/rpPA7NcG6D,2020-02-19 19:42:13,Twitter Web App,508,1049
Dr. Li Wenliang tried to warn China about coronavirus; the CCP forced him to recant. WSJ publishes a strong opinion piece on coronavirus; the CCP kicks out its journalists.   See a trend?

Congress can do more to secure the release of hostages like Majd and Austin Tice while preventing future kidnappings by passing the Global Hostage Act.

The Chinese Communist Party's dishonesty caused the coronavirus outbreak to spiral out of control. Now it has chosen dishonesty yet again by kicking out foreign journalists over a fake provocation.,2020-02-19 15:25:02,Twitter Web App,1901,3868
She called the lab-release possibility a "tale" &amp; a "conspiracy theory." If she'd done her job she'd know that experts don’t actually rule out a lab incident as the origin.   No wonder the public has lost faith in the @nytimes.   https://t.co/e1hejJniXb,2020-02-18 23:47:29,Twitter for iPhone,365,1069
.@nytimes "reporter" @jotted lied when she said that I claimed the Wuhan coronavirus was a "Chinese bioweapon run amok" (her words not mine). I simply said we couldn't rule out any possibility yet for the virus' origin including a laboratory accident. https://t.co/e0N9uMCPZg,2020-02-18 23:47:29,Twitter for iPhone,799,2106
WaPo’s own expert said he could not rule out that the virus' spread was the result of a "lab incident” and acknowledged the lab had similar types of coronavirus on hand.  @washingtonpost should retract or risk furthering their descent into fake news.  https://t.co/e1hejJniXb,2020-02-18 22:30:25,Twitter Web App,324,845
When I said we couldn't rule out any explanation yet for the Wuhan coronavirus' origin @washingtonpost claimed I was repeating "conspiracy theories" that experts had "debunked."   Wrong.   https://t.co/UelHCYm10f,2020-02-18 22:30:25,Twitter Web App,836,2179
China Daily and similar outlets will now have to disclose what we’ve known all along: they’re state-sponsored propaganda factories for the Chinese Communist Party. https://t.co/GTLsfAacWi,2020-02-18 20:02:57,Twitter for iPhone,1177,1825
And given Chinese dishonesty and lack of transparency we have to consider all possibilities until the evidence is in. But sure @jotted you take the Chinese Communist Party line at face value.,2020-02-17 14:34:12,Twitter for iPhone,271,968
I haven’t said the coronavirus is “a Chinese bioweapon run amok” so I haven’t “walked back” anything. What I have said is that China’s official origin story of the Wuhan food market is almost certainly bogus.,2020-02-17 14:34:12,Twitter for iPhone,352,1178
If @jotted took the time to actually listen to what I’ve said she wouldn’t embarrass herself so badly. Instead she spouts the party line—the Communist Party line. https://t.co/2vu7B4JQPy,2020-02-17 14:34:12,Twitter for iPhone,628,1733
We ought to be transparent with the American people about all this. Maybe some of these so-called experts think they know better. I don’t. And they really don’t either.,2020-02-17 00:33:22,Twitter for iPhone,282,1112
Again none of these are “theories” and certainly not “conspiracy theories.” They are hypotheses that ought to be studied in light of the evidence if the Chinese Communist Party would provide it.,2020-02-17 00:33:22,Twitter for iPhone,301,1141
4. Deliberate release (very unlikely but shouldn’t rule out till the evidence is in),2020-02-17 00:33:22,Twitter for iPhone,171,700
3. Bad science bad safety (this is the engineered-bioweapon hypothesis with an accidental breach),2020-02-17 00:33:21,Twitter for iPhone,159,663
2. Good science bad safety (eg they were researching things like diagnostic testing and vaccines but an accidental breach occurred),2020-02-17 00:33:21,Twitter for iPhone,148,575
1. Natural (still the most likely but almost certainly not from the Wuhan food market),2020-02-17 00:33:21,Twitter for iPhone,143,587
Let me debunk the debunkers. @paulina_milla and her “experts” wrongly jump straight to the claim that the coronavirus is an engineered bioweapon. That’s not what I’ve said. There’s at least four hypotheses about the origin of the virus: https://t.co/536ygN1gC7,2020-02-17 00:33:20,Twitter for iPhone,808,1803
The right policy is to be transparent with our people and examine all possible hypotheses at this point.,2020-02-16 23:43:18,Twitter for iPhone,462,1663
Again this “expert” and I don’t really disagree about the science only about the response to our limited knowledge at this point. And that response is not a scientific question it’s a policy question.,2020-02-16 23:43:18,Twitter for iPhone,332,1272
Because of the CCP’s lies we don’t know where this coronavirus originated though we do almost certainly know it wasn’t in the Wuhan food market.,2020-02-16 23:43:18,Twitter for iPhone,486,1545
Second of course we should “mention” the possibility to our people—doing otherwise will breed distrust in our government. A central lesson of past outbreaks (SARS MERS Ebola etc) is to be honest about what we know and what we don’t know.,2020-02-16 23:43:17,Twitter for iPhone,355,1238
But given the CCP’s ongoing dishonesty we have to examine the hypothesis and demand the evidence.,2020-02-16 23:43:17,Twitter for iPhone,211,840
First it’s not a “ theory” and certainly not a “conspiracy theory” but rather a hypothesis—one among many all but one of which will ultimately be disproven by the evidence if the Chinese Communist Party ever shares it.,2020-02-16 23:43:17,Twitter for iPhone,527,1846
.@jaketapper This unnamed “expert” says it’s “possible” that coronavirus originated in Wuhan super lab we “just don’t know how probable.” I agree. Yet he calls it a “conspiracy theory” that we shouldn’t “mention.” I couldn’t disagree more. He’s wrong on two counts. https://t.co/o5fGkkTu2u,2020-02-16 23:43:17,Twitter for iPhone,2188,5322

Good morning. There was a 28% increase in coronavirus cases overnight in China. Make no mistake though: these aren’t “new” cases. Just what China is willing to admit. It’s much worse.,2020-01-30 13:03:46,Twitter for iPhone,1131,2212

"A tour-bus driver in Japan" got coronavirus after driving tourists from Wuhan.  Do you think those tourists kissed the bus driver as they disembarked? Me neither.  Coronavirus may be aerosolized.

China admits to 6000 cases of coronavirus. China is LYING! The real number is likely many times greater and probably growing fast. https://t.co/meiuvLhIDZ,2020-01-30 00:24:11,Twitter Web App,715,1387
World Health Organization made a terrible mistake last week by not declaring this coronavirus a global health emergency.  The WHO must reverse this decision immediately. https://t.co/fuC0iUA0UV,2020-01-30 00:16:48,Twitter Web App,188,419
As the administration weighs options to stop the spread of coronavirus to the United States I hope our health officials will keep Benjamin Franklin’s old adage in mind: An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.  https://t.co/nLs1LLtxPy,2020-01-29 23:58:13,Twitter Web App,81,256
China but also Germany Japan Vietnam Taiwan: all countries with person-to-person transmission of coronavirus. Meanwhile flights from China are landing in the US every hour. This has to stop.,2020-01-29 22:50:28,Twitter Web App,315,1004
I certainly hope this isn’t true—need to deploy full weight of U.S. government to this effort. In the meantime we need a China travel ban. https://t.co/pNihIkNHt5,2020-01-29 21:40:36,Twitter Web App,89,234

China's government restricts information about outbreaks to control its citizens. During the 2003 SARS outbreak restricting crucial information proved deadly.

Airlines are cutting flights to China. It’s not enough. The best way to stop the Wuhan coronavirus from spreading is a targeted travel ban.   https://t.co/VygHF3fwmT,2020-01-29 19:23:58,Twitter Web App,122,298
Thankfully these Americans made it out but many are still stuck in China’s quarantine zone. We must work quickly to screen monitor and bring back our citizens. https://t.co/UzWsoqF6kv,2020-01-29 18:51:21,Twitter Web App,39,174
Keeping the Chinese Communist Party out of our research laboratories is a crucial act of self defense. It’s unforgivable for U.S. citizens to aid foreign adversaries in stealing American intellectual property. https://t.co/cEmEp3fUtV,2020-01-28 20:21:37,Twitter for iPhone,787,1154

The short-term savings aren’t worth the long-term costs. In light of this decision the U.S. Director of National Intelligence should conduct a thorough review of U.S.-UK intelligence-sharing.,2020-01-28 15:13:23,Twitter Web App,73,231
Allowing Huawei to the build the UK’s 5G networks today is like allowing the KGB to build its telephone network during the Cold War. The CCP will now have a foothold to conduct pervasive espionage on British society and has increased economic and political leverage over the UK.,2020-01-28 15:13:23,Twitter Web App,158,370
This decision is deeply disappointing for American supporters of the Special Relationship. I fear London has freed itself from Brussels only to cede sovereignty to Beijing. https://t.co/JBU4ARQLjs,2020-01-28 15:13:23,Twitter Web App,500,743

Thousands circumvent our immigration process each year through fraudulent ‘birth tourism’ visits &amp; @StateDept is right to crack down on this sham.

The 2015 WOTUS rule was a vast and vague expansion of federal regulation.

The CCP is once again keeping the world in the dark about a deadly outbreak. This harmful approach will only ensure the virus spreads further.
