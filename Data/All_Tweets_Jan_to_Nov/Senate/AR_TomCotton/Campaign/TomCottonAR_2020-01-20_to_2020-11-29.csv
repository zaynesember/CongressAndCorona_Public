Congress approved border fencing with bipartisan support in '06 including from Sen. Schumer and then-Senators Clinton Obama and Biden.   Physical barriers help secure the border. It's common sense and objective fact.   Asserting it today gets you censored by @Twitter.,2020-10-29 17:51:29,Twitter Web App,43,154
Perhaps Twitter thinks it's "hateful" to suggest that border walls can be effective enforcement tools? That walls work is just another fact. Here's an example from a longtime DHS official who served under Bush Obama and Trump: https://t.co/qM6novrh2Z,2020-10-29 17:51:29,Twitter Web App,47,161
Even Twitter wouldn't say it's "hateful conduct" to assert drugs are illegally smuggled across the border right?   The government seized more than 2321kg of heroin at the southwest border in 2018 alone. https://t.co/S33xYa7tS5,2020-10-29 17:51:28,Twitter Web App,6,33
Maybe Twitter is saying that sexual predators aren't trying to enter the country illegally and suggesting that they are is somehow "hateful conduct"?   Here's an example of sex offenders trying to cross illegally: https://t.co/qeIgPFts8W,2020-10-29 17:51:28,Twitter Web App,7,32
Or maybe Twitter thinks it's "hateful conduct" to suggest that "murderers" try to enter the United States illegally? But that is also factual. https://t.co/ZAawI0fVBC,2020-10-29 17:51:28,Twitter Web App,10,34

What about @CBPMarkMorgan's censored tweet was either hateful or false? Is the problem the suggestion that "gang members" try to cross illegally into the United States? Because that's a fact. https://t.co/CFGhZPPrgH,2020-10-29 17:51:27,Twitter Web App,88,248

Now @Nytimes is claiming my piece was "contemptuous".   Hey @nytimes—publishing the case for pedophilia was contemptuous towards children families and all decent people.   But you did it.   Will A.G.

Before @nytimes invents some new excuse to cover for their surrender of journalistic integrity to the woke mob here's the real story of how my op-ed got published.   https://t.co/u91l7sE15T,2020-06-05 11:13:13,Twitter Web App,534,1241
My view:   Support peaceful protests.   Stop violence and looting.   If police are overwhelmed by violence military backup is a lawful &amp; appropriate last resort with historical precedent.   @NYTimes apologized for publishing this view supported by a large majority of Americans?,2020-06-05 11:10:40,Twitter Web App,333,1116
Now @nytimes is having a "virtual walkout" for publishing my view that as a last resort it's appropriate &amp; lawful for our military to backup police to stop violence and save lives.

It’s true I had some milk with my chocolate.  I guess I could’ve added vodka &amp; had a White Russian (minus the Kahlua). But @RepAdamSchiff probably would’ve accused me of collusion. https://t.co/JY4ca2oMUe,2020-01-22 22:27:22,Twitter for iPhone,108,617
