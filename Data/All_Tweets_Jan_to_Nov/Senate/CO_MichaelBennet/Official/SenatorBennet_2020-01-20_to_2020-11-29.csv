It is common these days to observe that our institutions are failing. But they don’t fail on their own. It takes people to destroy them.

The purpose of direct action Dr. King reminds us is “to create such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue.”   That’s what happened in Colorado when we became the first state to pass police accountability reform.,2020-08-28 20:00:06,Twitter Web App,8,36

As I’ve traveled across CO this month I’ve seen farmers continue to find new ways to improve soil health and conserve water––two key ingredients for a sustainable farm.

@SenAngusKing @RepDeanPhillips #RCV is no silver bullet for our political dysfunction but it is precisely the kind of bold and innovative reform we should consider to restore and reinvigorate our democracy.   That’s why we need the #VoterChoiceAct.,2020-02-27 19:07:17,TweetDeck,13,79

@SenAngusKing @RepDeanPhillips #RCV lets voters pick their first choice without accidentally helping elect their last choice –  increasing political competition and bringing new voices into our politics.

@SenAngusKing @RepDeanPhillips In most elections you vote for one person and the person with the most votes wins. Downside? Candidates can win without earning a majority of all votes.

The arguments from the president's team reflect their utter contempt for the American people and our Constitution.   They don't think you're paying attention. We must prove them wrong.,2020-01-30 20:55:15,TweetDeck,315,1352
No fancy lawyering can obscure these truths:   The American people alone decide our elections.   Foreign election interference is a crime.   Asking for foreign interference to help your reelection is an abuse of power. https://t.co/trUd0AgwNF,2020-01-30 17:29:42,TweetDeck,164,558
The argument that a president can abuse their power to get reelected and just claim it's in the "public interest" should shock us all.  It's an affront to the very idea of limited government checks &amp; balances and the rule of law.   Where are the "Constitutional conservatives"?,2020-01-30 15:15:52,TweetDeck,389,1648

That is completely consistent with their incoherent arguments in this case. But it's completely inconsistent with our history and any constitutional argument I’ve ever encountered.   And it shows the degree to which this has been an all-out cover up by the president’s men.,2020-01-30 02:48:28,TweetDeck,78,350
Having ignored a critical law to protect whistleblowers who come forward to report wrongdoing in government...  Having attacked the whistleblower as a traitor and a spy...

Thanks @CancerResrch for your advocacy! And glad the House @EnergyCommerce Committee is holding a hearing on our MODERN Labeling Act.

@RepJoeNeguse But our work is far from over.    Now that the #COREAct has passed the House let’s honor the decade-long effort behind this bill with action in the Senate.     Colorado has waited long enough.  https://t.co/J3NX5RAqOS,2020-01-28 17:43:23,TweetDeck,11,52
Today marks 1 year since @RepJoeNeguse and I introduced the #COREAct to protect our public lands and boost our economy.    The success we've had over the past year wouldn't have been possible without the Coloradans who worked for years on this bill.,2020-01-28 17:42:36,TweetDeck,28,193

My mom thought her parents were dead until they came to find her after the war. They had lost everything except each other. They knew how lucky they had been to survive the Holocaust but that luck was colored by the memories of all and everyone they had lost.,2020-01-27 23:25:16,TweetDeck,24,179
These lessons are personal for me. My mother and her parents were Polish Jews who survived the Holocaust. When the Nazis invaded Poland my mom was sent to hide in a village. My grandmother lived as a Catholic in a convent. My grandfather hid in the cellar of a candy-maker.,2020-01-27 23:23:56,TweetDeck,22,131
The lesson of the Holocaust is that unchallenged hate can soon become unspeakable evil. It is not enough for us to remember #Auschwitz one day a year. We honor those who died by recommitting daily to fight bigotry and the cynical belief that we are powerless against injustice.,2020-01-27 23:22:12,TweetDeck,99,430
In Colorado and across the country immigrant parents will continue to wonder if taking their kids to the doctor or enrolling them in a school lunch program means their family will have to separate down the road.   This is an affront to our character as a nation.,2020-01-27 20:23:29,TweetDeck,51,240

President Trump didn't allow a single witness.   He didn’t turn over a single piece of evidence.  The Senate must demand a fair trial. The future of our democracy is at stake. https://t.co/QR8fez5yMm,2020-01-25 04:32:57,TweetDeck,251,1202

At this point in the Clinton trial there were 90000 documents and witnesses for the Senate and the American people to consider.   Today we have none of that – because of the president’s cover up. https://t.co/MFNflICfjf,2020-01-24 00:01:49,TweetDeck,475,1439
