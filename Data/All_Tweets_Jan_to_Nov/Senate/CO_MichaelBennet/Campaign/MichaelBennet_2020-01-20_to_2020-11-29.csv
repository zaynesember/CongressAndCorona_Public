I believe we're all called to be founders of this country. Just as those who fought the Revolution are founders so are Frederick Douglass &amp; Martin Luther King Jr. who—through sacrifice and patriotism—made our republic more democratic and more fair.

It would be easy to look at 20 years of wars &amp; broken politics and turn away. But the next generation is the one that’s going to save us—and it starts with voting.

The Real Deal isn't empty promises of free stuff which have dominated this primary.  The Real Deal is a progressive paid for and popular agenda to make lasting progress for you and your family.  That's how we beat Trump.  https://t.co/13ZGGfmV2U,2020-02-10 18:38:59,Twitter Web App,22,70
I couldn't agree with @JamesCarville more—politics is all about building coalitions and listening to people. That's what I've done my entire career as a public servant and what I'll do as president to make lasting progress for all Americans. https://t.co/Lz7XF7JL5X,2020-02-10 18:18:08,Twitter Media Studio,33,112
Our country can't afford another four years of @realDonaldTrump. We need to run on an agenda like the Real Deal that will not only galvanize the Democratic base but also help us win back some of the nine million people who voted for Obama then Trump. https://t.co/oAmyHS9jZJ,2020-02-10 17:55:49,Twitter Media Studio,30,78
.@JamesCarville: "We have to win NC Georgia Texas—and states like that across the country. The reason I’m for Michael Bennet—given his background &amp; story—is he’s able to connect with people. He would pick up 55 Senate seats. I want a big win here. Let’s see what happens in NH." https://t.co/Nds8zH69q1,2020-02-10 17:46:16,Twitter Media Studio,13,64
I’ve bet it all in on New Hampshire—a state that’s a lot like Colorado and not just for the mountains!  I’ve spent more time here than any other candidate and I think we’ll surprise some people tomorrow. #FITN #nhpolitics https://t.co/Zeogm35Wfb,2020-02-10 17:34:49,Twitter Media Studio,23,101
We have to win elections.  To do that we need to win purple states—like I've done twice in Colorado.   That's the only way we will beat Donald Trump flip the Senate and hold the House. https://t.co/vXmiX9Fu3H,2020-02-10 17:22:03,Twitter Media Studio,20,98
There are two primaries going on: One with families concerned about their housing &amp; healthcare. Another with people engaging in politics on social media &amp; cable TV.

Our democracy was broken before Trump got here but he’s certainly made matters worse.  We need a president who can unify us and overcome the dysfunction in Washington not exacerbate it. https://t.co/IRO2xlxE4R,2020-02-10 16:40:00,Twitter Media Studio,36,109

The Real Deal is an agenda Democrats up and down the ballot—in blue purple and red states—can run on. It would profoundly improve the lives of millions of Americans and it's achievable and fiscally responsible. https://t.co/8Ls8Cek9Ft,2020-02-10 15:50:29,Twitter Media Studio,14,72
New Hampshire voters would back me up on this: They are less decided today than they were 6 weeks or 6 months ago. They’re still looking for the candidate who can beat @realDonaldTrump.   I believe I’m that candidate &amp; we have a chance to surprise people tomorrow. @Morning_Joe,2020-02-10 13:07:54,Twitter for iPhone,17,101
What am I hearing from the people in New Hampshire? It’s simple:  1. Who can beat Trump?  2. How are you going to get anything done?   3. Our schools infrastructure health care and resources aren’t as good as they used to be and we need to start investing in America again. https://t.co/hbNLUnsDaU,2020-02-10 12:54:37,Twitter for iPhone,23,95

Thank you New Hampshire! You’ve bucked conventional wisdom before &amp; this is your chance to reset the race with a candidate who can beat Trump &amp; govern the country again.

“55% of the people in this country don’t want @realDonaldTrump to be president. It is up to the Democratic Party to provide that nominee that fills in that 55%. It is without a doubt Michael Bennet.” - @JamesCarville https://t.co/r8F0SJtGSE,2020-02-09 00:13:34,Twitter Media Studio,110,422
“There is no doubt in my mind that Senator Bennet would be the best President ... He would be by far the strongest general election candidate we have.” - @JamesCarville https://t.co/8eeuZiob8M,2020-02-08 23:58:02,Twitter Media Studio,106,444

Thank you to everyone who joined our town hall in Manchester this afternoon!  If any employee at this firm tweeted the way @realDonaldTrump did you’d be called in to HR.

@PortsNHRotary @Timberland Thank you to Robert &amp; Crystal for hosting us tonight in Brentwood.

@PortsNHRotary @Timberland We can’t win in November with empty promises and free stuff.  We need The Real Deal — an agenda that’s progressive paid for and popular.  That’s how we’ll make Donald Trump a one-term president and send Mitch McConnell packing.  #RealDealRoadTrip #FITN https://t.co/NxnrwGZu2F,2020-02-07 00:44:02,Twitter Web App,15,38
@PortsNHRotary Day #1 Stop #2 on the #RealDealRoadTrip: An employee town hall at @Timberland in Stratham.  "Nature Needs Heroes" and each one of us must be part of the fight.

@PortsNHRotary In the last 20 years we spent $10 trillion on tax cuts for the rich &amp; wars in the Middle East.   We could’ve fixed every road. We could have created free preschool. But we did nothing.  The Real Deal is about investing in our kids &amp; country once again.  #RealDealRoadTrip #FITN https://t.co/PapioXQTk0,2020-02-07 00:24:57,Twitter Web App,22,47
First stop on our #RealDealRoadTrip is the @PortsNHRotary!  We need to restore a government that reflects the Rotarians’ four-way test for what we say and do: truth fairness goodwill &amp; benefit for all.  That would be leadership our kids can be proud of.  #FITN https://t.co/wIOxZoW2IR,2020-02-06 23:36:25,Twitter Web App,10,45
Instead of thinking about the next generation members of Congress are thinking like politicians. That’s why they’ve racked up the national debt without investing in our schools roads &amp; bridges mental health resources &amp; more.   We can do better for our kids &amp; grandkids.,2020-02-06 23:19:04,Twitter for iPhone,9,30
And we're off!   I’m criss-crossing New Hampshire on our #RealDealRoadTrip in the final days ahead of the #FITN primary sharing my progressive paid-for and popular agenda with Granite Staters.

22% of kids live in poverty in this country &amp; if you don’t have food &amp; housing you can’t show up to school ready to learn.   My plan to massively increase the child tax credit would give families at least $3000 a year per kid cutting childhood poverty by 40% in just one year.,2020-02-06 23:00:17,Twitter for iPhone,10,24
We are treating America’s kids like they are someone else’s kids and it’s unacceptable.    We have to address preschool through higher education as a coherent arc—including the transitions where students too often fall through the cracks.   #collegeaffordability #nhpolitics,2020-02-06 22:47:17,Twitter for iPhone,11,18
There is nothing more at war with who we are as Americans than the fact that if you’re born poor in this country your chances of going to college are 9 in 100. #collegeaffordability #nhpolitics,2020-02-06 22:45:34,Twitter for iPhone,7,17
The issue we don’t talk about enough is that college costs too much.   We must solve the student loan crisis but we also have to solve the root of the problem. As president I would convene governors &amp; university presidents to find the right incentives to lower higher ed costs.,2020-02-06 22:42:40,Twitter for iPhone,3,17

While the Senate may have failed a test to save our democracy my prayer for the country is that the American people won't do the same.    I'm optimistic that we won't—we have never failed it before. And I don't think we'll fail it in our time. #ImpeachmentTrial https://t.co/aw49bjBIJT,2020-02-05 21:24:09,Twitter Web App,39,145
The idea that we would turn our back and close our eyes to evidence pounding on the outside of the doors of this Capitol is pitiful. It is disgraceful. And it will be a stain on this body for all time. #ImpeachmentTrial,2020-02-05 21:20:23,Twitter Web App,120,547
We're the only body on the planet charged with the responsibility of determining @realDonaldTrump's guilt or innocence. And we can't even bring ourselves to have witnesses &amp; evidence in a fair trial.   Today we failed in our duty to the American people. https://t.co/y1u6P8PrKx,2020-02-05 21:13:05,Twitter Web App,81,278

We are exactly one week from the #FITN primary. Our goal is to exceed expectations and surge on February 11th by:  - Continuing to build momentum across the state - Getting our message in front of more voters with TV ads - Capitalizing on the chaos coming out of Iowa,2020-02-04 22:07:04,Twitter Web App,9,41
The number of undecided voters at this time in the race is unprecedented and voters are not convinced the leading candidates have what it takes to beat Trump. In short the race is unsettled—even more so after the events of last night.,2020-02-04 22:01:13,Twitter Web App,5,31

You can’t escape history—none of us can. This is a reminder of how important America is to the rest of the world.

I was asked at a town hall tonight about my family's history.   My mom was a Polish Jew who survived the Holocaust &amp; rebuilt her shattered life in the United States.

Voters are less decided today than they were 6 months ago and they’re rightly asking: Who can beat Trump?   As a senator from a swing state with an agenda that can unify people I’m the right candidate to take on Trump and help Democrats win up &amp; down the ballot in November. https://t.co/xOe9EFJr6s,2020-02-03 17:04:10,Twitter Media Studio,25,106

@DaggettSusan I wrote the damn bill for a public option plan to give families choice &amp; lower costs.   I've led this effort for 10 years—unlike others who have flip-flopped or put Democrats on defense—because it's the fastest &amp; best way to cover everyone.   #JustTheTruth https://t.co/wySy52Ik9D,2020-02-03 15:17:00,Twitter Web App,7,21

For some context: This is FOUR TIMES the cost of the House investigation @realDonaldTrump keeps complaining about. https://t.co/6IILUhJCZi,2020-02-01 22:54:09,Twitter for iPhone,34,111
As a candidate @realDonaldTrump said "I'm going to be working for you. I'm not going to have time to go play golf."  As president he's golfed 114 times at a taxpayer cost of $125 million.  To recap: he lied he slacked off and then he charged us for it. https://t.co/wI3T3di4sP,2020-02-01 22:25:24,Twitter Web App,253,863

Tune in tonight to @FullFrontalSamB at 10:30 PM ET on @TBSNetwork.   I sat down with @iamsambee at a bar in NYC to talk about @realDonaldTrump’s reckless foreign policy (and buying things off eBay). https://t.co/hq3H9r7JYv,2020-01-22 23:55:44,Twitter Web App,26,108
Remember when I said if you elect me president you won't have to think about me for two weeks at a time so you can raise your kids and live your lives?

The ACA has always been unfinished business because some people remain uncovered.   Americans need better health care now. We have no time to waste.

@StopBigMoney We have an incredible opportunity to usher in a new era of progress. Like generations of Americans before us we must fix our politics and build confidence in our noble exercise in self-government. There is no one to do it but us.,2020-01-21 15:49:21,Twitter Web App,10,30
@StopBigMoney We won't stop there. We will end partisan gerrymandering ban Members of Congress from becoming lobbyists &amp; ensure every eligible voter has access to the ballot box.  As a #ReformFirst candidate I'll stand with @StopBigMoney to get money out of politics &amp; bring people back in.,2020-01-21 15:46:22,Twitter Web App,12,37
@StopBigMoney To make progress on the issues we care about we have to fix our broken politics.   As president I'll campaign in all 50 states to pass a Constitutional Amendment to overturn Citizens United.  This is how we'll start to mobilize the country around a set of progressive reforms.,2020-01-21 15:42:32,Twitter Web App,10,27
@StopBigMoney This Corruption of INACTION—the hearings not held the bills not passed—is the consequence of Citizens United. It's why for the past 10 years we've made no progress on our most pressing challenges. Climate change being the best example.,2020-01-21 15:39:51,Twitter Web App,10,28
@StopBigMoney And when it came to independent expenditures SCOTUS said "Those are independent. They won't cause Americans to lose faith in our democracy."   So they allowed billionaires to give unlimited amounts of dark $$ to outside groups immobilizing our government in the exact same way.,2020-01-21 15:37:12,Twitter Web App,8,25
@StopBigMoney Let's say a lawmaker wants to hold a hearing on climate change.   All the Kochs &amp; other billionaires have to do is rattle the coins in their pockets &amp; threaten to fund the primary opponent in that lawmaker's next election.  Just like that the climate hearing is dropped.,2020-01-21 15:32:58,Twitter Web App,9,28
@StopBigMoney Citizens United created what I call a Corruption of Inaction.   SCOTUS imagined a world of quid pro quo corruption where billionaires bribe lawmakers to pass bills on their behalf—a Corruption of Action. But they completely missed the point.,2020-01-21 15:28:08,Twitter Web App,8,23
@StopBigMoney I was up for my first Senate election in 2010 right after Citizens United. Because I was the most vulnerable Democrat more outside money was spent in my race than any other that cycle.   So I've seen the damage up close and I understand the nature of the corruption.,2020-01-21 15:24:56,Twitter Web App,6,21
Today marks 10 years since the Citizens United decision which gave billionaires unmatched influence over Washington &amp; separated Americans from their government.

My anti-poverty plan—the most progressive since Medicaid—will: ✅Cut child poverty in 1/2 by end of 1st year ✅Cut adult poverty in 1/2 by end of 1st term ✅Eliminate homelessness by end of 2nd term ✅Put us on path to eliminate poverty in a generation  #brownandblack @bandbforum https://t.co/ojTzltzCAX,2020-01-21 15:10:40,Twitter Media Studio,14,55
You can draw a straight line from slavery to Jim Crow to the redlining of our banking and housing systems to mass incarceration to disparities in health and educational outcomes today.

As part of The Real Deal Agenda my American Family Act would be a major tax cut for the middle class &amp; cut child poverty by 40% in just one year.  That would transform the lives of millions of people in this country &amp; we can do it without adding a single government bureaucrat. https://t.co/o5zj0SoB2D,2020-01-21 01:29:10,Twitter Media Studio,28,109
We can't just mobilize the Democratic base. We also have to win back some of the nine million people who voted twice for Barack Obama and once for Donald Trump. The Real Deal is the agenda to do that. https://t.co/QlNUENS6hj,2020-01-21 00:32:46,Twitter Web App,26,81

I wrote the damn bill for a public option healthcare plan to give families a choice &amp; lower costs.   I've led this effort for 10 years — unlike others who have flip-flopped or put Democrats on defense — because I know it's the fastest &amp; best way to cover everyone.   #JustTheTruth https://t.co/wySy52Ik9D,2020-01-20 22:24:14,Twitter Media Studio,61,267

Dr. King is just as much a Founder as those who wrote our Constitution. Because all who demand a more perfect union and do the hard work of making it so are Founders.   Today we all must be Founders once again to make real the promises of our Constitution.,2020-01-20 14:02:39,Twitter Web App,20,71
Dr. King of anyone had reason to feel cynical. Instead he chose hope.   In these challenging times we too could be cynical but instead we must heed his calls to hold deep our faith in the future and our own ability to shape it.,2020-01-20 14:01:57,Twitter Web App,49,209
