The work Chairman Powell and Secretary Mnuchin did standing these facilities up – under extraordinary circumstances – was enormously successful in stabilizing and normalizing credit markets.

I appreciate Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell agreeing to return unused CARES Act funds as part of the statutorily prescribed wind down of the emergency lending facilities. https://t.co/15JgoXsyCH,2020-11-20 23:19:46,Twitter Web App,9,98

These temporary facilities helped to both normalize markets and produce record levels of liquidity. Congress’s intent was clear: these facilities were to be temporary to provide liquidity and to cease operations by the end of 2020.,2020-11-19 22:23:46,Twitter for iPhone,2,24

The Chinese gov. hacked &amp; stole the private data of millions of Americans including over 5.5 million Pennsylvanians. This reckless unacceptable &amp; brazen disregard for the rule of law must not stand.

The economy is the best its been in my life and I'm not that young. January's jobs report showed:   ✅225K jobs added (expectation was 162K)  ✅Wage growth of 3.1%  ✅Workers' wages outpacing managers' wages   Proof that GOP and @RealDonaldTrump's pro-growth policies are working.,2020-02-07 16:03:29,Twitter Web App,266,1032
