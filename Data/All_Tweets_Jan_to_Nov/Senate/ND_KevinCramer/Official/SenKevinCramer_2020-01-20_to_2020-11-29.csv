As President @realDonaldTrump has prioritized a resilient grid.  He’s proposed policies to: ✅better maintain transmission lines ✅make nuclear plant operations more efficient and ✅accurately value the benefit of reliable baseload generation. https://t.co/yoGHkZuf3W,2020-09-10 20:38:03,Twitter for iPhone,264,777
.@SenateDems’ argument seems to be that if we won’t give Democrats everything they want the American people should get nothing at all.  That’s nonsense.

Californians spent August in the dark—literally and figuratively.  At fault at least in part is the state’s over-reliance on unreliable sources of energy like wind and solar.

As I told @DanaBashCNN this morning Democrats have failed to make the case for impeaching @realDonaldTrump and no witness would change that.  Now it’s time to vote and finally put this behind us. https://t.co/VFMdhzjUm0,2020-01-31 17:41:59,Twitter Media Studio,26,113
.@SenToddYoung &amp; I asked @realDonaldTrump’s team about @RepAdamSchiff claiming if @POTUS were innocent he'd accept all the witnesses &amp; documents they want.  Obviously the answer is no.  Their assertion creates a dangerous precedent &amp; runs contrary to our criminal justice system. https://t.co/HgW7WYpqA2,2020-01-31 00:00:38,Twitter Media Studio,177,652

The legislation I offered would:  ✅authorize the VA Secretary to enter into public-private partnerships to research the effectiveness of HBOT.  ✅require the VA to use an objective test to measure HBOT treatment. ✅commission a comprehensive review and study of HBOT.,2020-01-30 18:05:11,Twitter for iPhone,3,2
Our bill is a positive step.  It advances the study of HBOT treatment which ought to create a pathway for more veterans to receive access to this care.,2020-01-30 18:05:11,Twitter for iPhone,1,0
Our legislation contains several provisions to improve mental health services for veterans including an expansion of the VA’s research into Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy.

Life begins at conception.  Our laws should reflect that truth especially when it comes to helping mothers provide for the welfare of their children.

Democrats finished their opening statements having done nothing to win Republicans over but they’ve done plenty to push them away.

It’s abundantly clear @RepAdamSchiff &amp; @RepJerryNadler weren’t trying to win Senate Republicans over.  Their opening statements were New York &amp; California trying to shame middle America into wanting @POTUS @realDonaldTrump removed from office.  It didn’t work. #ImpeachmentTrial https://t.co/PVYO0hfb7F,2020-01-25 19:54:39,Twitter for iPhone,32,110
