Maybe even NM. He literally said he will get to “complete zero emissions by 2025.”  All while supporting fracking. https://t.co/ahqB009Mav,2020-10-23 02:58:15,Twitter for iPhone,12,36
At the same time he said he supports fracking. https://t.co/Bq6SKduM1j,2020-10-23 02:37:55,Twitter for iPhone,8,45
I wasn’t sure I heard him right. He seems very confused on energy policy. https://t.co/Hxg1Y9Tmnh,2020-10-23 02:37:06,Twitter for iPhone,6,21
Did @JoeBiden just say he’d get to zero emissions by 2025. And how does he plan to allow fracking while eliminating oil? Go @realDonaldTrump #Debates2020,2020-10-23 02:35:37,Twitter for iPhone,15,59
This #Debates2020 can’t end fast enough for Beijing @JoeBiden   Go @realDonaldTrump !,2020-10-23 02:24:30,Twitter for iPhone,4,23
.@JoeBiden just referred to @realDonaldTrump as Abraham Lincoln. LOL! #Debates2020,2020-10-23 02:22:16,Twitter for iPhone,5,30
Did @JoeBiden just admit he will present a path to citizenship for 11 million illegal immigrants? @realDonaldTrump should run that clip every day until the election. #Debates2020,2020-10-23 02:08:32,Twitter for iPhone,18,47
.@JoeBiden said healthcare is a right.  Does he believe people have a right to not have it? #Debates2020,2020-10-23 01:55:41,Twitter for iPhone,4,15
Again @JoeBiden didn’t offer a single thing he would do to China for sending COVID to us and the moderator let him by with it. She asked for “specific plans.”  Go @realDonaldTrump #Debates2020,2020-10-23 01:44:01,Twitter for iPhone,13,51
Who knew @JoeBiden would raise the issue of the evidence his family is in bed with China and Russia and Ukraine? Go @realDonaldTrump #Debates2020,2020-10-23 01:31:45,Twitter for iPhone,3,33
A quick review of @JoeBiden comments &amp; tweets right after @realDonaldTrump shut down travel from China make it clear he is lying. He called @POTUS xenophobic for the shutdown multiple times. #Debates2020,2020-10-23 01:26:32,Twitter for iPhone,12,31
Isn’t the moderator going to insist @JoeBiden answer the question about having a specific plan to combat COVID? #Debates2020,2020-10-23 01:16:34,Twitter for iPhone,6,25
Go @LewisForMN ! https://t.co/QODgnDyySD,2020-10-22 19:46:30,Twitter for iPhone,23,119

Please fire @FoxNewsSunday ‘s Chris Wallace @FoxNews . His bias is ridiculous. He’s incapable of objective analysis. And of course he brings up the fly on @Mike_Pence’s hair. He’s lost any and all credibility as a newsman. #DumpWallace,2020-10-08 02:42:44,Twitter for iPad,14,56
Even Chris Wallace @FoxNewsSunday can’t possibly suggest anything other than @Mike_Pence won this debate on every issue and form. I’m sorry it has to end. Great Victory for @realDonaldTrump ! #VPDebate #Debates2020,2020-10-08 02:32:59,Twitter for iPad,16,46
Is @KamalaHarris really bragging about being a prosecutor in a debate about law and order while defending looters and vandals? She really is out of touch. She’s losing it big time. Go @Mike_Pence  #VPDebate #Debates2020,2020-10-08 02:21:03,Twitter for iPad,17,37
Just last week the Senate voted on an amendment to protect people with pre-existing conditions. Every @SenateGOP voted to protect.Not a single @SenateDems voted to protect including @KamalaHarris.  Go @realDonaldTrump &amp; @Mike_Pence ! #VPDebate #Debates,2020-10-08 02:11:21,Twitter for iPad,8,15
I almost feel sorry for @KamalaHarris . On one hand she says @realDonaldTrump hasn’t shut down enough things to end COVID and blames him for the economic slump. She thinks the American people are idiots. @Mike_Pence respects the American people. #VPDebate #Debates2020,2020-10-08 01:48:45,Twitter for iPad,9,44
Poor @KamalaHarris has been caught lying on every single question. #VPDebate #Debates2020   Joe Biden has made it clear he will abolish the Trump Tax Cuts and he will abolish Fracking.,2020-10-08 01:42:04,Twitter for iPad,15,42
.@KamalaHarris ‘ very familiar laughing problem is now fully engaged. Expect her desperation to get worse as the night goes on. @Mike_Pence is absolutely destroying her. #VPDebate #Debates2020 Go @realDonaldTrump !,2020-10-08 01:38:06,Twitter for iPad,15,37
Obviously @realDonaldTrump has a lot of debt he’s a very successful real estate developer. He understands leverage and its impact in a successful economy. Equally as obviously @KamalaHarris has no clue about the topic. Or maybe she’s engaging in class warfare.... #VPDebate,2020-10-08 01:35:23,Twitter for iPad,10,40
She begins with a whopper of a lie by repeating the @AP fact checked and discredited line that @realDonaldTrump called COVID a “hoax.” I suspect its the beginning of a trend. #VPDebate #Debates2020,2020-10-08 01:14:22,Twitter for iPad,11,30
Chris Wallace @FoxNewsSunday just called  @Mike_Pence a good “political performer.” I guess being a smart dignified conservative could only be a “performer” and not an articulate sincere public servant. Why does @FoxNews give him any airtime? #VPDebate #Debates2020,2020-10-08 01:06:36,Twitter for iPad,6,15
Chris Wallace @FoxNewsSunday just said @Mike_Pence has to have a “clean victory” in the #VPDebate  in order to “change the narrative”. Chris and his liberal pals in the media have already determined the narrative and are practicing it every day. Go VP Pence! #Debates2020,2020-10-08 00:58:25,Twitter for iPad,9,29
It sounds like @JoeBiden wants to turn US energy policy over to other nations when he’s not turning it over to the Squad. @realDonaldTrump has #MadeAmericaGreat with good American made energy policy and jobs.,2020-09-30 02:30:37,Twitter for iPhone,14,23
