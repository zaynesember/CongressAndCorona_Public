All week we heard divisiveness and extreme partisanship at the RNC convention.   It's never been more clear: we must elect @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris to restore the soul of our nation and build our communities back better from this challenging time.,2020-08-28 03:40:09,Twitter for iPhone,22,117
Together with Nevada’s women leaders I’m calling out President Trump for his efforts to strike down the ACA mishandling #COVID19 and handing out corporate tax breaks.   He's failed America's women and we deserve better leadership.   That leader is @JoeBiden. https://t.co/xaiAa97CYz,2020-08-27 23:25:21,Twitter for iPhone,28,103
