The Title IX rule is a devastating blow but as we continue to help students families K-12 schools and colleges recover from the impact of coronavirus I won’t stop trying to do everything I can to ensure that every single student can learn in a safe environment.,2020-05-06 18:21:21,Twitter Web App,15,57
I've fought against the Title IX rule every step of the way alongside brave students &amp; survivors who shared their stories. While I’m deeply disappointed I’m not surprised @BetsyDeVosED ignored these voices &amp; moved forward with a rule that strips away protections for survivors.,2020-05-06 18:21:21,Twitter Web App,51,119
.@BetsyDeVosED's Title IX rule is not about "restoring balance" it's about silencing survivors. It will make it harder for students to report an incident of sexual assault or harassment—and that much easier for a school to sweep it under the rug.,2020-05-06 18:21:20,Twitter Web App,29,60
Right now @usedgov should be using every resource available to implement its CARES Act funding with the urgency consistency and equity it requires—not issuing regulations that are not only completely unrelated to combating coronavirus but will actually harm students.,2020-05-06 18:21:20,Twitter Web App,32,122
2 months since President Trump said "anybody who wants a test can get a test”—&amp; it’s still not true.

Today Republicans’ hypocrisy is on full display. @senatemajldr has claimed he wants to get things done but instead of voting on any of Dems' bills to help families Republicans wanted to vote on two anti-doctor anti-women anti-family bills that are absolute nonstarters. https://t.co/q9TUXNQ9LJ,2020-02-25 20:35:00,Twitter Media Studio,225,502

Today @RepJeffries challenged each of us in the Senate to uphold the best in our country's character as this trial progresses—and not allow one President's actions to stain it. Once again that means fairness honesty and transparency not a cover up.,2020-01-24 21:17:00,Twitter Web App,92,428
The first two days of the House managers' presentation of the facts have been compelling and powerful. The third and final day of their argument begins at 10am PST/1pm ET—watch here: https://t.co/CcvnE66dQm,2020-01-24 17:35:00,TweetDeck,27,95
Another brazen lie from President Trump. He has ALREADY proposed changes that could strip Social Security away from people with disabilities.   And tens of thousands of people have ALREADY written in opposing that harmful scheme.  https://t.co/XwEh7mR3nI https://t.co/PEmWJu55Qd,2020-01-24 16:59:14,Twitter Web App,82,202
Today we can expect more misinformation &amp; falsehoods from President Trump on abortion—but the truth is the Trump-Pence Administration's backward agenda is making it more difficult &amp; dangerous for women to access the care they need &amp; make deeply personal decisions for themselves.,2020-01-24 16:05:00,TweetDeck,99,414
Despite what @SecAzar says the Trump Administration has already been clear about what their health care plan entails—making coverage more expensive harder to get and lower-quality.   We must keep fighting to #ProtectOurCare.  https://t.co/SzDuosz2rq,2020-01-24 15:15:00,TweetDeck,60,136
This is a blatant attack on women's access to health care targeted at women who can least afford it. And it's a new low even for the Trump-Pence Administration. https://t.co/tVqVJ8O4ns,2020-01-24 14:15:27,Twitter Web App,74,185
If you listen to one part of today’s arguments make sure you listen to @RepAdamSchiff’s closing. It was so compelling—and made clear how much is at stake if Senate Republicans allow a cover-up rather than the fair honest trial Americans deserve.,2020-01-24 04:06:05,Twitter for iPhone,355,1432
I read the classified page of evidence submitted today. I’ve been thinking about it since and I can’t come up with a reason why the White House won’t declassify this information except for unnecessarily trying to keep information from the public. https://t.co/Mo8RxtuNDh,2020-01-23 23:37:52,Twitter Web App,239,605
As House managers continue their oral presentations at 10am PST I hope my Republican colleagues are paying close attention as the facts of President Trump’s actions are held up to the law &amp; the Constitution. Watch here: https://t.co/CcvnE5OCYO,2020-01-23 17:51:00,TweetDeck,71,265
If you’re a billionaire the GOP will fight to give you a huge tax cut.  BUT if you’re a senior or have a disability they will fight to cut programs you rely on like Medicare &amp; Social Security.  That’s absolutely backwards &amp; I'll stand against any attempt to cut these programs. https://t.co/G3HwbGe7ml,2020-01-23 17:37:36,Twitter Web App,577,1564
I had a lengthy conversation w/@CDCDirector this morning about the steps being taken to respond to the novel coronavirus. I'll continue monitoring this situation closely &amp; making sure we do everything we can to keep families safe &amp; healthy.

It's simple. Allowing new witnesses and key documents that President Trump has hidden from the public so far to be part of the trial would provide new information—but Senate Republicans voted against additional information 12 times. https://t.co/5YKyu2IwjO,2020-01-23 17:06:04,Twitter Web App,208,599
Congress clearly needs to put a much-needed check on this President to stop him from stealing funding from our military &amp; their families for his vanity project.  I introduced legislation to do that by returning the stolen funds &amp; making sure no President can do this again. https://t.co/RrGh71zaT6,2020-01-23 14:08:51,Twitter Web App,101,369
The House managers’ presentation of the facts today makes it even harder for Senate Republicans to explain why they don’t want to hear from key witnesses or see key documents President Trump has withheld. Americans deserve a fair &amp; honest trial that puts our country first.,2020-01-23 02:57:35,Twitter Web App,376,1688
Oral arguments in the Senate impeachment trial begin today at 10am PST/1pm ET. The House managers will have a total of 24 hours over the next 3 days to make their case. Watch the proceedings here: https://t.co/CcvnE66dQm,2020-01-22 17:34:29,Twitter Web App,38,99
The facts are clear. We can’t afford to NOT expand access to high-quality affordable child care and paid family leave policies. That’s why I’ve introduced legislation to do both. https://t.co/F5v5RWwPGl,2020-01-22 17:03:06,Twitter Web App,25,106
Speaking now about the Senate impeachment trial. Senate Democrats will keep doing everything we can to push for a fair honest trial like Americans deserve—not a cover up.  https://t.co/X4EQHeGEDO,2020-01-22 16:09:58,Twitter Media Studio,123,470
47 years ago #RoeVWade affirmed the constitutional right to safe legal abortion &amp; protected a woman’s right to plan her life and family as she chooses. Now more than ever our reproductive rights are under attack. We must stand together and fight back to protect Roe. https://t.co/rP3JweMPwm,2020-01-22 15:25:28,Twitter Media Studio,137,528
The contrast between Senate GOP &amp; Dems could not be more stark.   We asked for key witnesses they said no; key documents they said no.  All info POTUS &amp; team hid from the public so far.  Americans deserve fairness &amp; honesty in this process—not a cover up.,2020-01-22 06:59:19,Twitter Web App,425,1558
Before I head back into the President’s impeachment trial let me just say you can’t ‘dispel the notion’ of a Constitutional right. https://t.co/iyN4e4JEHO,2020-01-22 01:21:17,Twitter Web App,100,390
President Trump &amp; Republicans might be happy to run out the clock until the next election with their partisan lawsuit—but they’ve already made their endgame perfectly clear: they want to take health care &amp; protections away from hundreds of millions of families who rely on them. https://t.co/37NUGNUI1k,2020-01-21 17:24:34,Twitter Web App,116,262
We all need to remember the oath we took and act in ways that prove the Senate and all our democratic institutions are worthy of the public's trust now and for generations to come. That's how high the stakes are. Let's get this right.,2020-01-21 16:19:12,Twitter Web App,74,206
We need to vote today for evidence &amp; fairness not a sham designed to protect an impeached President from the facts.,2020-01-21 16:19:11,Twitter Web App,51,190
At the end of this trial no one should doubt that the Senate has acted fairly &amp; honorably—but we will be unable to do that with a dead-of-night rushed cover-up resolution like the one Mitch McConnell has put forward.,2020-01-21 16:18:11,Twitter Web App,33,73
I hope Republican senators recognize we cannot do our job as senators to "do impartial justice" without key documents and witness testimony that has so far been hidden from the public.,2020-01-21 16:17:40,Twitter Web App,30,88
People across the country are watching this carefully. They want to know all the relevant testimony and evidence is being considered—and that the Senate is acting fairly rather than staging a cover-up.,2020-01-21 16:17:06,Twitter Web App,22,75
Leader McConnell has explicitly said "no" to impartial justice in spite of the careful &amp; thorough investigation the House conducted &amp; in spite of President Trump's unprecedented stonewalling &amp; continued refusal to provide any credible defense against the allegations against him.,2020-01-21 16:16:20,Twitter Web App,30,74

Tomorrow at 10am PST/1pm ET the impeachment trial begins in the Senate. I will approach my responsibility as a juror with the seriousness and impartiality required to fulfill my oaths to protect our Constitution—and I hope all of my colleagues do the same. https://t.co/jFMxBNExFB,2020-01-21 02:30:20,Twitter Media Studio,212,1031
Republicans are putting health care in our country on a completely avoidable catastrophic crash course w/ their partisan lawsuit.  I urge President Trump &amp; Republicans to listen to patients &amp; drop their partisan &amp; deeply harmful attacks on families’ health care. #ProtectOurCare,2020-01-20 18:45:00,TweetDeck,65,232

We are still striving for the future Martin Luther King Jr. was fighting for—but if we stand together to fight injustice we can all make a difference. This #MLKDay let's recommit to his vision of justice service &amp; fairness.,2020-01-20 15:41:24,Twitter for iPhone,30,112
As a former preschool teacher I know how important high-quality child care is for a child's future—but the skyrocketing costs are putting it out of reach for so many families.    We must make #ChildCare4All a reality. https://t.co/DKEEjiFRFX,2020-01-20 00:45:00,TweetDeck,42,189
