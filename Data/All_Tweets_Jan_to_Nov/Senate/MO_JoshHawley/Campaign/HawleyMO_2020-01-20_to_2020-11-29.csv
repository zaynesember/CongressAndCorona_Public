Not allowed to leave the parlors  forced to eat all their meals &amp; sleep in a small room they shared with other victims.

Utterly false. The female victims none of whom spoke English were freed not charged. The participants in the ring were charged. I’ll never forget seeing the conditions in which the victims were kept - https://t.co/3fvPipi6bP,2020-06-06 12:18:38,Twitter for iPhone,276,707
And yes I went after Backpage as a prosector and when they tried to stop me beat them in federal court. And yes I took on an Asian trafficking ring and we freed a dozen women in sex slavery. And stopped the trafficking. If you think I should apologize for that you’re insane,2020-06-06 12:05:12,Twitter for iPhone,110,613
This is a remarkable thread in which prominent #BigTech defender and supposed “libertarian” PRAISES human traffickers and the founders of the trafficking site Backpage. That says it all https://t.co/HGOXy7TQzt,2020-06-06 12:05:12,Twitter for iPhone,164,530
For those interested in the #Section230 debate here’s a detailed look at the history which corrects a series of misrepresentations made by the #BigTech-paid apologists.

to evade state criminal &amp; civil charges as well as federal civil charges. When fed prosecutors finally got Backpage it was for money laundering. And groups like @TechFreedom were against changing 230 to stop sex trafficking on sites like Backpage,2020-06-05 19:20:54,Twitter for iPad,54,138
One other thing worth pointing out. @TechFreedom - funded by Big Tech - shamelessly claims that the judically rewritten Section 230 didn’t protect sex trafficking site https://t.co/6Be0m1l37L from accountability. In reality Backpage used Section 230 as a shield for many years—,2020-06-05 19:20:54,Twitter for iPad,55,144
The #BigTech paid shills are at it again offering up a tortured history of Section 230 that - surprise! - exonerates @Twitter @Google @Facebook. Except it’s wrong. Here’s the real story of Section 230 laid out in detail https://t.co/OduU0qYGQc https://t.co/hQNgsa5RBo,2020-06-05 19:20:53,Twitter for iPad,150,347

Very encouraging news on jobs today with many furloughed workers getting rehired. Congress should act now to encourage further rehiring (and new hiring!) and spur the economy into full-fledged recovery #RehireAmerica https://t.co/FD94AFDkY1,2020-06-05 13:57:49,Twitter for iPad,149,499
Good Friday morning! Here’s an encouraging verse from Psalm 111:2-3. “Great are the works of the Lord studied by all who delight in them. Full of honor and majesty is his work and his righteousness endures forever.”,2020-06-05 11:30:16,Twitter for iPhone,198,846
So when do we get to have a conversation about the economic policies of the last 30+ years that shipped jobs in the urban core AND in rural America overseas and left working class folks in all places with fewer and fewer life prospects?,2020-06-05 00:37:00,Twitter for iPhone,1595,4529
So @charlescwcooke my question for you is which 230 do you want? The one Congress wrote in 1996 or the one we have now rewritten over and again by courts (with big assist from Big Tech lawyers)? https://t.co/WwDy0hdX3P,2020-06-04 20:40:01,Twitter for iPad,112,266
On anniversary of #TiananmenMassacre big banks announce they are FOR #China anti-democracy crackdown in #HongKong. One thing you can always count on from woke capital: putting the profit interests of capital first! https://t.co/L2bOvnsHzg,2020-06-04 20:01:00,Twitter for iPad,551,964
This is to put it mildly not what Congress wrote. Which is yet another reason why reform is needed,2020-06-04 19:42:40,Twitter for iPad,55,201
But courts rewrote the statute over the years eliminating the obscenity requirements eliminating distributor liability (for content known to be illegal) &amp; expanding immunity. So now tech platforms can alter modify or moderate content all WITHOUT being treated as publishers,2020-06-04 19:42:40,Twitter for iPad,50,168
Another myth: 230 was meant to reduce liability for tech companies. Not really. The Communications Decency Act IMPOSED liability on tech platforms for obscene content directed at children. 230 was added to give platforms immunity from suit to take down content (in good faith),2020-06-04 19:42:39,Twitter for iPad,30,74
In other words under the guise of “content moderation” tech platforms are now acting like traditional publishers but without the liability,2020-06-04 19:42:39,Twitter for iPad,37,100
Uh no. This mistake comes from lack of familiarity with the case law. Courts have interpreted 230 to allow platforms to alter &amp; modify 3d party content *without being treated* like a publisher. Backpage for example was helping design 3d party content &amp; still claiming immunity,2020-06-04 19:42:38,Twitter for iPad,34,101
Okay let’s get some facts straight. This article perpetuates a distorted history of Section 230 that I notice is becoming common in some quarters. Myth: Under Section 230 tech platforms &amp; other publishers are treated the same; no special treatment https://t.co/2qKYpPrRZi,2020-06-04 19:42:37,Twitter for iPad,211,416

I will introduce legislation to end these special government giveaways.

Global economic integration now amped up and pursued for its own sake. Nat security domestic needs &amp; liberalizing agenda diverge. Consequences for USA not so good. This system facilitated the “China shock” which has had major security implications as well as economic ones,2020-05-21 01:18:08,Twitter for iPhone,30,141
Uruguay Round marks significant departure. Industries &amp; sectors formerly outside GATT rules now brought in. And the largely advisory dispute resolution process of GATT replaced w/ binding WTO process complete w/ appellate body able to rely on its own decisions as precedent,2020-05-21 01:18:08,Twitter for iPhone,6,20
This is why GATT left such large areas of economy &amp; industry untouched and allowed nations such wide latitude in domestic regulation. It was never trade liberalizing or integration just for the sake of integration,2020-05-21 01:18:08,Twitter for iPhone,5,22
And my claim has been that in important respects Bretton Woods GATT placed the first in service to the second. Trade was meant to serve the end goals of national economic strength &amp; domestic stability among member states,2020-05-21 01:18:07,Twitter for iPhone,7,26

Rodrik 2011: “The creation of the WTO in 1995 ... ushered in quite a different understanding. Along with the onset of financial globalization around 1990 the WTO marks the pursuit of a new kind of globalization that reversed the Bretton Woods priorities”,2020-05-20 18:43:32,Twitter for iPad,26,88
It is vital to grasp that the post-WW2 and post-Cold War economic systems are different.
