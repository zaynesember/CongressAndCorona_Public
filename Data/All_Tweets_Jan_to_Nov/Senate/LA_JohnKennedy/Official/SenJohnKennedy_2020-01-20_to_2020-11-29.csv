Reports of Bolton’s book don't answer the question: Why did POTUS ask for an investigation?  The Ukrainian government has been organically &amp; historically corrupt &amp; Hunter Biden’s windfall from Burisma told the world America’s foreign policy can bought like a sack of potatoes. https://t.co/sIHbIFvtsK,2020-01-30 15:38:43,Twitter Media Studio,4525,15462

Iran's Ahmad Hamzeh is taking up Soleimani’s mantle.   America should answer his threats against our president and citizens by adding him to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons list.   We aren’t buying the poison Hamzeh’s selling. https://t.co/b1CnXSwDAk,2020-01-28 23:01:50,Twitter Web App,99,229
Money generated by the public auction of C-Band spectrum should go to American priorities not bailing out foreign companies.

Last year I called on @USTreasury to help Americans redeem $26B in unclaimed savings bonds including about $337M owed to Louisianians.

Expectant mothers and unborn children need access to quality medical care but the abortion industry cuts corners at their expense.   I introduced the Pregnant Women Health &amp; Safety Act to ensure women have access to protective care.  #ProLifeIsProWoman https://t.co/tnTnpo6zSj,2020-01-24 14:04:01,Twitter Web App,58,224
Yesterday House Democrats showed more zeal than wisdom in their accusations of a cover-up.   The reality is both sides will be treated fairly in the Senate—equal time and opportunity for the prosecution and defense. https://t.co/VK1RFHj74C,2020-01-22 15:26:57,Twitter Media Studio,282,1141
