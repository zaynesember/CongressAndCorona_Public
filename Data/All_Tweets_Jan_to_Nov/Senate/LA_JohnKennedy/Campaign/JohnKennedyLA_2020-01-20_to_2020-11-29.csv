The mainstream media doesn’t decide elections. Citizens casting legal ballots do and that’s what makes America great.   Courts must investigate all voting irregularities to ensure the integrity of our elections and the health of our democracy.,2020-11-08 20:37:06,Twitter Web App,12,56
It doesn't undermine democracy to insist elections be conducted fairly. POTUS' allegations about election irregularities should be heard promptly in a court of law. I continue to support Pres. Trump's reelection and the American principle that every legal vote should be counted.,2020-11-06 15:50:25,Twitter Web App,157,350
