Expelling a 16-year-old girl who has suffered extreme abuse without providing her rights for asylum proceedings is something we could never have expected from any U.S. gov’t.

Today’s bill provides a critical stopgap for our small businesses and hospitals but we cannot delay in providing further relief to American families.

We all know the playbook by now. Whenever Trump wants to change the subject he says something racist/draconian about immigration. He has failed the response to coronavirus &amp; has no plan for testing/tracing. Americans know it his poll numbers are falling—so voila same old song. https://t.co/epPCAmuFJp,2020-04-21 15:25:18,Twitter for iPhone,404,1186
Going back to business as usual without a strategy to contain the virus is DANGEROUS. Everyone wants to reopen but the only way to do it safely is with a BIG comprehensive strategy for testing &amp; contact tracing. @realDonaldTrump where is the plan?? https://t.co/sXszQRXpeS,2020-04-21 14:15:35,Twitter for iPhone,136,460
Donald Trump just funneled HALF A BILLION DOLLARS OF TAXPAYER MONEY to political allies during an election year to pursue his No. 1 campaign pet project but still doesn’t have a plan for nationwide coronavirus testing so we can end this crisis. https://t.co/xw0INdLrBj,2020-04-20 14:25:01,Twitter Web App,756,1119
This is a huge problem for getting through the pandemic: The Admin doesn’t have their act together for testing and contact tracing which is essential in tackling the public health challenge and reopening the economy.

None of this matters if there isn't a real plan for ramping up testing and for extensive contact tracing. Where are those plans??

After thousands of Americans have died and millions more lost their jobs Trump risks delaying direct payments to families just so he can put his name on them.

Trump dismisses global health emergency as “hoax” while WH &amp; Pence muzzle public health experts to control/distort communications. We’ve seen in China &amp; Iran the danger of regimes limiting fact-based health info to protect leaders.

In light of newly confirmed case of coronavirus in OR one of the most important things elected officials can do is make reliable info accessible.

As governor Mike Pence put ideology over science &amp; contributed to one of the worst HIV crises his state had ever seen.

@SenateDems @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @SenJohnKennedy 5. Finally we need to keep fighting this admin’s efforts to push junk insurance plans.

@SenateDems @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @SenJohnKennedy 3.

@SenateDems @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump 2. @realdonaldtrump needs to appoint an independent EXPERT global health “czar” to coordinate our response.

Every child—regardless of where they live or how much money their parents make—deserves a shot.

There’s more. Instead of fixing the student loan crisis this budget would make students pay interest while they’re still in school cut federal loan programs and make some borrowers pay more over longer periods of time. That's the opposite of productive. (4/5),2020-02-11 00:14:40,Twitter for iPhone,53,178
The President’s budget would also rip $865 million away from low-income students pursuing two- and four-year college degrees. (3/5),2020-02-11 00:14:39,Twitter for iPhone,33,104
For starters those cuts will eliminate 29 federal elementary and secondary education programs including grants that nearly 18000 rural school districts rely on. That’s unacceptable. (2/5),2020-02-11 00:14:39,Twitter for iPhone,29,115

“Yes he did it but we're looking the other way” is the basic sentiment of @SenateGOP. Using the power of the state to investigate an opponent? No action.

@Donna12May We’re not sure when exactly proceedings will adjourn so we’re keeping the coffee hot (although unfortunately for the Senators only water and milk is allowed on the floor!) – Emily ☕️,2020-01-21 23:51:35,Twitter for iPhone,8,38
@karen_brioso Believe me the Senator does too. –@MikeZamore,2020-01-21 23:42:33,Twitter for iPhone,2,13
@snarkysnowqueen ABSOLUTELY! Public pressure is so important. Your Senators work for you so continue calling emailing writing your local papers attending rallies and protests engaging your friends and family and make sure your public servants know what you expect from them — Emily,2020-01-21 23:40:36,Twitter for iPhone,27,91
@freewomen4ever @AmbJohnBolton Senator Merkley believes both sides should be able to make their case through a full and fair trial — and that has to include witnesses and documents. More from our Chief of Staff @MikeZamore: https://t.co/EnYz9oumi4,2020-01-21 23:13:47,Twitter for iPhone,22,62
@TheRust503 Only in the court of public opinion. — @MikeZamore Chief of Staff,2020-01-21 22:15:37,Twitter Web App,5,18
If a President can get away with blocking the witnesses and documents for an impeachment trial he’s a King not a President—exactly what our founders feared.,2020-01-21 22:14:11,Twitter Web App,1351,4112
@DebbieRhoden57 Debbie thank you for contacting your Senators. Continue contacting them so they know your expectations. Make noise. Get your friends/coworkers/family to do the same. Write letters to the editor w/ local papers. Protest. Basically don't let your voice be ignored.—Emily comms,2020-01-21 22:11:46,Twitter Web App,8,46

@yuzu It’s up to him to some degree but everyone’s expectation is that he will defer on all substantive questions to the Senate.  — @MikeZamore Chief of Staff,2020-01-21 22:01:50,Twitter Web App,4,18
We may not be able to respond to everyone but we’ll be monitoring everything and sharing your questions and feedback with the Senator throughout these proceedings.,2020-01-21 21:28:05,Twitter Web App,21,136
🚩UPDATE from Sen. Merkley’s team: Given the historic nature of today’s proceedings we know that a lot of people have questions. Jeff believes transparency is critical. Reply to this tweet w/ a relevant question and we’ll try to answer what we can. https://t.co/XtbYAumBc8,2020-01-21 21:28:05,Twitter Web App,150,403

I know there's a lot happening w/ all eyes on the Senate but 10 years ago today the Supreme Court fundamentally changed our government for the worse. We have to get dark money out of politics before it's too late. We have to end Citizens United. @StopBigMoney @SenWhitehouse https://t.co/i7AZUjpafU,2020-01-21 16:57:09,Twitter for iPhone,347,942
Does anyone know of any trial anywhere in the free world where the jury foreman conspires with the defendant to prevent the court from hearing any evidence? Sounds like Russia or China not a country governed by rule of law.,2020-01-21 16:03:54,Twitter Web App,2014,4842
McConnell’s resolution is not one for a fair and full trial—it’s one to enforce a cover-up. They’re trying to hide the evidence in the dead of night &amp; block witnesses who know what happened.,2020-01-21 01:15:58,Twitter for iPhone,1450,3780
Today we honor the incredible legacy of an incredible American. Someone who showed us that every individual can change a nation and that it’s on each of us to do the work of bending the arc towards justice. Thank you Dr. King. #MLKDay #MLKDay2020 https://t.co/rSMDyEeb1E,2020-01-20 20:18:21,Twitter for iPhone,57,279
