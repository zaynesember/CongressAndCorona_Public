A reminder that if we want a government that actually works #ForThePeople we need to completely rethink how elections are financed in this country. https://t.co/2QHsBeyB7f,2020-02-12 15:40:43,Twitter Web App,111,282
Every American should benefit from automatic voter registration like we do in Oregon. This is great news out of Virginia. If your elected officials aren’t making voting more accessible choose new elected officials this November. https://t.co/ICWHwivYPc,2020-02-11 20:22:28,Twitter Web App,99,380
Student debt is a national economic crisis and Trump's solution is to make it worse. I won't let that happen. https://t.co/NcFQysjrUk,2020-02-11 17:47:06,Twitter Web App,80,252
If a budget reflects your values what does it say about Donald Trump that his budget will cut education health care food stamps scientific research environmental protections and foreign aid? https://t.co/4NFzmfzbng,2020-02-11 15:52:09,Twitter Web App,106,157
We should definitely elect someone else president in November.,2020-02-06 18:21:51,Twitter Web App,173,1021
Senate Republicans just committed a political cover-up on national television.   Remember this moment.  Sear it into your memory.  And then vote them out on November 3.,2020-02-05 22:00:04,Twitter Web App,334,1078
Trump has no health care plan.  Pass it on. https://t.co/OnNUsSyh1B,2020-02-05 20:20:09,Twitter Web App,1237,2066
I just announced that I’ll be fighting to change how every future impeachment trial will be conducted. We must reverse the dangerous precedent Mitch McConnell just set and ensure that every impeachment moving forward has a full and fair trial with witnesses and documents.,2020-02-05 20:03:42,Twitter Web App,260,1190
Ready to make this Donald Trump's last #SOTU?  Chip in $20.20 now and help me fight for Democrats up and down the ballot: https://t.co/rbxMEqs6Sn,2020-02-05 01:18:11,Twitter Web App,33,64
Tonight the very first votes of 2020 will be cast. No matter what happens I’m deeply grateful to the candidates and organizers giving it their all to reclaim the WH. At the end of the day we are one team committed to righting the wrongs of a cruel administration. #IACaucus,2020-02-03 21:12:08,Twitter Web App,40,301
51 U.S. Senators just put party over country. The foundation of government is crumbling.  We must take back the Senate.,2020-01-31 23:53:18,Twitter Web App,386,1451
Imagine a world where government isn't broken. A world where we have 100 Senators that uphold their oaths of office and fight for the PEOPLE. If that's a world you believe in then pick a challenger and help them flip the Senate. Welcome to the race @ReverendWarnock. #GAsen https://t.co/XSgAHW15FC,2020-01-31 05:01:43,Twitter Web App,115,382
I’m at a complete loss of words at this argument but ridiculous preposterous and dangerous are all coming to mind. https://t.co/dHTCsmayL2,2020-01-30 02:46:14,Twitter Web App,174,700
Keep the pressure up America. It’s working. Demand a fair and full trial. https://t.co/9SJkNYR9Qd,2020-01-29 00:01:20,Twitter Web App,243,1119
It’s my sincere honor Yasmin. We will keep fighting until every American’s reproductive health and freedom is protected. Proud to be in this fight with @PPact + @PPAdvocatesOR. https://t.co/xp8HvB4HU8,2020-01-28 22:35:46,Twitter Web App,11,58
My takeaway from today? We must call witnesses. https://t.co/nPvWrJhvD5,2020-01-28 02:34:47,Twitter Web App,125,545
Public pressure matters. Please keep it up. You can change votes. https://t.co/rR6OAGhMdi,2020-01-22 19:49:09,Twitter Web App,118,349
I'm proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with @PPact and more importantly with the women of Oregon to make sure everyone has access to the health care they need without interference from politicians.,2020-01-21 17:58:42,Twitter Web App,8,40
I am honored to earn the support of @PPFA. Planned Parenthood has delivered critical health care to millions of women for years—nobody knows better what's at stake. https://t.co/2ElMdPcYfh,2020-01-21 17:58:42,Twitter Web App,11,73
We wouldn’t be facing the crisis of democracy that we face today if Citizens United hadn’t opened the floodgates to dark money and special interests. Our biggest challenges have to start with ending Citizens United. https://t.co/yKhqCNtqPc,2020-01-21 17:33:13,Twitter Web App,75,302
Each of us can make a difference with what we do with our lives. We can uphold the light and keep darkness at bay or we can stand on the sidelines of history and let our course be charted for us. Which of these paths will you choose? #MLKDay https://t.co/bodn8VCiGm,2020-01-20 15:02:02,Twitter Media Studio,121,351
