After @SpeakerVos and @SenFitzgerald needlessly put politics ahead of the health and safety of Wisconsinites two weeks ago (👇) they're at it again today with their political power grab of a lawsuit. The Badger State deserves better. https://t.co/hSwpy2BmVx,2020-04-21 23:13:49,Twitter Web App,45,152

Wisconsin's election should be safe &amp; fair but GOP state legislative leaders haven't provided voters w/safety &amp; fairness. The state legislature should take action to postpone the election &amp; remove barriers to safe voting by mail so more voters can vote not less. #WIMarchForward,2020-04-02 18:56:10,Twitter for Android,206,579
