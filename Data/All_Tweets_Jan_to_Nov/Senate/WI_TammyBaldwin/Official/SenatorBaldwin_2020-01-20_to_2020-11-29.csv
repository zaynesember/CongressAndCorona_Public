I support an impeachment trial that is full fair and honest but Mitch McConnell’s rules don't guarantee that we will have critical documents and relevant witnesses with firsthand knowledge about the President’s actions abusing his power and obstructing Congress. https://t.co/O2hsbxLjiY,2020-01-22 18:01:58,Twitter Media Studio,216,747
47 years ago #RoevWade protected the freedom of women to make their own health decisions.   Today women’s reproductive rights are under attack. Some politicians think they know better than women &amp; their doctors but they don’t.   Let's stand together and protect #RoevWade,2020-01-22 17:54:01,TweetDeck,33,109
I’m asking all U.S. Military branches for answers on when veterans &amp; advocates will get the info they need. Every day that a board decision is delayed is a day that a veteran may be without access to benefits they have earned. https://t.co/NxpCeznjZp https://t.co/bbmqmSw4dY,2020-01-22 15:43:22,Twitter Web App,7,18
The Pentagon has held up information that helps veterans &amp; their advocates. Without access to this information veterans and the advocacy groups working on their behalf are left in the dark. https://t.co/4NVJrgqAe7,2020-01-22 15:37:32,Twitter Web App,16,35
As Senators we took an oath to do impartial justice but Majority Leader McConnell is setting up a trial without critical documents and relevant witnesses. It is not our job to support and defend President Trump our job is to support and defend the Constitution.,2020-01-22 00:55:54,TweetDeck,1116,4789
Majority Leader McConnell clearly doesn't think much of the President's defense team. He’s doing everything he can to make Senate Republicans support and defend this President against impeachment for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. What happened to impartial justice?,2020-01-22 00:33:48,TweetDeck,69,261
Thanks to Attorney General Kaul @WisDOJ for showing leadership and doing the right thing in working towards true justice for the survivors of sexual assault and accountability for those that committed crimes against them. https://t.co/h74MoiVfk1,2020-01-21 17:50:01,TweetDeck,11,32
Corporate special interests have way too much power in Washington. We must #EndCitizensUnited and put our democracy back where it belongs: in the hands of the American people.  So proud to receive an A from @StopBigMoney. https://t.co/4cyq2VDXyU,2020-01-21 14:52:58,TweetDeck,29,95
Glad to spend this #MLKDay in Beloit and Madison.   Today and every day we must remember Dr. King’s legacy and honor his lifelong commitment to serving others &amp; making a difference in people’s lives. https://t.co/lyHpa8F9V2,2020-01-20 19:39:37,Twitter for iPhone,9,56
