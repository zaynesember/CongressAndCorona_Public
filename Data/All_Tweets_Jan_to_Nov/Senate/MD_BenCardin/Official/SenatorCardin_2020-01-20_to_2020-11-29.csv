Accountability is critical to rebuilding trust between law enforcement &amp; the communities they serve. It shouldn't be tied to public videos &amp; outcry rather than doing the right thing.

Gun violence reflects long-standing racial inequities in America as black Americans are 10x more likely to die by guns than white Americans.

It's time for AG Barr to resign.   For over a year he's taken every chance to prove that he's serving as @POTUS' personal attorney rather than the people’s lawyer.

.@POTUS once again has failed to lead. He continuously fans the flames of racism and seeks to divide Americans for political purposes. He seems blind to the reason people are protesting in the first place: to end the repeated and tragic targeting of blacks by law enforcement.,2020-06-02 02:52:35,Twitter for iPhone,23,120
Spraying tear gas at peaceful protesters to clear a path for a photo op is antithetical to American values and basic human rights. It violates civil and human rights under any circumstances.,2020-06-02 02:52:34,Twitter for iPhone,214,920

Withdrawing from WHO will have serious consequences for our nation &amp; the global fight against #COVID19.
