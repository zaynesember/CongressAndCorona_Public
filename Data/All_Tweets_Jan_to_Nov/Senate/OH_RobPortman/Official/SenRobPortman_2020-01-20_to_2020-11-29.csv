Yesterday @SenatorCarper &amp; I released a stunning investigative report revealing that for nearly 20yrs the fed gov’t has done little to protect U.S. telecommunications networks from abuse by the Chinese government.

Ohio's 8 beautiful nat'l parks attract millions of visitors annually.  But sadly yrs of unaddressed wear &amp; tear have resulted in $114M in unmet maintenance needs.  The Restore Our Parks Act will help address this problem &amp; ensure our nat'l parks are preserved for years to come.,2020-06-10 21:39:00,Twitter for Advertisers (legacy),10,73
This week the Senate will have an historic opportunity to safeguard a true treasure of this country: our national parks.   The Restore Our Parks Act will support more than 100k jobs while ensuring our nat’l parks are preserved &amp; protected for years to come. https://t.co/MCTVd1kuMb,2020-06-10 19:24:44,Twitter Media Studio,7,65
Teddy Roosevelt started the nat'l parks because he wanted to preserve some of the most beautiful &amp; pristine lands in America for public use.

With our country starting to safely re-open we need to put in place policies to help incentivize folks to return to the workplace.

The coronavirus pandemic has made it abundantly clear that we can no longer rely on China for critical medical supplies such as PPE.  That's why during today’s @HSGAC hearing I urged Adm John Polowczyk to ensure the Admin works diligently to bring PPE production back to the US. https://t.co/0OTdjztaMN,2020-06-10 00:28:19,Twitter Media Studio,23,110

7. Telecommunications is a core tenet of nat'l &amp; economic security. And the US govt has a responsibility to vigorously safeguard our telecoms infrastructure. In this respect it has failed for yrs.   We must have stronger oversight to protect our telecoms networks going forward.,2020-06-09 17:01:28,Twitter Web App,27,66
This can not be allowed to continue. The FCC should expeditiously complete its review of the three Chinese state-owned telecom companies in the US and must establish a clear protocol for revoking authorizations if need be.,2020-06-09 17:01:28,Twitter Web App,30,71
5. The lack of oversight poses a grave threat to US nat'l security.   China uses its state-owned entities in its espionage efforts targeted at the US &amp; one of the Chinese state-owned carriers was alleged to have hijacked and rerouted data through China on several occasions.,2020-06-09 17:01:28,Twitter Web App,28,63
4. For instance Team Telecom only visited China Telecom Americas &amp; ComNet USA twice over the course of a decade. And it had no interaction with China Unicom Americas…   Remember these are Chinese state-owned companies operating in the U.S.,2020-06-09 17:00:06,Twitter Web App,27,63
3. But Team Telecom been asleep at the switch for nearly 20 years—in large part due to the fact that it lacked statutory authority and sufficient resources.   With no guards at the gate Chinese state-owned companies have built a presence across the US w/ little-to-no oversight.,2020-06-09 16:59:11,Twitter Web App,28,65
2. The FCC is tasked w safeguarding the integrity of US telecoms infrastructure... but it relied on ‘Team Telecom’ - an informal interagency group consisting of DOJ DHS &amp; DOD officials - to evaluate and monitor national security &amp; law enforcement risks.,2020-06-09 16:59:11,Twitter Web App,29,67
1. Multiple Chinese state-owned telecom companies have been operating in the US for roughly 2 decades w little to no gov’t oversight.  This lack of scrutiny undermined the safety of American communications and seriously endangered U.S. national security...So how did this happen?,2020-06-09 16:59:10,Twitter Web App,37,81
This morning @SenatorCarper &amp; I released a report on how Chinese state-owned telecoms companies have operated in the US w/ a stunning lack of US gov't oversight.  This is the culmination of a yr long Senate Permanent Subcmte on Investigations probe. Here are the key takeaways:,2020-06-09 16:57:06,Twitter for Advertisers (legacy),939,951
For nearly 20 yrs federal regulators have failed to adequately scrutinize several Chinese state-owned telecom companies operating in the US.

@UofMaryland Last year as chairman of the Permanent Subcmte on Investigations I released a bipartisan report that detailed the lack of transparency at Chinese-funded Confucius Institutes located at more than 100 US universities.  https://t.co/SphESkUTLJ,2020-01-26 17:29:10,Twitter Web App,25,62
Confucius Institutes are controlled funded &amp; mostly staffed by the Chinese Gov’t w/o reciprocity or transparency.   I'm pleased the @UofMaryland is taking action &amp; closing their Confucius Institute.
