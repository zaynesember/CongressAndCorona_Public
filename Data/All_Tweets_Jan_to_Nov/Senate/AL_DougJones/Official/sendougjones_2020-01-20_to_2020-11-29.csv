That's why we put in place certain eviction protections for vulnerable renters—but we need to *enforce* them and prevent these folks from losing their homes. https://t.co/SkgiwdRSjL,2020-07-22 17:30:06,Twitter Web App,42,105
In Alabama 22% of COVID cases are from people under the age of 25. Y'all this isn’t just the “sniffles"—the after effects of COVID can be devastating &amp; disruptive to young people as well.

Alabama is a leader in auto manufacturing so why not health care manufacturing too? My Build Health Care Equipment in America Act incentivizes idle plants to repurpose their space to manufacture health care equipment—creating jobs &amp; economic benefits. https://t.co/mOG2z3pDFl,2020-07-20 20:32:43,Twitter for iPhone,62,156
✅Ensure better health outcomes ✅Create jobs ✅Help struggling hospitals ✅No cuts to priority budgets   Folks we need to expand Medicaid—and now is as good as time as any.  https://t.co/PCBxHrxcTt,2020-07-20 19:30:00,Twitter Web App,25,47
Since yesterday Alabama alone has added 1846 new cases. We now have had over 67000 Alabamians test positive for COVID-19. To try &amp; block billions that could fund testing &amp; contract tracing at a time when we need it most is reckless. We can do better.  https://t.co/EjOFN8unug,2020-07-20 18:16:30,Twitter Web App,136,268

Parents students &amp; teachers need to feel safe going back to school.

I can't believe I have to say this but: more COVID-19 cases means more death more strain on struggling hospitals more isolation. We get further from fully reopening our economy.  It's not only irresponsible to welcome the spread of COVID-19 it's dangerous and deadly.,2020-07-11 00:10:50,Twitter for iPhone,179,595
It's important we make sure our students educators &amp; essential staff are armed with the tools to be safe &amp; healthy when schools reopen. This is a great first step.  I urge the Senate to pass my Reopen Schools Safely Act so we can continue to provide support as we reopen schools. https://t.co/t16N61RS4B,2020-07-09 19:30:00,Twitter Web App,39,114
Folks Dr. Fauci is absolutely right. To effectively fight this virus we have to come together and set aside politics—there's no room for that in a public health crisis.  https://t.co/S4QSqwpFNi,2020-07-09 17:30:00,Twitter Web App,160,427

There seems to be an unwillingness from this Administration to call out or even investigate Russia for their bad actions—even when the lives of Americans are at stake.

3 million cases in the U.S. To put into perspective 4.9 million people live in Alabama.

I know we're all eager to do our part to further prevent the spread of COVID-19—but one thing that won’t help is misinformation.

I'm going to continue to be a partner to your work to make sure you can continue to provide a first-class education to the students you serve.  In just 2 years we've secured *permanent* mandatory HBCU funding + a 30% increase in discretionary funding.  #HBCUSummit #FUTUREAct,2020-02-14 16:06:53,Twitter Web App,5,17
There is a certain bond here that is unlike anything else. You can feel it.  HBCUs also provide a foundation upon which to build wealth for communities that have long been shut out from those opportunities.   #HBCUSummit,2020-02-14 16:04:45,Twitter Web App,6,13
Alabama has not only the *most* HBCUs but we have the best!   This #HBCUSummit is an opportunity to showcase their great work and talk about how we can overcome the challenges they face—together.,2020-02-14 16:03:17,Twitter Web App,4,14

12 out of 45 rural Alabama hospitals are considered to be at a high risk of closing—not including the 7 that have closed since 2010.

For the first time in 50 years Alabama is on the verge of losing a seat in Congress unless we get a high turnout for the #2020Census.

In To Kill a Mockingbird Atticus Finch said “The one thing that doesn’t abide by majority rule is a person’s conscience.”  All along my conscience has been my guide.

Senators are elected to make tough choices. We must study the facts &amp; exercise independent judgment in keeping with our oaths.  I've studied the record for months.

The President’s lawyers made some important points today that should be considered esp. regarding obstruction.  However—they also confirmed we need to hear from firsthand witnesses that we can cross-examine to get the full truth.

The Constitution is only as strong as the people who swear an oath to protect it.   We need to hear the truth the full truth and nothing but the truth. That is the only way to ensure a fair and complete trial. https://t.co/ulgKsl7YGN,2020-01-24 17:30:43,Twitter Media Studio,409,1265
I know I'm starting to sound like a broken record but I practiced law for over 40 years and I just can't understand why we shouldn't be able to access witnesses and documents that we know contain relevant information. https://t.co/gV9wcvDiXg,2020-01-23 17:02:29,Twitter Media Studio,6305,24348
The President himself said today that he'd like to have witnesses testify so let's make sure he gets a full fair and complete trial by bringing those folks in for depositions.  Here are a few more of my thoughts from yesterday and a preview of what I'm watching for today 👇 https://t.co/tPwscYbfIq,2020-01-22 17:48:10,Twitter Media Studio,648,1696
I agree w/@SenToomey: @CommerceGov must comply w/the law and release this report. It has yet to explain how Alabama-made cars are a nat'l security threat.   HINT: they're not. This is a delay tactic so they can continue to threaten tariffs on our allies.  https://t.co/z1B5OavoXr,2020-01-22 00:49:11,Twitter Web App,59,87
These proposed rules have this trial taking place in the middle of the night without any guarantee for relevant documents and witnesses.
