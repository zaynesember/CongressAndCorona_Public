By the age of 12 more than two-thirds of kids have their own smartphone and more than twice as many young people watch videos every day than did in 2015.

The U.S. has a long &amp; complicated history of undermining democracies in Latin America &amp; we cannot allow the Anez transitional government to use American military intervention as a threat. Bolivian sovereignty &amp; the will of the Bolivian people must be respected above all else.,2020-01-28 17:04:35,Twitter Web App,10,34
I am deeply concerned about human rights violations after the apparent military-backed coup in Bolivia. The Anez transitional government must repudiate violence &amp; respect the will of the Bolivian people in the upcoming elections that must be free &amp; fair. https://t.co/wvwKvg5PvR,2020-01-28 17:04:34,Twitter Web App,19,60

Muzzling the press is what dictatorships do not the United States of America. Retaliation against NPR or any news outlet for doing their job is authoritarianism and entirely un-American. Secretary Pompeo it’s not personal it’s press. https://t.co/tAImyGz9wY,2020-01-28 02:33:42,Twitter for iPhone,96,247
What we did NOT hear today during the impeachment trial was more telling than what we did. We did not hear the words – John Bolton. The President’s lawyers continued to do what we saw on Saturday: distract distort and deny.  John Bolton must testify. https://t.co/4EP8fRl9bR,2020-01-27 23:54:07,Twitter Media Studio,36,124

The outcome will be inevitably better both for this outbreak and the next if we have in place a single qualified individual to help lead our global health efforts at the highest levels of our federal government. https://t.co/ACbsF5r9YP,2020-01-27 16:52:17,Twitter Web App,23,76
The Coronavirus is not the first and will not be the last biothreat the U.S. faces. I’m calling for the appointment of a global health chief - a position established by President Obama in response to the Ebola crisis then eliminated by President Trump - to address the threat. https://t.co/T06u4tGIlY,2020-01-27 16:52:16,Twitter Web App,143,389
Republican Senators simply cannot justify blocking John Bolton’s impeachment testimony which cuts at the heart of the President’s defense. They have a choice – join the call for witnesses in this trial or be a co-conspirator in Donald Trump’s cover-up.,2020-01-27 16:27:35,Twitter Web App,34,122
I call on Republican Senators to explain now why this doesn’t matter. How can you justify forgoing John Bolton’s testimony? https://t.co/OAzGxyJsHM,2020-01-27 01:43:07,Twitter for iPhone,49,193
Regarding Bangladesh which hosts over 742000 Rohingya refugees according to UNHCR where are you on making a genocide determination @SecPompeo?

If Republican Senators are getting bored it’s not because of the evidence it’s because they don’t want to see the evidence.   Today I joined @SenSchumer and my @SenateDems colleagues to discuss day four of President Trump’s impeachment trial. Watch below. https://t.co/QZxFTANeoT https://t.co/vUI93nILor,2020-01-24 17:59:52,Twitter Web App,16,46
What we’ve heard over the last 3 days of the impeachment trial is a scalding indictment of a President who abused his power and is trying to cover it up.  We can only imagine how much more damning the case would be if we had the documents and witnesses Democrats are asking for. https://t.co/OHIVzATTC0,2020-01-24 17:35:09,Twitter Media Studio,197,611
Tesla can and must do more to guarantee the safety of its misleadingly named “Autopilot” system.

Donald Trump and the ultra-wealthy he met with at Davos want to raid Social Security (and Medicare Medicaid and any program that gives working people the benefits they’ve earned) to give themselves another greedy tax break.   We must fight to EXPAND Social Security not cut it. https://t.co/LlPvY019WV,2020-01-24 16:35:02,Twitter Media Studio,177,282
The presentations we’ve heard were full of undisputed facts. If what President Trump did is not impeachable then what is?   I’m with @SenSchumer and my @SenateDems colleagues ahead of day four of the Senate impeachment trial: https://t.co/9a0Pg34Di8,2020-01-24 16:09:23,Twitter Web App,13,51
If Senate Republicans do not make President Trump accountable they will essentially be giving future presidents carte blanche to do whatever they want. The standard of impeachability will have been absolutely eliminated. https://t.co/dArJa9f7uE,2020-01-24 15:33:35,Twitter Media Studio,22,79
.@SenWarren @RepPressley and I are deeply troubled by the manner in which CBP handled the detention and removal of Northeastern student Shahab Dehghani. We’re demanding CBP provide answers on a pattern of targeting Iranian students for inspection and removal from the U.S. https://t.co/8GfovcxZTh,2020-01-23 17:52:11,Twitter Web App,224,751
Today the Trump administration is going to strip away federal clean water protections from half of U.S. wetlands and thousands of streams clearing the way for polluters to poison our water.

Clearview’s facial recognition technology poses chilling privacy risks.

With the facts now being clearly presented and without the distraction deflection and denial of the President’s legal team the pressure on Republican senators to conduct a fair trial is continuing to build.,2020-01-23 16:20:02,Twitter Web App,11,37
The House Managers have made a compelling case based on facts and evidence. They have placed a heavy burden on the President’s legal team to do much more than they did on day one and respond to this evidence and the gaps in it that point to the need for documents and witnesses.,2020-01-23 16:20:02,Twitter Web App,10,37
The compelling fact-based presentations made by the House Managers were a stark contrast to the conspiratorial factually unbound arguments we heard at the beginning of the impeachment trial from President Trump’s legal team.,2020-01-23 16:20:01,Twitter Web App,21,75

Trump's “Remain in Mexico” policy has resulted in at least 816 cases of murder and other violent assaults against asylum seekers. Forcing migrants to remain in Mexico is a death sentence for some.

CBP did not provide me any answers for why it refused entry to Shahab Dehghani. This case is part of a disturbing pattern from the Trump admin of targeting Iranian students.

The question before the Senate now is: Will we fulfill our constitutional duty by conducting a fair impeachment trial that considers ALL the relevant evidence or will Republicans prevent that by participating in President Trump’s obstruction and cover-up.,2020-01-22 13:16:44,Twitter Web App,10,59
A trial without documents and witnesses isn’t a trial at all it’s a cover-up. You don’t have to be a trial lawyer to understand this. All you need is common sense. Documents tell a story. And they don’t lie.,2020-01-22 13:16:44,Twitter Web App,50,232
Senator McConnell’s idea of a fair trial - No evidence no witnesses debate under the cover of darkness in the deep hours of the night.   The cover-up to end all cover-ups. https://t.co/GG6b47uFoA,2020-01-21 03:48:05,Twitter for iPhone,69,211
