Over 50 million people have filed for unemployment since March. 20 million are at risk of being evicted.   Meanwhile the 467 billionaires in our country have made $731 billion in profits since the start of this pandemic.   We demand economic justice.,2020-08-08 00:44:24,Twitter for iPhone,148,624

We must ensure all students have reliable internet and the resources they need to learn. That’s why I authored the E-Rate program in 1996 and secured tens of billions for schools and libraries.

Economic justice can’t wait. That’s why I am co-sponsoring the Racial and Economic Equity Act to eliminate racial disparities in employment wages wealth and credit.

Joe Kennedy has served on the board of a Super PAC since 2017.  But earlier in this election he said he's against Super PACs.  Now he's embracing "dark money."  Is it conviction or political convenience? https://t.co/2Y06XCThEN,2020-08-07 14:42:55,Twitter Media Studio,307,1409

That’s why I introduced legislation to expand E-Rate and provide $4 billion to purchase WiFi hotspots for students who lack internet at home. And it’s why I introduced the National Broadband Act of 2020 to expand broadband infrastructure and finally guarantee internet for all.,2020-08-06 22:53:14,Twitter Web App,23,93
It’s time to expand this program. Students need access to internet at home—to attend class to complete homework and to learn. Just as education is a human right so is the access to the means of education. That is clear now more than ever.,2020-08-06 22:47:39,Twitter Web App,24,119
In 1996 I introduced the revolutionary E-Rate program which brought internet to low-income schools and public libraries across the country. In Massachusetts we’ve provided over $400 million in 24 years to help get students and educators online.,2020-08-06 22:42:13,Twitter Web App,21,159
Right now we are facing a homework gap in our country. 16 million students do not have access to internet at home.

Our country couldn’t get PPE to nurses or ventilators to patients but we could get weapons of war to every police department in America.   This country cannot keep investing in systems that kill instead of systems that heal.  Demilitarize the police.,2020-06-06 23:24:34,Twitter for iPhone,2171,7814
We must ban the use of tear gas by law enforcement. Tear gas is an indiscriminate weapon that was banned in warfare nearly 100 years ago. It is insane that we allow police to use it against protestors today.,2020-06-06 13:24:10,Twitter for iPhone,8236,33220

Qualified immunity forces victims and their families into an unjust Catch-22 with most cases dismissed outright.   Many victims will not even try to make their case due to this impossible burden.   The system is rigged.,2020-06-04 23:39:18,Twitter Web App,76,377

Qualified immunity is one of the foremost tools of racist oppression. It is a legal doctrine that protects police from being sued and held liable by victims of police violence effectively shielding officers from accountability.,2020-06-04 23:29:28,Twitter Web App,1248,3927

The Trump administration has consistently sought to undermine net neutrality. In 2017 Trump appointed Ajit Pai a former Verizon lawyer as the chairman of the FCC. As expected Trump and Pai immediately got to work dismantling net neutrality protections.,2020-05-18 22:42:39,Twitter Web App,3,75

Debemos ser un gobierno del pueblo por el pueblo y para el pueblo.,2020-03-11 00:20:57,Twitter for iPhone,2,13
Debemos asegurarnos de que todos tengan voz en nuestro gobierno. El New Deal for New Americans fortalecerá nuestra democracia a través del registro automático de nuevos ciudadanos.,2020-03-11 00:18:18,Twitter for iPhone,2,10
También crearemos una beca para el desarrollo del esfuerzo laboral que le da a los refugiados los recursos que necesitan para tener éxito.,2020-03-11 00:11:57,Twitter for iPhone,2,6
Debemos dar a todos una oportunidad igual de alcanzar el sueño americano. Por eso crearemos un programa de educación en inglés para ayudar a los trabajadores inmigrantes a obtener un diploma de equivalencia de escuela superior y prepararse para la naturalización.,2020-03-11 00:08:54,Twitter for iPhone,3,8
Para cumplir con la promesa de nuestra nación de proveer justicia igualitaria bajo la ley crearemos un fondo de ayuda legal para los inmigrantes para asegurar que todos conozcan sus derechos y tengan los recursos para ejercerlos.,2020-03-11 00:06:07,Twitter for iPhone,2,7
Mientras aspiramos a alcanzar las palabras inscritas en la Estatua de la Libertad–“Denme sus masas cansadas pobres y acurrucadas que anhelan respirar libres”–aumentaremos la cuota de admisión de refugiados y pondremos fin a la norma discriminatoria de la carga pública.,2020-03-11 00:03:07,Twitter for iPhone,2,8
Necesitamos un camino hacia la ciudadanía para todos. El New Deal for New Americans creará una oficina ejecutiva en la Casa Blanca para reducir las barreras a la ciudadanía y promover y apoyar la inclusión de inmigrantes y refugiados.  https://t.co/WiBAyvAYuH,2020-03-10 23:59:21,Twitter for iPhone,9,27
Our first priority is the health and safety of voters volunteers and our staff. That is why we fully support @MassDems Chairman Bickford’s decision to postpone the remaining Democratic caucuses.  Please see this important update from campaign manager @JohnEWalsh14. #COVID19 https://t.co/niOvuqrdPI,2020-03-10 22:44:05,Twitter for iPhone,13,38
Thank you @32BJSEIU for standing with our movement in the fight for economic and environmental justice. https://t.co/y2eGXMHtw6,2020-03-10 21:24:52,Twitter Web App,19,73
We must be a government of the people by the people and for the people.,2020-03-10 20:39:54,Twitter Web App,1,11
We must ensure that everyone has a voice in our government.  The New Deal for New Americans will strengthen our democracy through automatic voter registration of new citizens.,2020-03-10 20:27:36,Twitter Web App,2,19
We must give everyone an equal shot at the American Dream.  That’s why we will create an English education program to help immigrant workers earn a GED and prepare for naturalization and a Workforce Development Grant that gives refugee the resources they need to succeed.,2020-03-10 20:23:03,Twitter Web App,3,19
To fulfill our nation’s promise to provide equal justice under the law we will create a legal aid fund for immigrants to ensure that everyone knows their rights and has the resources to exercise them.,2020-03-10 20:17:23,Twitter Web App,4,24
As we aspire to live up to the words inscribed on the Statue of Liberty—”Give me your tired your poor your huddled masses yearning to breathe free”—we will raise the quota for refugee admissions and put an end to the discriminatory public charge rule.,2020-03-10 20:12:58,Twitter Web App,6,24
We need a pathway to citizenship for all. The New Deal for New Americans will create an executive office in the White House to reduce barriers to citizenship and promote and support immigrant and refugee inclusion. https://t.co/UCedYIw8vg,2020-03-10 20:09:29,Twitter Web App,30,136
Oil and gas companies don’t need a bailout. The millions of Americans who can't afford medical treatment or sick leave do. https://t.co/Qp0I9ANA00,2020-03-10 19:27:44,Twitter Web App,216,740
In the age of Donald Trump getting involved in politics is more important than ever. It's up to young people to stand up for what is right and drive the change we need—thank you to @StudentsState for leading that charge! https://t.co/5QuQsHMvkp,2020-03-10 15:17:54,Twitter Web App,12,44
I'm inspired to see so many friends from #TeamWarren joining our grassroots movement. I know your hearts are hurting you fought like hell and deserve a break. Together we will keep fighting righteous fights for a Green New Deal Medicare for All and big structural change.,2020-03-09 22:38:58,Twitter Web App,296,2637
15 years ago I wrote the bill that extended Daylight Savings Time. The change helped Americans save hundreds of millions of dollars on energy bills and reduced oil consumption by millions of barrels.  The extra sunshine is a nice bonus. https://t.co/yyQNkgdlQs,2020-03-09 19:08:24,Twitter Web App,12,107
We must do more to ensure the fairness and justness of our criminal justice system and to support the communities most affected by incarceration. That’s a commitment that my friends and I hold close to our hearts. https://t.co/cHdzA8U8x6,2020-03-09 18:39:23,Twitter for iPhone,8,37
We do not have a criminal justice system. We have an injustice system. We are at the BC Law Rappaport Center to discuss how we can reform and transform our criminal justice system. https://t.co/0LYyvLfAJV,2020-03-09 16:44:43,Twitter for iPhone,7,50
Thank you to the activists and organizers who came out to caucus this weekend. For the fourth week in a row we saw wins across the state that demonstrate the strength of our movement. https://t.co/Hskw72hR2N,2020-03-09 13:58:24,Twitter Media Studio,19,121
Yet the women’s movement is stronger than ever. In 2018 a record shattering number of women ran for office–and won. They are paving the way for future female leaders and a more representative and just democracy.,2020-03-09 00:33:19,Twitter Web App,5,28
Women hold fewer than 25% of seats in Congress. And even though a record number of women ran for the presidency this year we still have yet to elect our first female president.,2020-03-09 00:25:44,Twitter Web App,11,41
Meanwhile abortion rights are under attack. After nearly 50 years of precedent Roe v. Wade is as close as it has ever come to being rolled back and funding for reproductive healthcare services is being slashed.,2020-03-09 00:22:31,Twitter Web App,3,24
Women also face discrimination in the health system. Women’s pain is taken less seriously than men’s and the concerns of women of color in particular are regularly dismissed by providers. The maternal mortality rate for black women is more than 3 times that of white women.,2020-03-09 00:19:52,Twitter Web App,5,23
Women still make 77 cents on average to a man’s dollar. Black women make 63 cents to a white man’s dollar. Latinas make 53 cents to a white man’s dollar. If we closed the gender pay gap we could cut the poverty rate for working women and their families in half.,2020-03-09 00:17:06,Twitter Web App,7,28
Gender based discrimination impacts all aspects of a woman’s life from the personal to the professional and the political. We will fight for social and economic justice and guarantee women’s rights and autonomy. #InternationalWomensDay https://t.co/GccRzLBhLN,2020-03-09 00:14:11,Twitter Web App,17,114
But women are leading the way toward peace. Pakistani activist @Malala defends girls’ education in the face of war. Climate activist @JaneFonda also speaks out against global conflict. And closer to home @marudehar and @masspeaceaction push for more peaceful US foreign policy.,2020-03-09 00:09:12,Twitter Web App,3,23
Conflict also drives gender based discrimination and inequity. During periods of violence girls are often taken out of schools or prevented from receiving an education.,2020-03-09 00:05:47,Twitter Web App,5,21
Women make up the largest share of refugees and people displaced by conflict. Displaced women and those in conflict areas are more vulnerable to physical and sexual abuse. One in five refugee women is estimated to have experienced sexual violence.,2020-03-09 00:04:34,Twitter Web App,4,19
It is estimated that about 70% of those killed in today’s conflicts are civilians mainly women and children. As of November 2019 335000 civilians in Iraq Afghanistan Yemen Syria and Pakistan were killed as a result of war.,2020-03-09 00:01:39,Twitter Web App,4,22
Women are often the ones most affected by war and conflict. We will fight to put a stop to endless wars end nuclear proliferation and create a free and peaceful world for all. #InternationalWomensDay https://t.co/Hwbooi5VxQ,2020-03-08 23:57:30,Twitter Web App,23,119
But women are also leading the movement to end gun violence. From @MomsDemand to Congresswoman @lucymcbath to former Congresswoman @GabbyGiffords and @ChaplainChery women are rising up to demand an end to the epidemic of gun violence in our country.,2020-03-08 23:50:24,Twitter Web App,6,24
Women in the United States are 21 times more likely to die from firearm homicides than women in other wealthy nations.,2020-03-08 23:46:47,Twitter Web App,12,28
On average 52 women are shot and killed by an intimate partner per month. Nearly 1 million American women alive today have reported being shot or shot at by an intimate partner. 4.5 million have been threatened with a gun.,2020-03-08 23:35:48,Twitter Web App,8,27
Gun violence is inextricably tied to intimate partner violence and violence against women. We must commit to passing common sense gun safety legislation and universal background checks to keep guns out of the hands of abusers and end gun violence. #InternationalWomensDay https://t.co/tEjcwgRaTv,2020-03-08 23:28:17,Twitter Web App,57,166
Women and girls are also leading the fight to combat the climate crisis. @VarshPrakash founded the Sunrise Movement. @GretaThunberg is a leader of the climate movement worldwide. And other groups like @MothersOutFront are leading the fight for environmental justice.,2020-03-08 23:16:57,Twitter Web App,7,31
Pollution and contamination contribute to worsening health particularly for women. The growing prevalence of asthma for teen girls is attributed to the climate crisis. Rising temperatures food insecurity &amp; other symptoms of the climate crisis increase maternal mortality rates.,2020-03-08 23:13:38,Twitter Web App,5,34
Extreme weather events disproportionately affect poor populations. Women make up 70% of the world’s poor.   80% of people displaced by climate change are women.,2020-03-08 23:10:57,Twitter Web App,6,31
Environmental destruction fuels violence against women and contributes to conflicts and war.,2020-03-08 23:08:54,Twitter Web App,7,28
Globally women face the harshest consequences of the climate crisis. We will fight to pass a Green New Deal and stand up for environmental justice everywhere. #InternationalWomensDay https://t.co/3THzjkO18Y,2020-03-08 23:07:12,Twitter Web App,29,150
When injustice occurs it hits women the hardest. This International Women's Day we recognize the threats that women face around the world commit to fighting for a world free of these injustices and celebrate the women who are already leading the way. #InternationalWomensDay https://t.co/7CGCSTHvju,2020-03-08 23:00:07,Twitter Web App,10,75
We need your help to restock the ice cream truck and fight for bold climate action in the Senate https://t.co/v9fdQrHTGT https://t.co/0pNFgJHWeR,2020-03-08 03:06:01,Twitter Web App,66,460
