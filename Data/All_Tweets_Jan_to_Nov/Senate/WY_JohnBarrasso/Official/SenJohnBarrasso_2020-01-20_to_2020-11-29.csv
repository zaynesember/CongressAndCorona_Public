Our economy is doing so well &amp; consumer confidence is so high that impeachment is the only thing Democrats can do to try to beat @realDonaldTrump. The momentum among Republican senators is clearly moving toward ending this trial. https://t.co/7ryB3pYait,2020-01-29 15:10:26,Twitter Media Studio,571,2132
.@realDonaldTrump’s team made a very strong compelling case. We need to get back to the work of the American people. We’ve heard enough we can make an informed decision and judgement. Let’s vote. https://t.co/Z6K18h5SZU,2020-01-29 01:26:39,Twitter Media Studio,222,702
The American people have heard enough &amp; have lost interest in the impeachment process. People realize this is partisan &amp; political. I’m comfortable making a decision on the impeachment of @realDonaldTrump without hearing additional witnesses or seeing additional documents. https://t.co/UMIBgB8PmL,2020-01-28 20:45:25,Twitter Media Studio,440,1524
We’re going to decide Friday on witnesses but this will not be a one-sided issue. We’ll decide if we’ve heard enough if we’re ready to have a final judgment on @realDonaldTrump or whether we need to hear from more people. https://t.co/WLzodgvbdf,2020-01-28 00:11:18,Twitter Media Studio,190,621
The House could have called all these witnesses and chose not to. As senators we have a responsibility to not allow this to become a circus. That’s what Democrats are trying to do. https://t.co/5co5LSG2aQ,2020-01-27 21:21:36,Twitter Media Studio,6671,20600
New information is going to be coming out every day like it did with the Kavanaugh trial. Old information will be told in a different way to inflame emotions &amp; influence the outcome. Let’s take a breath &amp; listen to the case that @realDonaldTrump’s lawyers present. https://t.co/ze1PyyCl36,2020-01-27 17:23:21,Twitter Media Studio,247,824
75 years ago today the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camps were liberated. We honor the lives of those lost during the Holocaust and pledge to never forget. #HolocaustRemembranceDay #NeverAgain https://t.co/f9bqxxWNNE,2020-01-27 16:16:37,Twitter Web App,91,247
Videos @RepAdamSchiff showed repeatedly in the impeachment trial withheld critical information. We will continue to hear about the House Democrats’ flawed process as the team for @realDonaldTrump lays out it’s case. https://t.co/k1ACSg08aC,2020-01-25 20:01:36,Twitter Media Studio,6586,21215
Today we heard a presentation that was strong that was clear &amp; that completely undermined the case of Democrats against @realDonaldTrump &amp; undermined the credibility of @RepAdamSchiff. I look forward to hearing more from the White House team in the coming days. https://t.co/qwMTLdSxnJ,2020-01-25 18:17:12,Twitter Media Studio,6670,22587
Tomorrow the White House will be able to make its case &amp; for the first time the defense of @realDonaldTrump will be made for the public to see.  @SenRickScott @SenatorBraun @SenJoniErnst @SenatorLankford &amp; I gave our thoughts on the impeachment trial today. https://t.co/67vm2igohe,2020-01-25 01:07:21,Twitter Media Studio,7284,23651
Since @realDonaldTrump took office we’ve added 7 million new jobs consumer confidence &amp; the stock market are at all-time highs &amp; wages have gone up. The president has been doing an excellent job for America &amp; will continue to do so. @NBCNews https://t.co/ZEKfRppIiA,2020-01-24 21:12:16,Twitter Media Studio,5701,19060
Wrote in @washingtonpost today about the flaws in having new carbon taxes. A carbon tax won’t reduce costs and it won’t reduce regulation. https://t.co/3TM2IeItOC,2020-01-24 16:16:12,Twitter Web App,60,137
This impeachment trial isn’t just about removing @realDonaldTrump from office. It’s about @SenSchumer trying to become Senate majority leader. @NewDay https://t.co/ouSqC4qABY,2020-01-24 15:35:28,Twitter Web App,111,274
Every day spent on the impeachment of @realDonaldTrump is time not spent on what people actually care about. The longer Democrats drag this out the longer it will take us to get to the work Americans want us to be doing. @MariaBartiromo @FoxBusiness. https://t.co/qr3DK0mMKc,2020-01-24 14:47:39,Twitter Media Studio,90,179
@RepAdamSchiff thinks voters couldn’t be trusted in 2016 &amp; can’t be trusted in 2020. He thinks he should determine who is president. It’s time for voters to speak. @SenatorTimScott @SenJoniErnst @SenatorLankford &amp; I addressed this and more tonight. https://t.co/uMF6UhwPv5,2020-01-24 00:35:17,Twitter Web App,5,8
The old #WOTUS rule was confusing. Even worse it inserted Washington into local decision making. I will continue to work closely with the Trump administration as it seeks commonsense ways to keep America’s water clean and safe. https://t.co/iOiH2dhsTU,2020-01-23 22:35:55,Twitter Web App,52,139
This impeachment vote is about removing the president from office something that has never happened before. This is as serious as it gets &amp; @realDonaldTrump hasn’t even had a chance to present his case yet. I look forward to hearing his defense. #foxnews https://t.co/T4fjnZTE51,2020-01-23 21:18:47,Twitter Media Studio,4690,16638
.@realDonaldTrump is delivering on his promise to give Americans clean water &amp; clear rules. Regulations must follow the law &amp; be easy for Americans to understand. The Trump administration respects the authority Congress gave EPA under the Clean Water Act. https://t.co/Sn9da5moPr,2020-01-23 19:07:38,Twitter Web App,64,211

In voting to remove @realDonaldTrump from office the 4 Senate Democrats running for president have a conflict of interest. Their impeachment vote would remove their opponent from the 2020 ballot. I discussed these &amp; other impeachment details today with @DanaBashCNN. https://t.co/fBliA8CdnU,2020-01-23 16:27:21,Twitter Media Studio,170,386
This whole impeachment charade isn’t just about the president. Democrats also want to remove certain Republican senators from office and take back the Senate. @SenatorTimScott and I talked with the media about this and more. https://t.co/BCV7TjIYlK,2020-01-23 00:36:02,Twitter Media Studio,309,778
Today on @NBCNews I discussed how @SpeakerPelosi sat on the articles of impeachment for 33 days. America has seen this trial for what it is: political stunt. It’s not just about overturning the last election of @realDonaldTrump but going after the next one too. https://t.co/6Bn4HqoEmL,2020-01-22 21:33:33,Twitter Media Studio,11915,36269
On @Varneyco  I talked about Democrats’ impeachment brief which claims 13 times that evidence against @realDonaldTrump is overwhelming. If that were true why do Democrats now claim the Senate needs to hear from more witnesses? https://t.co/iYWP4MgGlQ,2020-01-22 17:38:45,Twitter Media Studio,461,1513
House Democrats’ process was a cover-up.  Ours will be transparent.  Their process was blindly partisan.  Ours will be impartial.  Their process was rigged.  Ours will be FAIR. https://t.co/hse5ks7qut,2020-01-22 15:23:43,Twitter Media Studio,196,493
