Pres. Trump’s rollback of clean water protections is particularly dangerous for NM where we rely on water from impacted “ephemeral” waterways that flow only part of the time. We need to protect NOT pollute the air we breathe and the water we drink. https://t.co/ljxbpq0sn5,2020-01-28 15:58:57,Twitter Web App,41,97
Seventy-five years ago Allied forces liberated the Auschwitz-Birkenau Nazi death camp. Today we remember the survivors &amp; those killed during the Holocaust. We must commit ourselves to preventing future atrocities &amp; protecting refugees from persecution and violence. #NeverAgain,2020-01-28 02:22:58,Twitter Web App,28,113
One of these two is lying. How do we know which one?   Maybe we should cross examine the people who were in the room.   Trials have witnesses... cover-ups do not.  https://t.co/7nJtQSljNZ,2020-01-27 17:50:39,Twitter Web App,50,159
John Bolton’s book publisher shouldn’t have more evidence than we do. Will any of my Republican colleagues vote to hear from Bolton?  Anything less would be a cover up not a trial.,2020-01-27 16:03:50,Twitter Web App,92,362
This is not the first time China has threatened world health because of their wildlife trade.   These changes need to be permanent.   https://t.co/bfzYqBXZNb,2020-01-26 23:13:53,Twitter for iPhone,44,90
China perpetuates the sale of wild animals like civets bats &amp; snakes in food markets. That’s what gave us SARS &amp; now this deadly coronavirus. They are putting endangered wildlife at risk of extinction &amp; they are endangering the lives of people worldwide.  https://t.co/sdAwBubIKp,2020-01-26 21:39:54,Twitter for iPhone,797,898

Trump’s defense: “Cross-examination in our legal system is regarded as the greatest legal engine ever invented for the discovery of truth.”   The irony is that the President’s defense team has resisted every opportunity for witnesses and cross-examination.,2020-01-25 18:51:27,Twitter for iPhone,115,399

President Trump cannot be trusted to keep his campaign promise not to cut Social Security and Medicare. Just look at his budgets. He cares more about giving out $1.5 trillion in tax breaks to his wealthy friends than protecting programs hardworking Americans rely on. https://t.co/xhWjlOg3Zf,2020-01-24 20:38:48,Twitter Web App,47,132

My Republican colleagues are saying that they have heard “nothing new” in the Impeachment Trial. Let me remind you that they spent ALL of Tuesday voting repeatedly to prohibit ANY new witnesses and documents.  They are petrified of witnesses and documents.,2020-01-23 20:03:46,Twitter Web App,490,1696

On this day in 1973 #RoeVWade provided women with the right to choose what is best for her body and well-being. Almost half a century later we must continue to protect Roe v.

President Trump says he is growing the economy but his tax breaks are only growing profits for big corporations and shareholders. They are NOT growing wages for American workers.

The fix is in... Majority Leader McConnell is spending the entire opening day of this trial preventing the Senate and the American people from viewing documentary evidence or hearing from witnesses.,2020-01-22 00:53:32,Twitter for iPhone,293,834
Majority Leader McConnell has created an environment that clearly serves as a cover-up: no witnesses no evidence no press access.   The role of journalism is to "seek truth and report it" and these restrictions deny the American people the full truth.  https://t.co/BcWjP3eHsV,2020-01-21 17:53:29,Twitter Web App,78,160
