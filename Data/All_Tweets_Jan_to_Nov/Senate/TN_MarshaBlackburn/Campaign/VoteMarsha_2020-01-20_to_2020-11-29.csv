Not a single Senate Democrat has spoken out against the corroborated sexual assault allegations facing Joe Biden.  The silence is deafening.  https://t.co/hghhLN9VDl,2020-04-28 19:05:40,TweetDeck,41,111
For Hillary Clinton “breaking the glass ceiling” means endorsing Joe Biden who refuses to acknowledge sexual assaults allegations. https://t.co/wbKqMVjwQ4,2020-04-28 18:12:59,Twitter for iPhone,37,125
Democrats refuse to hold Joe Biden accountable.  They only believe women when it fits their narrative and are eager to sweep Tara Reade under the rug.  She deserves to be heard.,2020-04-28 14:59:22,TweetDeck,625,2158
The hypocrisy from the mainstream media &amp; Democrats is sickening. They gaslit allegations against Justice Brett Kavanaugh but are now eerily silent against Biden. The truth is Democrats only care about “championing” women when it’s convenient for them.  https://t.co/ip1TwHUMlN,2020-04-28 03:18:55,Twitter for iPhone,60,167
