I was impressed by Judge Barrett during the hearings &amp; I look forward to meeting with her in the days ahead.,2020-10-14 23:54:37,Twitter for iPhone,8,69
Not surprised my Democratic colleagues spent another day trying to make Judge Barrett into something she’s not. She’s not Justice Scalia or Justice Ginsburg she’s Judge #AmyConeyBarrett. She was nominated because she’s qualified not because she’s a pawn of a particular party.,2020-10-14 23:54:37,Twitter for iPhone,24,172
Turkey keeps testing their Russian S-400 missile system. NATO allies should behave like allies &amp; must be held accountable when they don’t. Sanctions for S-400 purchases should be implemented as reports keep surfacing of Turkey’s active use w/ no intentions to reverse course.,2020-10-14 21:53:29,Twitter for iPhone,9,39

Great job Oklahoma! We are currently at a 99.9% completion rate for the #2020Census. We have until Friday to get to 100%. I believe in us. Can you remind 5 friends to complete their Census before this Friday? One simple text can make a big different. https://t.co/Y9qIWgtb1b https://t.co/KWG7RYLRcH,2020-10-14 20:26:53,Twitter Web App,7,32
My Dem colleagues demand Judge #AmyConeyBarrett declare her independence from @realdonaldtrump while insisting she pre-commit to how she would rule in a particular case. If the Ginsburg rule is good enough for RBG it should be good enough for Judge Barrett. https://t.co/VgM3NkA1rM,2020-10-13 23:11:57,Twitter Web App,35,214

Everyone should watch Judge Amy Coney Barrett’s opening statement where she introduces herself and gives her judicial philosophy- Dont let people spin who she is actually listen to her in her own words. https://t.co/y3gdwlEnZ0,2020-10-12 20:45:04,Twitter for iPhone,14,84
Judicial confirmation hearings are meant to review a nominee’s qualifications &amp; his or her ability to be an impartial jurist. The court is about the law judges do not make policy. Trying to bully Judge Barrett or putting words in her mouth is unfair for any nominee.,2020-10-12 20:45:03,Twitter for iPhone,13,70
Not a single Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee discussed Judge Barrett’s qualifications in their opening statements. Instead they focused on criticizing @realdonaldtrump &amp; trying to make Americans afraid of Judge Amy Coney Barrett.,2020-10-12 20:45:03,Twitter for iPhone,96,259
Hearings have begun for Judge Barrett. Today the committee will start with opening statements. You can follow along or watch live with the link below. https://t.co/x2EHQ3F8Io,2020-10-12 13:28:52,Twitter for iPhone,6,33
This is a health crisis - we should focus on the health issues and helping those most in need. 92% of Americans are working – there are people and businesses that do need help but lets not make the situation worse with more spending than what is essential.

Went through the details with my colleagues of the WH negotiations with Pelosi over another COVID bill. They are still very far apart. Pelosi and the Democrats are demanding huge sums of taxpayer money and wide latitude on how they want to spend it. (1/2),2020-10-11 12:20:20,Twitter Web App,132,310

Democrats continue to talk about peaceful transition of power but since @realDonaldTrump was elected they wasted tax dollars on a Russia investigation that turned out to be nothing then impeached the President as soon as they took the House. https://t.co/JXMJgI1fN0,2020-10-09 19:29:42,Twitter for iPhone,116,270

10 years ago the Simpson-Bowles Commission report recommended reducing the federal vehicle fleet budget by 20% yet we're still not there. @SenatorShaheen  @SenAngusKing &amp; I introduced the DRIVE LESS Act to save $500M in taxpayer dollars by reducing the federal vehicle stockpile. https://t.co/RBlOuRchKH,2020-10-08 19:17:36,Twitter Web App,5,15

Reports of Turkey activating the radars of its Russian S-400 anti-aircraft system is alarming which is why sanctions for their initial purchase need to be implemented.

I think House Democrats demanded something they knew is unreasonable so they could blame @realDonaldTrump  right before the election. We should approve the areas of common ground-people need help right now but taxpayers do not need to be saddled with another huge bill.  (3/3),2020-10-07 16:26:03,Twitter Web App,27,73

It’s incredibly frustrating that the conversation continues to focus on numbers instead of helping the people that really need it.

Quick update folks. Oklahoma currently has a Census completion rate of 98.2%. That's phenomenal. But let's do better.   Ask five people if they've completed their Census.

The Constitution of the United States makes it clear there is no religious test required as a qualification for any office in the United States. It's straightforward &amp; clear. So why has Judge Amy Coney Barrett's faith become the center of her ability to serve the American people? https://t.co/hbCKPsLKkI,2020-10-01 14:36:52,Twitter Media Studio,80,280

Disappointed but not surprised Senate Dems blocked our targeted #COVID19 relief bill. Only in Washington DC is a $300 BILLION piece of legislation considered 'skinny'.

Passing yet another CR is not good enough. Congress should do its job to fully fund the gov’t &amp; fund it on time. If we can’t then my bill forces Congress to stay in DC until the work is done while holding families and workers harmless.,2020-09-10 16:31:54,Twitter Web App,3,18

Without non-profits &amp; houses of worship government couldn't keep up with the issues we face. Gov't sees needs as numbers on a page local non-profits know each name &amp; need.

Government is the third safety net after families churches &amp; non-profits.   Non-profits &amp; houses of worship are the ones holding up families across the nation- Congress should incentivize people to give to them as they continue to meet the needs of their neighbors. https://t.co/jT2wnXMutY,2020-09-09 21:07:32,Twitter Media Studio,30,96

As China continues to encroach on the freedoms of the people of Hong Kong I want to be clear- the United States stands with the people of #HongKong and will work to preserve their presently-enjoyed liberties.,2020-07-01 21:33:27,Twitter Web App,103,304
The treaty clearly states #HongKong would remain unchanged for 50 years yet after 23 years the most basic human rights of Hongkongers are being threatened in the name of so-called ‘national security’ by the mainland communist Chinese government.,2020-07-01 21:33:26,Twitter Web App,118,294
23 years ago today the Sino-British Joint Declaration treaty went into effect making #HongKong part of China but with a high degree of autonomy. A day before the anniversary Beijing reminded the world they can’t be trusted to fulfill their commitments to other nations.,2020-07-01 21:33:26,Twitter Web App,1394,1864
Yesterday’s arrests in Hong Kong prove how ridiculous &amp; overreaching Beijing’s new national security law is. A person was detained for waving an independence flag another for being a pro-democracy advocate.

What’s in the bill?  → A pay raise for troops  → Funding to help licenses move from state to state for military spouses  → Ensures we won’t have another BRAC round of base closings  → Provides additional supervision for military housing,2020-06-30 20:11:10,Twitter Web App,1,2
For the 60th year in a row Congress will fulfill its duty to pass a bipartisan defense bill. The #NDAA supports our military community in Oklahoma and support for their families. https://t.co/2GBv0o3F3S,2020-06-30 20:04:13,Twitter Media Studio,34,103
Beijing will have consequences for this overreach. The US should use available tools including sanctions against any leader in the CPC implementing Hong Kong security measures.,2020-06-30 19:15:26,Twitter Web App,51,150
One country two systems. That doesn’t work when people don’t have the ability to speak freely petition the government or peacefully protest. We started seeing this within minutes of the law being signed as pro-democracy leaders quit in fear of the new laws.,2020-06-30 19:15:26,Twitter Web App,65,171
China has proved it can't be trusted to uphold commitments. They agreed to 50 years of autonomy  for #HongKong. Beijing’s new security law impedes Hong Kong’s ability to remain autonomous &amp; is a clear approach by communist China to increase power &amp; take control of the territory. https://t.co/kspdiXMk6H,2020-06-30 19:15:25,Twitter Web App,2069,2220

It is Congress’s responsibility to fund the government. If we fail Congress should be held accountable. Gov. shutdowns impede military readiness &amp; put an undue burden on service members &amp; their families. Service members shouldn’t have to worry about putting food on the table.,2020-06-29 22:16:44,Twitter Web App,3,18
I offered 2 amendments to the FY 2021 NDAA: the Taxpayers Right to Know Act &amp; Prevent Gov.

🚨The application deadline for the #PPP is TOMORROW. #PPP has provided over $5.4 BILLION dollars to more than 63600 small businesses in Oklahoma.

It's frustrating Democrats wouldn't even engage &amp; debate the #JUSTICEAct. There is widespread agreement on 70% of bill so it's shocking they weren't open to amending it.

How many times do we have to go through this journey before we finally do something?  It's unfortunate Senate Democrats would rather prolong a problem &amp; make it political &amp; delay justice for families who want this solved. Debate &amp; amend the bill. We can't let it just stop here. https://t.co/qOeBsC3hv5,2020-06-24 22:26:25,Twitter Web App,47,176
I wish that Senator Schumer would allow the Senate to debate and amend the #JUSTICEAct rather than prevent debate and delay justice again for partisan reasons.,2020-06-24 19:30:39,Twitter Web App,4,23
Today we missed an opportunity to increase funding for body-worn cameras ban chokeholds and provide greater accountability and transparency for local law enforcement. The American people deserve better.,2020-06-24 19:30:39,Twitter Web App,2,18
Blocking the Senate from even debating the #JUSTICEAct and demanding that the Senate only take up Speaker Pelosi’s police reform bill that has not even been voted on yet in the House is unjust to every American.,2020-06-24 19:30:38,Twitter Web App,3,8
It’s unfortunate Senate Democrats have allowed partisan politics to get in the way of justice. Equal justice should not be a partisan issue. The #JUSTICEAct has more similarities with the House Democrat bill than differences.,2020-06-24 19:30:38,Twitter Web App,81,221

In times of need we’ve come together &amp; passed overwhelmingly bipartisan bills like our #COVID19 bills &amp; criminal justice reform. Police reform should be no different.    It's time for members of both parties to come together &amp; at least support beginning debate on the #JUSTICEAct,2020-06-24 14:52:20,Twitter Web App,2,15
The #JUSTICEAct  → incentivizes prohibition of chokeholds → improves hiring practices of police departments → provides access to an officer’s records for hiring → makes lynching a federal crime  these are changes we all agree will improve law enforcement across the nation. https://t.co/MTPyQpxXK2,2020-06-24 14:47:13,Twitter Media Studio,4,28
Congress hasn’t passed a major police reform bill like the #JUSTICEAct in 25 years. There’s too much on the line to let partisanship get in the way of answering the American people. I’m hopeful Democrats will join Republicans to begin debate on the floor.,2020-06-23 22:15:00,Twitter Web App,23,94
There is so much we agree on. It makes absolutely no sense to hold up the bill and delay action when we agree on the majority of solutions.   Real long-term solutions &amp; reform are what the American people want. The #JUSTICEAct does just that.,2020-06-23 19:59:37,Twitter Web App,7,28
The #JUSTICEAct &amp; the House bill are 80% the same. Rather than Senate Dems holding it up &amp; demanding we take up the House bill let’s get on the bill debate and vote on amendments.,2020-06-23 19:59:37,Twitter Web App,15,45
When we drafted the #JUSTICEAct we included several bipartisan proposals. If there are more ideas Senate rules provide for debate &amp; amendments. The 1st step in making a law is to move forward w/ debate. If Democrats can’t do that they’re just trying to make a point – not a law https://t.co/VzJhaGZ126,2020-06-23 18:44:44,Twitter Web App,55,142

Every future administration will have to play 'Mother May I?' with every court. Any partisan judge in any court in America can take any opinion or executive action that they don't like and hold up any future president.

This decision attempts to avoid politically difficult issues and drives our legal system into a minefield of future uncertainty. I am greatly disappointed in the Court's decision.,2020-06-18 15:20:32,Twitter Web App,12,82
SCOTUS has now ruled that every future president has to abide by any previous President's Executive Orders unless a court allows them to change it.

This is an opportunity for peace that we have not seen in decades. Both Israelis and Palestinians have been presented with a reasonable proposal as a starting point for negotiations. I hope both parties will embrace this historic opportunity to peacefully settle their differences https://t.co/vzdSGtUNA9,2020-01-28 21:01:35,Twitter Web App,30,185
No one should be afraid when they join together with others to pray &amp; worship. @SenJackyRosen &amp; I are glad to see a bill signed into law to help ensure all houses of worship are as safe &amp; secure as possible. https://t.co/SZhFAlUF0r,2020-01-28 20:45:42,Twitter Web App,15,84

After that is a moment to determine if there is a need for more witnesses or evidence. John Bolton is no shrinking violet if he has insight or information he should share it now.,2020-01-27 23:45:55,Twitter for iPhone,31,164
2 days of argument from the White House counsel has definitively answered many of the questions raised by the House Managers during their 3 days of argument.  Over the next 4 days there will be even more public information and question time in the Senate.,2020-01-27 23:45:55,Twitter for iPhone,66,360
19 Years ago tragedy struck when 10 members of the Oklahoma State Basketball family were killed in a plane crash outside of Denver. Since that tragic day Oklahomans have continually shown the #OklahomaStandard and remember the lives we lost too soon. We will never forget. #RT10 https://t.co/PmUVBAIbHY,2020-01-27 22:00:10,Twitter Web App,15,89
Today we remember the 6 million Jews who died in the  Holocaust and pay tribute to the Americans and Allied Forces who fought to end the Nazi regime. I am grateful for Senator Rosen’s partnership in addressing anti-Semitism through education &amp; remembrance.,2020-01-27 16:15:10,Twitter Web App,9,44
The Holocaust was one of humanity’s darkest hours. 75 years ago we as a nation promised loudly &amp; clearly that this would never happen again. We must continue to stand against anti-Semitism to ensure that no one is persecuted because of their faith or background. https://t.co/jXqSs6uoDw https://t.co/TV2p4Gbk1G,2020-01-27 16:15:09,Twitter Web App,18,68
For 3 days House Managers have cherry picked bits &amp; pieces of information to make their case. Today we got to hear the full story based on full facts instead of presumptions &amp; half-truths. https://t.co/6zErKwjRlU,2020-01-25 18:49:52,Twitter Web App,6470,21332
I’m reminded of Proverbs 18:17 The one who states his case first seems right until the other comes and examines him. For months we’ve only heard one-side of the story. Finally we’ll get to hear the other side of the story. https://t.co/DDfovfHqyZ,2020-01-24 19:01:34,Twitter Web App,340,1093

Oklahomans want to invest in their communities &amp; not spend time wondering whether they are breaking a federal reg &amp; finalizing this rule helps them to do just that.,2020-01-23 23:56:12,Twitter for iPhone,10,43
Federal regs should not be so complicated &amp; unclear that you need a team of attorneys to tell you whether the ditch on your land is federally regulated.,2020-01-23 23:56:12,Twitter for iPhone,11,50
More great news from @RealDonaldTrump &amp; his team as they provide clarity &amp; certainty for farmers ranchers &amp; landowners to know when they need a federal permit to impact water on their land &amp; when they do not. https://t.co/6YGLKKSRZg,2020-01-23 23:56:11,Twitter for iPhone,29,68

47 years ago today our nation was forever changed by a #SupremeCourt decision that elevated privacy over sanctity of human life. While we continue to fight to protect all human life from conception to natural death we should never forget the consequence of that day. #RoevWade,2020-01-22 15:41:05,Twitter Web App,72,278
In 2017 #SupremeCourt affirmed 7-2 in Trinity Lutheran that religious orgs don't have to give up their faith to partner w/ fed gov. Whether it's safe playground equip or scholarship programs-- today's case religious groups should be able to participate w/o discrimination. https://t.co/wQZB0PeqND,2020-01-22 15:39:14,Twitter Web App,19,70
It’s really surreal to hear the House Managers define what a they believe a “fair trial” would be in the Senate after seeing how they conducted the unfair impeachment in the House.,2020-01-21 20:10:58,Twitter for iPhone,6687,17095
We live in the most prosperous nation on earth with millions of great people who love their families and our country. There is much more that unites us than divides us.

In his speech from Montgomery the day before the bus boycott Dr. King said “I want to say that in all of our actions we must stick together.Unity is the great need of the hour &amp; if we are united we can get many of the things that we not only desire but which we justly deserve.”,2020-01-20 15:45:41,Twitter Web App,13,31
