Congress ALREADY voted against unauthorized war with Iran but @POTUS and Sec.

This is beyond dangerous.,2020-11-17 20:04:01,Twitter Web App,15,59

I couldn't be happier about this because for thousands of #DREAMERS in NM and hundreds of thousands more across the nation #HomeIsHere— and it's going to stay that way. https://t.co/I4B0lBBD0r,2020-06-18 14:26:46,Twitter Web App,45,214
I’m thrilled Rechelle Gutierrez of Silver City has a film showing in this event “The Spark of the Civil Rights Movement: Diane Nash.” It’s so important that young people are learning— and teaching us all— about history through creating and sharing art.

Throughout my career I’ve championed increases to the LWCF but it deserves the dedicated funding my father envisioned which we passed today. I'm so proud of this bipartisan effort that is going to serve the American people every day.,2020-06-17 16:30:09,Twitter Web App,7,27
In New Mexico #LWCF has helped support sites like Valles Caldera. Full permanent funding means we can create and maintain places like this across the country introducing people to a world of wonder and helping establish a lifelong connection to nature. https://t.co/ONyFnvPpt2,2020-06-17 16:30:08,Twitter Web App,5,24
These sites are a boost for our economy— especially now. Investing in public lands must be a centerpiece of recovery during these challenging times. And as great as the economic benefits are human benefits to ourselves our families and our communities might be even greater.,2020-06-17 16:30:08,Twitter Web App,3,7
This is personal for me. My father championed the #LWCF Act in 1964.   Ever since it's been wildly popular protecting land in urban &amp; rural areas. It helps build and maintain:   -parks -forests -wildlife refuges -trails -wild &amp; scenic rivers -historic monuments -cultural sites https://t.co/tJ4gjUadMv,2020-06-17 16:30:08,Twitter Web App,3,13
Our country’s public lands are at the very core of our national identity and this is especially true for New Mexicans. #LWCF has funded 42000 projects in the United States and in New Mexico it’s helped support over 1200 such projects found in all 33 counties. https://t.co/3KBkMmdyi3,2020-06-17 16:30:07,Twitter Web App,3,7
A monumental win for conservation: today the Senate passed the Great American Outdoors Act fully and permanently funding the Land and Water Conservation Fund and realizing the true promise of the #LWCF.

The Senate could be working on major issues right now like the Justice in Policing Act COVID response and expanding both voting &amp; health care access.  But what does @senatemajldr focus on?

Nancy Beck is the ultimate example of the fox guarding the henhouse. Tune in at 2:30ET/12:30MT to a @SenateCommerce livestream of her nomination hearing: https://t.co/OkFcuzHJOy,2020-06-16 17:49:00,Twitter Web App,11,30
In her current role at the Trump @EPA Nancy Beck has been more focused on protecting chemical companies than the workers or the public who could be hurt by toxic chemicals. This is dangerous reckless and shows that she is not up to the job of protecting American consumers.,2020-06-16 17:49:00,Twitter Web App,41,128
Yesterday we got word that over 100 National and State organizations have signed a letter to @SenateCommerce expressing their strong opposition to Nancy Beck’s nomination. I couldn’t agree more. https://t.co/Wur4ou4KkE,2020-06-16 17:48:59,Twitter Web App,11,25
I don’t see how our committee—let alone the American people—can trust her to protect consumers when her record has been one of blocking weakening and delaying public health protections proposed by our nation’s most trusted experts. https://t.co/XWgO3HQb0v,2020-06-16 17:48:59,Twitter Web App,11,24
Today former chemical industry lobbyist Nancy Beck will come before @SenateCommerce for a hearing on her nomination to lead the Consumer Product Safety Commission.

We’re urging the #FEC to establish strong clear rules for transparency about who’s behind online political ads.

Nancy Beck should not be in charge of consumer safety.   Because of decisions she has made in her current role at @EPA workers have been exposed to dangerous toxins &amp; the public has been exposed to dangerous products.   She is the wrong person to lead @USCPSC.,2020-06-15 18:32:46,Twitter Web App,24,57
I’ve spoken to and met with so many inspiring DACA recipients from NM. Dreamers have made incredible contributions to our state and the rest of the country. They deserve permanent protection and certainty. #HomeisHere,2020-06-15 18:00:43,Twitter Web App,10,53
Today is the 8th anniversary of #DACA but its future remains uncertain— and thus the future of so many young people across our nation remains uncertain. I encourage everyone eligible to renew their DACA status and I implore @senatemajldr to bring #HR6 to the floor.,2020-06-15 18:00:43,Twitter Web App,25,96

Joe lived a long full life that exemplified service integrity and love. I am honored to pay tribute to Joe Vandever – who faithfully served our nation and his family and Tribe.,2020-06-12 16:56:43,Twitter Web App,8,46
Joe was fiercely proud of the Navajo language. According to him “Our language is powerful” &amp; “we [won] the war with our tongue.” He wanted younger generations to learn the language and told them: ‘Don’t ever leave your language.’,2020-06-12 16:56:43,Twitter Web App,12,49
Joe’s Navajo name means “going places.” He certainly did so during the war &amp; long after. He was stationed on 16 battleships translated messages from Navajo to English honored his Navajo traditions as a medicine man &amp; held many important roles in his community when he returned.,2020-06-12 16:56:42,Twitter Web App,2,7
This week I honored Navajo Code Talker and Marine veteran Joe Vandever Sr. in the Congressional record. Joe passed away at age 96 earlier this year leaving behind a loving family and an incredible legacy.

The science is shocking: plastic pollution is everywhere—even the air we breathe. If we want to clean up our land air and water we have to be bold. We need to pass my #BreakFreeFromPlastic Pollution Act now. https://t.co/PmSR0lPL44,2020-06-12 16:13:48,Twitter Web App,52,155
Nancy Beck President Trump’s nominee to head @USCPSC has time and time again made rules and decisions putting chemical companies' profits over people’s health.  We can't trust her to protect consumer safety when her career has been full of decisions putting consumers in danger.,2020-06-11 21:01:01,Twitter Web App,29,71
We need to #BreakFreeFromPlastic and commit to the #30By30 promise of conserving 30% of land and water by 2030. We must take these kinds of bold steps if we want to create a livable world for future generations.,2020-06-11 20:02:30,Twitter Web App,4,17
It was great to participate in Capitol Hill Oceans Week #CHOW2020. Lots of people ask why a senator from a landlocked state is so passionate about our oceans.

I’m proud to announce $4.5 million in @HUDgov grants for Pueblo of Acoma Pueblo de Cochiti &amp; Ohkay Owingeh.

Throughout the #COVID19 pandemic Tribes have been unable to obtain clear guidance on services available to them for disaster assistance— @FEMA needs to make that guidance available and streamline services to get Native communities the help they need now. https://t.co/X7xc163KBs,2020-06-11 15:42:52,Twitter Web App,37,71
The Trump administration has failed to issue #CARESAct #COVID19 relief funds to Tribal schools.

Long lines and poor planning force people to give up and leave effectively disenfranchising them. In GA many of the polling places with long waits were in predominantly Black communities. We must ensure our elections are free of racial bias. https://t.co/BeK7m2BMKp,2020-06-10 18:48:36,Twitter Web App,6,15
Scenes from last night’s election in Georgia looked nothing like the free &amp; fair elections Americans are entitled to.

This is wrong. https://t.co/ARI5x8KK1Q,2020-06-10 18:48:36,Twitter Web App,19,54
Sec. Mnuchin just told @SenatorCantwell that after multiple missed deadlines the next round of Tribal #COVID19 relief $ will get out the door at the end of this week. Let’s hope it's true.

According to @NMDOH nearly half of those who have tested positive for #COVID19 in NM are Native— a demographic that only makes up 10% of NM's population. These are staggering numbers.

Instead they tried to move forward on inadequate #COVID19 legislation w/o any bipartisan negotiations.,2020-04-09 15:51:06,Twitter Web App,19,46
It would be flat out wrong for any federal agency to take advantage of a pandemic to push through the Trump administration's controversial policy agenda when the public isn't looking. https://t.co/SXfdm7mXiZ,2020-04-09 15:15:52,Twitter Web App,15,31
I led my colleagues in urging the administration to  -indefinitely extend public comment periods -postpone hearings until gatherings are safe -pause new federal rulemaking unrelated to the #COVID19 response.  We must ensure the public can participate in our democratic process. https://t.co/3PL7d1sQIc,2020-04-09 15:15:52,Twitter Web App,42,86
Remember: we can slow the spread of #COVID19. Doctors and nurses need us to #StayHome because doing so can save lives.   If you need any more information look to @NMDOH: https://t.co/YSQVUnxFWy,2020-04-08 21:22:34,Twitter Web App,8,32
I’m calling for support for local news outlets in any future Coronavirus relief packages.  NM outlets have had to lay off journalists and limit operations in the face of falling ad revenue. The free press is essential to democracy— we must protect it in these uncertain times. https://t.co/IBPRleZCMy,2020-04-08 19:44:20,Twitter Web App,64,189

The president continues to remove those who are there to keep him accountable. Now he's sidelining the independent watchdog who is integral to our COVID-19 response. When @POTUS thinks the rules don't apply to him the American people pay the price. https://t.co/ah3b88a1fE,2020-04-07 21:31:19,Twitter Web App,41,113
Our proposal will give Tribes equal access to these benefits. This is vital because this crisis is hitting Indian Country especially hard: frontline workers in Native communities are already stretched thin because of federal underfunding and this crisis is making matters worse.,2020-04-07 19:10:28,Twitter Web App,9,31
Health care workers first responders grocery workers and all others on the #COVID19 front lines deserve more than words of gratitude: we must ensure they're paid what they deserve. We've proposed a "Heroes Fund" to give pandemic premium pay to essential workers.,2020-04-07 19:10:27,Twitter Web App,89,281
The safest thing New Mexicans can do is stay home whenever possible. So we need to make sure they can vote from their own homes. After all the president requested an absentee ballot—if it’s good enough for him it’s good enough for every single American. https://t.co/QKllFt8zpE,2020-04-07 18:06:57,Twitter Web App,14,36
It's simple: people shouldn’t have to risk their lives to exercise the right to vote. We need to make vote by mail available to every eligible voter and provide resources for states to implement early in-person voting. https://t.co/vpmgCZtolM,2020-04-07 18:06:57,Twitter Web App,24,74
Proud to see New Mexico companies putting their resources toward vital equipment that the doctors nurses &amp; health care workers on the front lines of this pandemic need.

Proud to announce over $674000 today in transportation grants to Tribes from the #CARESAct.

This @ABQJournal editorial raises important alarm: just a 1% undercount in the #2020Census could mean New Mexico loses about $1 billion in federal funds over the next 10 years. We simply can't let that happen. #CensusCounts https://t.co/vdsqI8HVOE,2020-04-06 19:27:18,Twitter Web App,16,26
I'll be joining Native America Calling @180099native at 11:00 a.m. MT / 1:00 p.m. ET to discuss the federal response to #COVID19 for Indian Country. Tune in: https://t.co/3zd9Q8stkP,2020-04-06 16:55:32,Twitter Web App,5,24
We wrote to @Interior requesting they focus on #COVID19 response efforts— and pause unrelated policy actions.   Now is not the time to push through new rules when public input will clearly be severely limited. We’re in the midst of a crisis. https://t.co/tzOZtWFsic,2020-04-03 21:48:20,Twitter for iPhone,107,272
My friend @NNPrezNez is right: we cannot abandon Native communities. I fought hard to increase funding for Indian Country in the last #COVID19 relief bill because the Trump admin. and GOP leadership tried to leave them out. But we still need to do more. https://t.co/o3NzvmvUkO,2020-04-03 20:28:05,Twitter Web App,88,276
40 out-of-state construction workers are being sent to tightly packed trailers and at two small hotels in Columbus NM. This is an unnecessary risk that endangers a remote community with limited health care resources. @POTUS must halt construction immediately.,2020-04-03 19:30:25,Twitter Web App,21,43
President Trump is ignoring public health—sending construction workers into small towns to build his wall. We need to do everything we can to contain #COVID19 and putting the health of our rural communities at risk for a political project is outrageous. https://t.co/mSua5DHRzl,2020-04-03 19:30:25,Twitter Web App,45,79
Everyone in NM who can should follow guidance to stay at home. But public transportation remains essential because those who can’t telework— heroic health care workers and essential workers who are still being asked to go to work— need access to safe public transportation.,2020-04-03 19:04:31,Twitter Web App,2,28
NM is getting $133 million in emergency transit grants a first wave of funding from the #CARESAct #COVID19 relief bill. This will be a major help for state &amp; local gov'ts who are being forced to choose between providing basic transportation services &amp; responding to this crisis.,2020-04-03 19:04:31,Twitter Web App,6,48
We are asking @EPAAWheeler how @EPA is adjusting pollution enforcement in light of #COVID19.  We cannot allow EPA’s core functions—which are essential to protecting public health clean air &amp; water—to fall by the wayside while we fight this crisis. The agency must be transparent. https://t.co/a9M1l3AYzj,2020-04-02 19:13:18,Twitter Web App,17,26
IMPORTANT: Social Security recipients do NOT need to take additional action to get cash assistance provided by the #CARESAct.  @IRSnews provided confusing guidance but at our urging they changed course and are going to send these payments automatically as the bill requires. https://t.co/ZNukSd64ac,2020-04-02 17:02:38,Twitter Web App,12,24
We fought hard to get more funding for Indian Country in the #CARESAct but the Trump administration needs to get those resources out the door as soon as possible. Indian Country cannot afford to wait.,2020-04-02 16:17:59,Twitter Web App,14,39

We are in the midst of a pandemic and the president won’t re-open the exchange to help people get health care.  We called for a re-opening because this unprecedented crisis requires simple measures like this to get people the care they need. It’s unconscionable that he won’t. https://t.co/buCfz1ywEv,2020-04-01 21:36:36,Twitter Web App,49,112

Today is #EqualPayDay. The pay gap still has women making ~79 cents for every dollar a man makes and the numbers are worse for women of color.

Everyone in your community should have access to supplies. Donate to your local food bank or shelter and when you grocery shop make sure not to over-buy so everyone gets what they need.  And do as much of your shopping as you can at local businesses which might be struggling.,2020-03-17 21:52:31,Twitter Web App,5,5
Check in with your neighbors by phone email or text. Maintaining community is important even when we're physically distancing. Make sure everyone is taking the necessary precautions and if your neighbors are high-risk you can offer to do some basic tasks for them.,2020-03-17 21:52:30,Twitter Web App,4,4
Donating blood is vital.

Investing in early childhood education is an investment in the future of our children &amp; the future of our state.

The 1872 Mining Law is a sweetheart deal for big mining companies—and most are foreign-owned. They mine for free on your public lands and then you pay the cleanup bill. New Mexicans are fed up.

Two years ago today 17 people died in the Parkland shooting and yet we are still fighting to get Congress out of the gun lobby’s grip.   We have to end this crisis for the sake of our children and their futures. Thoughts and prayers simply are not enough.,2020-02-14 19:47:27,Twitter Web App,37,164

For too long the burden of fixing plastic pollution has been put on everyday people. I say we hold the companies that profit from making all that waste responsible for cleaning it up which is why I introduced a bill to #BreakFreeFromPlastic. https://t.co/3bKQxXPj4C,2020-02-14 15:32:33,Twitter Web App,50,136
Today the Senate stood up for the Constitution and stood with the American people. We passed a bipartisan resolution and sent an important message: Congress has not signed off on war with Iran and neither have the people. We need to act before it’s too late. #NoWarWithIran,2020-02-13 19:08:59,Twitter Web App,32,147
Would you believe that in 2020 women aren’t guaranteed equal rights under the Constitution?   Supporting the Equal Rights Amendment means supporting equality. We can’t wait.

Preserving wild places is good for our future and good for our economy. With the river under threat our legislation would protect the Gila &amp; benefit the economy long-term. Let’s come together to get it done.,2020-02-13 15:51:15,Twitter Web App,6,32

Each of us is swallowing a credit card’s worth of plastic each week. It’s polluting our oceans and communities costing taxpayers billions and worsening climate change.  The time has come to #BreakFreeFromPlastic Pollution. https://t.co/ZJ60ZOqCUA,2020-02-11 19:38:42,Twitter for iPhone,41,128
Our bill is comprehensive because this crisis demands it. And it's achievable because the people are behind us. Congress must take up this legislation now. #BreakFreeFromPlastic https://t.co/yjYT7ME7B9,2020-02-11 18:03:03,Twitter Web App,21,55
How does the bill work? 1. We phase out single-use items that can’t be recycled.    2. We shift responsibility for managing waste to the producers so they'll make more sustainable products.   3. We prioritize communities that bear the worst cost of plastic pollution.,2020-02-11 18:03:02,Twitter Web App,12,43
Not only is it expensive— most of our plastic waste isn't getting recycled anyway. The vast majority ends up in landfills incinerators or in our oceans and gutters. And meanwhile the endless production of plastic is now a leading contributor to greenhouse gas emissions.,2020-02-11 18:03:01,Twitter Web App,4,9
Big corporations are making more and more single-use plastics and unnecessary packaging fooling us into thinking that plastic is convenient widely recyclable and easily and cheaply disposed of. But that's just not true.,2020-02-11 18:03:01,Twitter Web App,4,6

How does plastic pollution hurt us? -It's polluting rivers lakes oceans and landscapes -accelerating climate change -infiltrating our bodies and killing wildlife -breaking local government budgets since they can't afford to recycle anymore.,2020-02-11 18:03:00,Twitter Web App,6,8
Where is plastic pollution? -in our communities -in our air -in our water -in our food -in our bodies  In short: it’s everywhere and it doesn’t biodegrade.,2020-02-11 18:02:59,Twitter Web App,6,7

Today I voted to convict the president on both articles of impeachment: because he abused his office for personal gain and then tried to cover it up.

Every family in NM should be able to afford health insurance. But the #StateOfHealthCare under @POTUS has been non-stop GOP efforts to eliminate protections for people with pre-existing conditions and attacks on Medicare &amp; Medicaid.

The evidence gathered by the House--that the president abused his office and taxpayer funds for personal gain--is staggering.  He got caught red-handed and immediately commenced a scorched-earth blockade to cover up his grave misdeeds.  These facts are indisputable.,2020-02-04 00:48:33,Twitter Web App,66,225
I will vote to convict the president on both articles of impeachment. He is guilty by any standard.   While the Senate may vote to acquit him he will not be exonerated – not by this sham trial.

What’s a trial without witnesses &amp; documents? A sham. It‘s a sad day when senators are helping orchestrate a cover-up on behalf of a president.

On my dad Stewart Udall's 100th birthday we must heed his warnings about the quiet crises facing the earth.  We must write an aggressive playbook to confront the climate &amp; nature crises to save our planet and way of life.  My op-ed in @highcountrynews: https://t.co/y9nk4q50yi,2020-01-31 17:44:32,Twitter Web App,55,141
Before my father passed he and my mother penned a letter to their grandchildren: “Go well do well my children. Cherish sunsets wild creatures and wild places. Have a love affair with the wonder and beauty of the earth.”  With the earth under attack we must heed these words. https://t.co/wBbi2nOCHr,2020-01-31 15:56:13,Twitter Web App,14,82
And as we work to protect the environment we must follow my father's example and protect communities tribes and states that have relied on fossil fuels. Transitioning to a clean energy economy is for everyone and no one can be left behind. https://t.co/Rv9xzxamek,2020-01-31 15:56:10,Twitter Web App,4,47
Today just as we did 50 years ago under my dad's leadership we must rewrite the playbook to face these crises.  That’s why I intro'd the 30 by 30 Resolution to Save Nature. That's why we must face climate change with urgency it requires and make public lands pollution free. https://t.co/KHXaFFO0Ml,2020-01-31 15:56:07,Twitter Web App,5,29
While Pres. Trump has the worst environmental record of any president we cannot stop at simply reversing his attacks.   These crises were worsening before he took office and the trajectory will continue once he leaves. Unless we enact a bold new plan as my father envisioned. https://t.co/3KGQflmv29,2020-01-31 15:56:05,Twitter Web App,7,31

Canyonlands is one of 4 national parks 6 national monuments 9 recreation areas 20 historic sites &amp; 56 wildlife refuges that Stewart Udall helped create.

During his first year as Interior Sec. my dad was flown over Southern Utah for a tour of what was supposed to be the "next big dam."  But my dad took one look at the red rock spires below and saw not a dam—but a national park.  Today that park is Canyonlands National Park. https://t.co/thFJP2Fnp1,2020-01-31 15:55:58,Twitter Web App,6,34

Today my father Stewart Udall would have turned 100 years old.  In his 1963 book The Quiet Crisis he warned about the destruction of nature: “We are all brief tenants on this planet" he said.  These words are an urgent message to us today.  Let me tell you about my dad. https://t.co/PESHUrCOeH,2020-01-31 15:55:54,Twitter Web App,49,237
A trial without witnesses and documents is a cover-up. It’s as simple as that.  The American people are watching and what they want is for Congress to do its job. That means getting the full truth about @POTUS’ abuse of power.,2020-01-31 14:52:38,Twitter Web App,97,286
The two measures the House has passed today represent a long-overdue exercise of congressional war powers.

Let’s be clear: yesterday the president’s lawyer argued that the president should be allowed to solicit foreign interference in our elections. Outrageous. https://t.co/BV5LAUDWMf,2020-01-30 17:39:24,Twitter Web App,58,153
With the president continuing to openly ask for foreign interference I asked House managers to address the argument that impeachment “overturns” an election.  As Rep. Schiff replied: Impeachment “is not voiding the last election it is protecting the next election." https://t.co/owAAYXLWu7,2020-01-29 20:16:27,Twitter Web App,62,187

I talked to @DanaBashCNN this morning about senators’ opportunity to ask questions of the impeachment managers and White House defense team today as well as the vital need for relevant witnesses and documents these proceedings. Watch here: https://t.co/saA6AmGN5o,2020-01-29 17:54:21,Twitter Media Studio,7,20
We need at least four Republican senators to stand up and vote to ensure that relevant witnesses— like John Bolton— and documents are a part of the impeachment trial. Refusing to seek the truth is playing a part in a cover-up not a trial.,2020-01-28 17:15:42,Twitter Web App,61,253
This is a cruel new rule that is going to have a direct threatening impact on the lives of families in New Mexico and across the nation. This goes against everything the United States is supposed to stand for. https://t.co/Qfj3nrmAys,2020-01-27 21:21:11,Twitter Web App,63,157

Today the president's lawyers didn't address the central issue: that @POTUS apparently abused his office to solicit phony investigations to benefit himself politically.   And they didn't answer this: if their defense is so strong why are they blocking witnesses from testifying? https://t.co/UEFgKPUyod,2020-01-25 20:42:53,Twitter Web App,138,425
The House impeachment managers have laid out a grave and deeply compelling case.   If President Trump has a real defense then we need to see documents and hear from witnesses. And @POTUS’ lawyers are going to have to respond to facts—not offer debunked conspiracy theories.,2020-01-25 02:34:00,Twitter for iPhone,157,525
I’ve asked @TheJusticeDept several times to answer if Mr. Giuliani the president’s personal attorney is in compliance with the Foreign Agents Registration Act. The public—and Senate—need to know who he is really working for.,2020-01-24 18:01:59,Twitter Web App,67,137
This is the right question. Why is @POTUS trusting Rudy Giuliani— who makes millions from undisclosed foreign clients— over distinguished public officials? It’s dangerous. https://t.co/FHrAR1qfg2,2020-01-24 18:01:59,Twitter Web App,291,861
When @POTUS and his team threaten senators and tell them who they can't call as witnesses that's jury intimidation.   When GOP senators refuse to allow relevant witnesses to speak that's a cover-up.  The American people are demanding a fair trial. https://t.co/IyUXOFGMZe,2020-01-24 15:41:52,Twitter Web App,110,259

The House managers are presenting a disturbing case about President Trump's solicitation of foreign interference.    To get the full truth we need relevant witnesses and documents.

The #RoevWade decision came down 47 years ago today protecting a woman’s constitutional right to make her own reproductive health care decisions.  We must fend off attacks on reproductive care attacks that especially target marginalized communities.,2020-01-22 22:16:18,Twitter Web App,30,119
Last night @senategop voted to block EIGHT amendments that would have allowed witnesses &amp; documents into the impeachment trial.   If you don’t want evidence in the record then we have to assume there’s something in that evidence you want to hide. That’s a cover-up not a trial.,2020-01-22 17:46:31,Twitter Web App,110,288
Fair trials have evidence and witnesses. But every member of @senategop just voted to BLOCK the Senate from obtaining key White House and State Dept documents in President Trump’s trial. They’re bringing us closer to a full and blatant cover-up. https://t.co/TWJTG3pBCP,2020-01-22 00:37:45,Twitter for iPhone,201,476
10 years ago the #CitizensUnited decision flung open the door for the wealthy &amp; powerful to take over our democratic system. But democracy isn’t just for the few. So we need to pass my #DemocracyForAll amendment to overturn Citizens United &amp; put gov’t back in the people’s hands. https://t.co/d55gmNhwpn,2020-01-21 20:43:33,Twitter Web App,34,74
Ten years of #CitizensUnited have been disastrous for our political system. We must pass our #DemocracyForAll amendment to overturn #CitizensUnited.

The American people deserve a full and fair trial. Unfortunately it seems that @senategop leaders are trying to guarantee the results they want from the start.   Now the question is: will Senate Republicans go along with a cover-up or will they stand up for a full &amp; fair trial?,2020-01-21 18:15:04,Twitter Web App,24,78
The resolution allows for a dismissal vote at ANY TIME. Even if arguments haven’t been heard yet unlike the Clinton trial. Early dismissal would violate our oath and constitutional duty.,2020-01-21 18:15:04,Twitter Web App,10,54
