The choice could not be more clear. A vote for Trump is a vote to continue his disrespect and disregard for Native Americans. A vote for @JoeBiden is a vote to empower tribes to exercise their inherent rights &amp; create prosperity.

Another debate another clear contrast between a real leader like @JoeBiden and someone who is totally unfit for office—@realDonaldTrump.

Let’s be honest about what we saw tonight: a president who refused to condemn white supremacists who denied climate change and who embarrassed the country with his attempts to undermine our elections.   But we also saw @JoeBiden show us what real leadership looks like.,2020-09-30 04:00:12,Twitter for iPhone,5,16

Thank you @JoeBiden. The Grand Canyon is irreplaceable—sacred to Tribes &amp; treasured by all Americans.  It’s outrageous that Donald Trump wants to let uranium mining corps near the Grand Canyon.
