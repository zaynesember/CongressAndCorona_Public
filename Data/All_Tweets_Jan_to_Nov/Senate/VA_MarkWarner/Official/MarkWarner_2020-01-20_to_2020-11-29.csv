In the midst of a national emergency it is unconscionable that the President is once again attempting to undermine the integrity of the intelligence community by firing yet another intelligence official the ICIG simply for doing his job.,2020-04-04 02:57:24,TweetDeck,3891,12632
The #PPPLoan is a lifeline for small businesses…but only if it works. Seeing concerning reports of technical problems with @SBAGov’s E-Tran site preventing loans from getting out to small businesses.

From what I can see Capt. Crozier is a patriot who was just trying to do what’s best for his crew. If this report is accurate I don’t know why he would be punished for that -- especially with so many lives at stake. https://t.co/BfnegDNeqt,2020-04-02 21:27:00,TweetDeck,2734,8505
I’m concerned about the safety of Virginians serving aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt who’ve been exposed to coronavirus but frankly this could happen aboard any Navy ship.   @TimKaine and I just sent a letter to @SECNAV calling on the Navy to do more to protect our sailors. https://t.co/TBobPghvVr,2020-04-01 18:48:35,Twitter Web App,100,358

A few weeks ago I’m willing to bet 0/100 Senators had ever used @zoom_us.   Now here I am talking to 100+ business owners with @NOVAChamber about how we keep businesses open and workers on the payroll. https://t.co/BIAM3fB9r7,2020-03-31 16:25:45,Twitter for iPhone,47,318
I also talked with the mayors about how we can make sure funds from the “Phase III” coronavirus bill move quickly to the local communities who need it. We need to do the same for the funding for small and mid-sized businesses.,2020-03-30 21:29:51,Twitter Web App,45,187
Just got off a call with mayors from across Virginia and I’m hearing a lot of concern for first responders who do not have adequate PPE.

These kinds of COVID-19-targeted cyber threats are beginning to emerge and we need to get ahead of them.

If we’re going to do coronavirus tax relief it can’t just be about shoring up companies’ bottom line. We’ve got to help workers who’ve been furloughed lost their jobs or had their hours cut.
