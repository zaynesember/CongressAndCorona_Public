In 2018 Ronna McDaniel’s @GOP helped me flip Indiana’s Senate seat from blue to red and has helped elect countless pro-Trump Republicans. I am proud to endorse @GOPChairwoman. https://t.co/FXoK3R7QY2,2020-11-18 17:25:13,Twitter for iPhone,34,191
"We have armed security" Indy10 BLM admits they were blocking traffic and threatening peaceful citizens.   When will Dem Mayors restore law &amp; order to our great cities?   BLM groups have been radicalized!   Extremism &amp; violence should be condemned!  https://t.co/qip4rsK8Ct,2020-08-12 12:55:20,Twitter Web App,15,25
“The chief’s decision comes amid the city’s plan to reduce the department by as many as 100 officers.” The radical left has no respect for law enforcement and this happening all over America if they take control of Washington this November! Back the Badge! https://t.co/YTD3wRLCa9,2020-08-12 12:17:00,Twitter Web App,6,17
Biden needs to come out of his basement to debate @realDonaldTrump and do it before Americans start voting! Why not in Indiana? I am calling on the Debate Commission to add an earlier debate. Hoosiers voting early deserve to hear from the candidates before casting their ballots. https://t.co/YZ7gyZyEH6,2020-08-07 17:14:43,Twitter Web App,553,1802
I campaigned with President Trump in 2018 – where he helped expand our Senate majority – and touted his policies to Make America Great Again. I‘ll be at the @GOPconvention in Jacksonville with @realDonaldTrump where we will kick off the 2020 campaign to #KeepAmericaGreat! https://t.co/ZEoBcoOSiI,2020-07-07 17:58:11,Twitter for iPhone,166,645
Thank you President @realDonaldTrump: “Mike Braun you have done some great job. Thank you very much. Tough!” https://t.co/IE6LGwKVxu,2020-02-06 17:51:30,Twitter for iPhone,52,219
The @realDonaldTrump agenda is working and resonating across the country. When you look at the crazy talk on the other side from Bernie or Joe Biden you know it‘s going to be an easy argument for our President to make. He’s doing a great job. https://t.co/oQOsVBuOsc,2020-01-30 16:00:13,Twitter for iPhone,9,49
