In March the COVID Task Force predicted 100000 to 240000 Americans would lose their lives even with strong mitigation. Dr. Birx in March: “If we do things together well almost perfectly we could get into the range of 100000 to 200000 fatalities.” https://t.co/TlQBjgE6QS,2020-09-16 19:53:48,Twitter Web App,7,6
Due in large part to actions taken by President @realDonaldTrump the U.S. has weathered this pandemic better than many other countries.   The U.S. ranks 8th in COVID-19 deaths per capita — lower than the UK Belgium Peru Spain Italy Sweden &amp; Chile. https://t.co/TlQBjgE6QS,2020-09-16 19:27:57,Twitter Web App,198,350
For the past 6 months Americans have been subjected to an unprecedented effort by the media and Democrats in Congress to rewrite the history of the COVID pandemic. It has real consequences for our ability to fight the virus and reopen smartly and safely. https://t.co/TlQBjgE6QS,2020-09-16 19:23:05,Twitter Web App,18,27
We can reopen our country safely and I’m glad to hear the Big Ten Conference is coming back with the necessary safety precautions.   Hoosiers are ready for #BigTen football this fall. https://t.co/kNRTJkw696,2020-09-16 14:00:44,Twitter for iPhone,9,31
Cop killers should be prepared to get the death penalty.   I was proud to support @SenToomey's #ThinBlueLineAct to make it easier to give criminals who target police the death penalty when it was introduced last year and I'm proud to support it today.  https://t.co/uwZiHUMhPH,2020-09-15 21:17:36,Twitter Web App,13,31
Anyone who kills a police officer should pay the highest price possible.  I was a proud supporter @SenToomey's #ThinBlueLineAct last year which would make killing or attempting to kill police an aggravating factor in favor of the death penalty.   Today Democrats blocked it.,2020-09-15 21:12:15,Twitter Web App,96,197
We can’t pay more in unemployment than folks made at their job. I support a temporary boost in unemployment benefits that fixes this issue without adding trillions in debt or funding D.C. pet projects. https://t.co/r9y7vEtTVk,2020-09-15 18:38:03,Twitter Web App,25,68

We must do everything we can to fight #COVIDー19; now we're in a race between flattening the curve but not flattening the economy.

I’m one of the most fiscally conservative Senators - this is urgent.

We all agree we need to help workers and small businesses that don’t have the resources that a large business has to get through this now.

My question w/ @SenRickScott: If Speaker Pelosi Chairman Schiff &amp; House Democrats were so confident in the gravity of the President’s conduct why were House Republicans denied the procedural accommodations &amp; substantive rights afforded to Democrats during the Clinton process?,2020-01-30 19:56:58,Twitter Web App,27,95
It's a big deal. It will hype up the growth and GDP over so many jobs created. It's just good across the board and we need to get back to that as well as tackling health care and other issues. https://t.co/xwTlhVDPtq,2020-01-30 15:42:07,Twitter Web App,16,55
Indiana is the number 1 state per capita in manufacturing with Ag being right there in second. For my state and for the country #USMCA is a winner and it's going to build on the agenda @realDonaldTrump is working for.

"In an era of gridlock and partisanship the group creates a bridge between Democrats and Republicans to discuss a variety of potential solutions to one of the most pressing issues of our age." @JGfortwayne  https://t.co/f6qokhK3Uy,2020-01-30 15:04:57,Twitter Web App,11,22
The whistleblower and its origination and the cabal of individuals involved with it should be up for discussion when you're trying to remove a President. https://t.co/C3x5HskrId,2020-01-30 15:04:16,Twitter Web App,89,253
When I ran for Senate it was because I wanted to come here and really do what I think President Trump embodies and that's being not happy with business as usual.

The pen I got from @realDonaldTrump at the #USMCA signing ceremony was one that was actually worth keeping unlike the ones Speaker Pelosi handed out at impeachment. https://t.co/zpmdA7wV2m,2020-01-30 13:39:04,Twitter Web App,74,256
As we've gone on with the trial the talk they dislike the most is what comes from Professor @AlanDersh. The prosecution always gets more defensive when he's coming at the Articles as being ill-founded. https://t.co/wbu6iv5Rsx,2020-01-30 13:36:01,Twitter Web App,21,68

Do both parties agree that the Senate has included in evidence in this trial the testimony of every single witness from which the House heard before they voted except for the Intelligence Community Inspector General report that Chairman Schiff kept secret?

My question with @SenToddYoung: We were promised by House Managers that the evidence supporting each article of impeachment would be “overwhelming” and “uncontested.” Virtually every day House Managers have insisted that the Senate cannot have a trial without witnesses...

From @marcorubio @SenSasse @SenatorRisch @SenMcSallyAZ @SenPatRoberts @SenJohnHoeven &amp; me: How would the Framers view removing a president w/o an overwhelming consensus of the American people on articles of impeachment supported by one political party &amp; opposed by the other?,2020-01-30 03:09:57,Twitter for iPhone,168,494
This is a political trial and we heard from 17 witnesses in the House. Will the 18th give you that marginal information that you need? Or do you look at the constitutional underpinnings that make the case weak?  https://t.co/eGVcoMBVEY,2020-01-29 21:54:28,Twitter Web App,31,140

We are soon coming to the biggest binary decision we'll make in the whole process: convict or acquit.  Even if you take everything in the Bolton revelation as truth would that make the difference and take you over the hump to where you'd convict a President on such a shaky case? https://t.co/57n4uvA9PB,2020-01-28 20:38:24,Twitter Web App,49,185
When impeachment came over in a purely partisan way when they were talking about impeaching him before they knew what it would be for when we're talking about upending an election and preventing another one: those big picture issues are important to someone like me. @NBCNews https://t.co/DOlWvUhlff,2020-01-28 20:05:39,Twitter Web App,52,148

It was priceless tonight to see @AlanDersh turn to the House Managers look right at Schiff and say “You picked the wrong articles these vague charges are unconstitutional.”  I think a lot of fence straddlers had their minds changed tonight. @IngrahamAngle https://t.co/YUpVt6LYE2,2020-01-28 04:26:06,Twitter for iPhone,472,1175
The defense's last hour has been the most powerful presentation on either side in this trial.

Adam Schiff has been involved with this since the Mueller Report fell flat and today he was caught in 2 contradictions: his involvement with the Whistleblower and his false claims of "ample evidence of collusion" between @realDonaldTrump and Russia.  His credibility is tanking. https://t.co/vZrbRYo150,2020-01-25 18:25:41,Twitter Web App,11574,36810
They're trying to build a circumstantial case for quid pro quo when there wasn't an actual quid pro quo. That's going to be a tough sell. Most folks from where I'm from are suspicious of the origin in the first place. https://t.co/1Q1aScza4p,2020-01-24 22:21:26,Twitter Web App,28,106

The Clinton trial had video testimony from 3 witnesses. The Trump trial has had video testimony from 11 witnesses.   The Clinton trial managers took 12 hours to make their case. The Trump trial managers have double that. https://t.co/e9IcVjcw1z,2020-01-24 20:56:33,Twitter Web App,13,60
In 2 days we've already heard video testimony from more witnesses in the Trump trial (11) than they did in the Clinton trial (3).  Democrats' calls for witnesses are disingenuous because they've already categorically dismissed the witnesses we want. @CNN @jaketapper @wolfblitzer https://t.co/hQU1UVfb1W,2020-01-24 16:58:11,Twitter Web App,32,87

I got some advice from someone in my hometown: "Don't forget what we see which is just another partisan effort to take out @realDonaldTrump and delegitimize 2016."  That's what will drive the public.

How this case boils down to me: Was there a quid pro quo?  🔹Ukraine aid was released 🔹Investigation didn't happen 🔹Meeting was held at the UN 🔹Ukrainian President said he felt no pressure  Does this warrant a political death sentence? I don't think that case has been made. https://t.co/cTcBHp8gTT,2020-01-24 00:41:47,Twitter Media Studio,444,1176

REPORTER: So you're saying that it's okay for a President to ask a foreign leader to investigate a political rival and withhold foreign aid to coerce him into doing so?  BRAUN: No I'm not saying that's okay. I'm not saying that's appropriate. I'm saying that it DIDN'T HAPPEN. https://t.co/nARMXL1KEz,2020-01-23 01:14:25,Twitter Web App,13232,36931
Wednesday the day after the beginning of the Senate’s impeachment trial of President Donald Trump Sen.

"I didn't realize the vitriol we've got in this country. Now being here a year I wonder how we're gonna get through it" said Braun.

What we saw yesterday was a lot of visual aids and regurgitation of information we’d already heard. A lot of times when your case is weak you try to repeat it over and over and wear your opposition out.   My full statement today on day one of the impeachment trial: https://t.co/KGwaDU533C,2020-01-22 18:37:11,Twitter Media Studio,196,495
"So you're saying that it's okay for a President to ask a foreign leader to investigate a political rival and withhold foreign aid to coerce him into doing so?"

"I don’t think it’s about impeachment anymore because they know where the case is and that they’re going to lose. They’re now playing to the elections especially the Senate to try to use this and clips from it to weigh in on 4 or 5 races. I think that’s clear." on @hughhewitt,2020-01-22 14:00:14,Twitter Web App,34,98
"If you want a recent reference look at the Kavanaugh hearings. When they knew that their case wasn’t going to make it they turned to delay and to try to win it through some type of manipulation of the public’s perception. People can smell that." on @hughhewitt,2020-01-22 13:50:24,Twitter Web App,95,203
From what I heard today it remains clear House Democrats have failed to prove @realDonaldTrump broke any laws or took any actions that warrant his removal from office.  Schiff &amp; Schumer want a never-ending trial as the next chapter in their failed 3-year effort to get rid of him.,2020-01-22 01:39:34,Twitter Web App,183,432
Today was a bad day for Adam Schiff and Chuck Schumer.   For the first time in this impeachment process the U.S. Senate established a structure that is fair based on precedent and gives President @realDonaldTrump a chance to make his case in front of the American people.,2020-01-22 01:39:34,Twitter Web App,478,1752
