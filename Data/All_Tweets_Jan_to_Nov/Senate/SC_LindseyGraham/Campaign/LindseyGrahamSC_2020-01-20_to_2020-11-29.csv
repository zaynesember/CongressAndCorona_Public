These comments by Mr. Strzok remind us why we should be very cautious and skeptical of any reporting by the @nytimes regarding the Trump presidency. https://t.co/PFit85BQ6k,2020-07-17 22:10:12,Twitter for iPhone,955,2178
These documents which I have long sought tell a damning story for anyone who’s interested in trying to find the truth behind the corrupt nature of the FBI’s investigation into the Trump campaign in 2016 and beyond.,2020-07-17 19:08:56,TweetDeck,570,1765
Moreover the statements by Strzok raise troubling questions as to whether the FBI was impermissibly unmasking and analyzing intelligence gathered on U.S. persons.,2020-07-17 19:08:24,TweetDeck,388,1433
The statements by Mr. Strzok question the entire premise of the FBI’s investigation of the Trump Campaign and make it even more outrageous that the Mueller team continued this investigation for almost two and a half years.,2020-07-17 19:08:05,TweetDeck,541,1357
Secondly the comments of Peter Strzok regarding the February 14 New York Times article are devastating in that they are an admission that there was no reliable evidence that anyone from the Trump Campaign was working with Russian Intelligence Agencies in any form.,2020-07-17 19:07:28,TweetDeck,460,1127
Those who knew or should have known of this development and continued to pursue a FISA warrant against Mr. Page anyway are in deep legal jeopardy in my view.,2020-07-17 19:06:53,TweetDeck,318,884
The dossier was a critical document to justify a FISA warrant against Mr. Page and this DOJ memo clearly indicates that the reliability of the dossier was completely destroyed after the interview with the primary sub-source in January 2017.,2020-07-17 19:06:31,TweetDeck,360,925
Most importantly after this interview of the sub-source and the subsequent memo detailing the contents of the interview it was a miscarriage of justice for the FBI and the Department of Justice to continue to seek a FISA warrant against Carter Page in April and June of 2017.,2020-07-17 19:05:50,TweetDeck,266,724
It is clear to me that the memo regarding the FBI interview of the primary sub-source in January 2017 should have required the system to stop and reevaluate the case against Mr. Page.   https://t.co/Hw50MzLnMV,2020-07-17 19:05:03,TweetDeck,1537,3912

I expect in the coming weeks to give those who occupied the 7th Floor offices an opportunity to explain their behavior.  Let the chips fall where they may.,2020-05-01 14:43:32,Twitter for iPhone,1047,4835
Apparently it was Peter Strzok who intervened suggesting the 7th Floor (FBI leadership) was interested in keeping the case open.,2020-05-01 14:43:31,Twitter for iPhone,685,3186
It appears from released documents the Washington field office — made up of traditional FBI agents — believed there was no “there” there when it came to General Flynn.  https://t.co/B8O4VLkTMO,2020-05-01 14:43:31,Twitter for iPhone,2852,8240
America shouldn't ever have to rely on Communist China -- or anyone else -- for our basic healthcare needs.

If you pay people $23 an hour not to work they will take you up on it.  It doesn’t mean they’re lazy.   It means if you offer them $23 an hour not to work they’ll probably take that over $17 to go to work.  https://t.co/t59FkfPvvm,2020-04-30 12:45:32,TweetDeck,1784,7498
Attorney General Barr needs to be complimented.  He’s doing the right thing.    AG Barr has three goals I share:  * Restore trust.  * Hold people accountable who have engaged in misconduct.  *Right wrongs like General Flynn and I believe eventually George Papadopolous.,2020-04-30 01:47:33,TweetDeck,1839,7280
It’s pretty apparent to me that General Flynn was a victim of an out of control Department of Justice.    He basically got railroaded.    It’s pretty widely known the Obama Administration did not have much use for General Flynn.  https://t.co/LyVvcUPB6A,2020-04-30 01:44:43,TweetDeck,5205,16485

📌 ICYMI 📌  ➡️ 26 million Americans are out of work because of this virus.   ➡️ Almost 56000 Americans are dead because of this virus.   A combination of gross negligence plus willful deception by the Chinese government led to this.  https://t.co/aBp9G9bG4C,2020-04-28 14:23:48,TweetDeck,443,1947

However today was yet another reminder – I dare say ‘Wake Up Call’ - about how dependent we have become on China for our medical supply chain.

The bottom line is without Joe Biden there would be no ISIS.   Without Donald Trump the ISIS caliphate would still exist.

We are fifty individual states but when it comes to the virus we are all in this fight together.    Because of the sacrifices we have made as a nation there is light at the end of the tunnel.  Better days are ahead.,2020-04-22 23:12:04,Twitter for iPhone,79,696
I am confident that in the coming weeks – if we follow the guidelines – more and more businesses will be safely reopened.    Our goal is to achieve a bump in the economy without creating a spike in the virus.,2020-04-22 23:12:04,Twitter for iPhone,76,709
The best way forward is to follow the guidelines set by President Trump and his team.   Barber shops hair salons tattoo parlors and other close quarter business activity will come after a successful Phase I.,2020-04-22 23:12:04,Twitter for iPhone,15,77
I totally understand Governor Kemp’s desire to allow businesses to reopen as small business owners are under great stress.  President Trump and his team have given us a sound roadmap on how to safely reopen the economy.  I strongly suggest as a nation we follow it.,2020-04-22 23:12:04,Twitter for iPhone,26,180
I agree with President @realDonaldTrump’s concern about Georgia going ‘too far too fast’ with business re-openings.    I have great respect for Governor Kemp and believe that future re-openings can occur rather quickly but we must get Phase I right. https://t.co/iKmTeZEW8J,2020-04-22 23:12:04,Twitter for iPhone,277,1365

Until WHO changes its behavior and leadership I think it’s in America’s best interest to withhold funding. They’ve been deceptive they’ve been slow they’ve been Chinese apologists — and they've failed miserably when it comes to #COVID19. https://t.co/8Ifb6ohOVF,2020-04-15 18:19:52,Twitter Web App,2068,8597
I have great respect for  @BillGates and his work in the public health arena.   If someone like Bill Gates were in charge of the WHO I would gladly support increased funding but I have lost all confidence in the current WHO leadership and capabilities.,2020-04-15 14:32:30,TweetDeck,904,3621
The current WHO leadership has proven to be incompetent and shown overwhelming evidence of China bias.    Cutting off funding to the WHO at this time is the right move.  https://t.co/DYv3QaSv20,2020-04-15 14:29:18,TweetDeck,3769,13080

Some on the right claim President Trump overreacted.    Some on the left say he was slow to react.    Based on my view he made the right decision based on the circumstances.  President Trump acted responsibly.,2020-04-13 19:44:07,Twitter Web App,820,4626
➡️Also remember Democrats were pushing hard to extend impeachment in early February by calling additional witnesses to the Senate trial.   Clearly Democrats were not concerned about #COVID19 hurting the country when they were pushing an extension the Senate impeachment trial.,2020-04-13 19:44:06,Twitter Web App,794,3720

@BernieSanders policies now OVERSHADOW the party of @BillClinton and @BarackObama.   A weakened @JoeBiden who enjoys very little enthusiasm for his candidacy will DARE NOT cross the Bernie movement on policy.    That is good news for President @realDonaldTrump!,2020-04-08 17:12:34,Twitter for iPhone,242,1265
Bernie Sanders’ honesty about being a socialist may have cost him the Democratic nomination yet again.    However he should feel some satisfaction in the fact that HIS POLICIES have won the day in the Democratic Party.,2020-04-08 17:12:34,Twitter for iPhone,434,2377
@BernieSanders However while I firmly believe the socialist agenda pushed by Senator Sanders is out of the mainstream of America in many ways his agenda will be the on ballot in 2020.   (2/2),2020-04-08 16:17:18,TweetDeck,130,1091

This has been a partisan impeachment from Day 1 – terrible on process and dangerous on substance.    It rings hollow for Adam Schiff to talk about wanting a fair process.   Finally the sooner this trial is over the better for the American people.,2020-01-31 23:07:45,Twitter for iPhone,6113,25133
The fact is the House chose not to call witnesses like John Bolton because they wanted to impeach President Trump before the election.    It has nothing to do with finding the truth.,2020-01-31 23:07:45,Twitter for iPhone,6530,27483
Their testimony would not change the fact that this is a non-impeachable offense and not the kind of event the Founding Fathers had in mind when it comes to removing a president and preventing them from running for reelection.,2020-01-31 23:07:45,Twitter for iPhone,1178,4971
I’m very pleased the Senate has rejected Democrats’ request to call additional witnesses after the House chose not to.    As I have stated this is not an impeachable offense and the witnesses sought by the House managers were available to them in the House.,2020-01-31 23:07:45,Twitter for iPhone,15205,72574

FACT:   It was the House of Representatives who refused to pursue the testimony of the witnesses because they wanted to impeach the President before Christmas.    Only in Washington would someone call that decision “Blocking Witnesses.”,2020-01-30 17:17:55,Twitter for iPhone,2341,8830
Of all the insane things being said about this impeachment debacle - and there is a lot to choose from - one of the most ridiculous is to say Senate Republicans are “Blocking Witnesses.”   This is an outrageous claim.,2020-01-30 17:17:55,Twitter for iPhone,7473,31387
The best way to sum up this whole debacle is to understand that Senator Schumer’s desire for Lev Parnas to attend the Senate trial apparently cannot be accommodated because Mr. Parnas has an electronic ankle bracelet imposed upon him by the court.

However I am concerned when John Bolton’s credibility is attacked it makes it more likely some will feel the need to call him as a witness.    In that event it would be important for the President and his team to call witnesses on other issues.,2020-01-29 16:47:01,Twitter for iPhone,476,2739

It is clear to me that there is ample evidence for the President to be concerned about conflicts of interest on behalf of Hunter Biden and that Vice President Joe Biden’s failure to take appropriate action was unacceptable.,2020-01-29 16:47:00,Twitter for iPhone,420,2127
For the sake of argument one could assume everything attributable to John Bolton is accurate and still the House case would fall well below the standards to remove a president from office.,2020-01-29 16:47:00,Twitter for iPhone,475,2450
