The hypocrisy of the House managers lecturing us on fairness &amp; due process is outrageous. This is clearly an illegitimate process.  Watch my full impeachment trial update on @FoxNews here. https://t.co/bBthV3UPLp,2020-01-22 23:32:00,Twitter Media Studio,26,35
Last week was historic: We passed #USMCA &amp; signed a Phase One deal with China. Yet all the DC bubble can talk about is an illegitimate impeachment. Discussed this with @hughhewitt this morning. Listen to the full interview here. https://t.co/Rhtz3Ka8CJ,2020-01-22 01:57:54,Twitter Web App,11,13
For radical Democrats this illegitimate impeachment process is not about the truth. It’s about undoing the 2016 election impacting the 2020 presidential election and retaking the U.S. Senate majority. https://t.co/b3sy1rHXIV,2020-01-21 17:42:40,Twitter Media Studio,13,21

Dr. King was a patriot who changed the direction of not just our country but the entire world. His words echo throughout history &amp; remain an inspiration to us all. #MLKDay https://t.co/gHWlXX7l98,2020-01-20 13:45:54,Twitter Web App,5,23
It’s unfortunate that last week’s successes – a Phase One deal w/ China &amp; #USMCA passing the Senate – are overshadowed in the media by an impeachment that’s looking for reasons.,2020-01-20 01:00:00,TweetDeck,13,31
