Inviting new witnesses will not change the outcome of this trial whatsoever.   It’s not the Senate’s job to clean up the illegitimate case presented by House Democrats.,2020-01-31 23:59:15,Twitter for iPhone,352,1757

The Founders were crystal clear: the Senate is charged to rule on articles of impeachment not to continue the House’s investigations.,2020-01-31 23:21:03,Twitter for iPhone,96,461
House managers claimed to have "overwhelming" evidence to convict the president. They did not.  Now they want to redo their investigation in the Senate.  The American people are over this nonsense. It's time to move on. https://t.co/XthPl3Ci26,2020-01-31 17:47:36,Twitter Media Studio,374,1363

#ImpeachmentTrial questions from @SenTedCruz and myself:   Why do House managers refuse to tell the Senate whether or not the so-called whistleblower had a conflict of interest?   Why do House managers refuse to transmit the Inspector General transcript to the Senate?,2020-01-30 00:25:53,Twitter for iPhone,66,238

On #HolocaustRemembranceDay we pause to remember six million Jews whose lives were senselessly taken during the Holocaust. As a society we must continue to root out anti-Semitism wherever it’s found. #WeRemember https://t.co/gSxftSVY4l,2020-01-27 20:05:12,Twitter for iPhone,17,59
For Democrats this impeachment process has never been about finding the truth or protecting the Republic.   This is all about overturning the 2016 election impacting the 2020 election and gaining the U.S. Senate majority.,2020-01-27 19:58:40,Twitter for iPhone,7634,25102

Last week was historic. We passed #USMCA on the floor of the Senate and President Trump signed a new trade deal with China. Yet all the Washington bubble cares about is impeachment. https://t.co/RM5bsLbSeI,2020-01-21 17:13:36,Twitter Media Studio,50,226
