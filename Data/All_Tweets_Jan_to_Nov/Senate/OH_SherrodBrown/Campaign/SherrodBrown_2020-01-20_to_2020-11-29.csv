Trump’s attack on Goodyear is an attack on 64000 Goodyear employees.  Trump has shown his complete disregard for workers time and again. Together we can make him pay for his broken promises and phony populism on Election Day.  https://t.co/B4CWjfk1kQ,2020-08-19 22:49:14,Twitter Web App,138,377

That's the plan -- but we all have to do our part between now and November 3rd. Our support could make the difference between a win and a loss in Minnesota Ohio and all over the country. - SB https://t.co/eL3zeJ7PAh,2020-08-18 14:18:06,Twitter Web App,33,178
More lies from President Trump to distract from his coronavirus failures. Trump has caved to China over and over -- his deal did nothing for Ohio steel factories and did nothing to stop corporations from sending our jobs to China. - SB https://t.co/G88thfgeEv,2020-08-17 20:29:56,Twitter Web App,374,862

In the words of people in Dayton: “Do something.” https://t.co/RPjZnuMgLL,2020-08-04 21:06:57,Twitter Web App,16,76
One year later and they haven't done anything. People do not have to keep dying and we have the power to do something about it. But that can’t happen until politicians stop working for the NRA and start doing the right thing for the people they serve.,2020-08-04 21:06:57,Twitter Web App,13,76

Make no mistake Ohio IS a battleground. We have three months to replace Trump and we’re not taking anything for granted.

"Trump has not offered anything close to the credible inspiring leadership this country so desperately needs to emerge successfully from the depths of our disease-wracked world. Nor is there any hope he could ever be that leader." https://t.co/BIrWdBKJDp,2020-04-18 22:16:57,Twitter Web App,49,176
We fight his phony populism with real populism that fights for all people. That’s what the whole dignity-of-work message is about. That’s where Trump has just missed it. It may have paid off for him in ’16 but it’s not going to pay off for him again. - SB,2020-04-10 14:10:30,Twitter Web App,23,145
He uses racism &amp; bigotry to divide people to distract from the fact that he’s used the White House to enrich himself and his family. Populism’s never racist. It doesn’t push some people down to lift others up. - SB,2020-04-10 14:10:29,Twitter Web App,24,134
First of all he lied to people about protecting #SocialSecurity &amp; #Medicare. He sold people a phony populism to make them feel like he was on their side &amp; then he betrayed them. - SB,2020-04-10 14:10:29,Twitter Web App,13,72

Trump's characterization of himself as a fighter for working families is laughable. That’s why he attacks those of us who strive to govern in that mold.
