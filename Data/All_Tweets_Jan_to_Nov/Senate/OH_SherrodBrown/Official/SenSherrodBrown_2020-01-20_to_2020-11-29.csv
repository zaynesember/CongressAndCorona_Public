Let’s be clear about what the president’s failure means:   No more stimulus checks. No help to pay the rent and bills. No support for our schools.   All so he can rush through his illegitimate Supreme Court nomination. https://t.co/AawbLK92sc,2020-10-06 20:04:24,Twitter Web App,2367,5687
Amazon knows that the biggest threat to its "profit-at-all-costs" culture is workers who can stand up for themselves in the workplace.  That's why they'll stop at nothing to crush unions - including running a secret anti-union surveillance program. https://t.co/dZ7bt8FvVS,2020-10-06 17:47:52,Twitter Web App,125,327
During COVID-19 teachers have stepped up to meet the unprecedented challenges that come with teaching remotely and in-person.   But they need more than thank-yous - they need protections on the job and a real plan from this Administration.  #WorldTeachersDay,2020-10-05 22:03:59,Twitter for iPhone,130,686
Secretary of State @FrankLaRose this is so disingenuous.  You're "allowing multiple ballot drop boxes" where they ALREADY EXISTED.  That does absolutely nothing to make it easier for Ohioans to drop off their ballots in each county. https://t.co/bUgcTpIlkt,2020-10-05 20:22:08,Twitter Web App,354,955
Tell that to the families of the 200000+ Americans who have died from COVID-19.  Tell that to the essential workers risking their lives every day.   And you're STILL in court right now fighting to take away healthcare from millions of Americans.,2020-10-05 19:26:01,Twitter Web App,304,1393
"Don't be afraid of COVID-19"?   @realDonaldTrump tell that to all the Americans who - unlike you - DON'T have access to the best healthcare in the world funded entirely by taxpayers. https://t.co/izBd0xbV8L,2020-10-05 19:22:28,Twitter Web App,1362,5065
It's not just healthcare - marriage equality and civil rights are #WhatsAtStake with the future of the Supreme Court.

Predatory lenders should not be able to charge out-of-control interest fees that lure consumers into a debt trap.   Congress should pass my bill to cap interest rates at 36% on these loans.  https://t.co/V6uIye3trK,2020-10-05 17:15:54,Twitter Web App,29,151

This @wapo chart says it all.  COVID-19 has hit our lowest-paid workers overwhelmingly women &amp; people of color the hardest.
