Today I announced a constitutional amendment that would raise the threshold for the House to impeach a President.   We can’t let partisan actors like @SpeakerPelosi put our country through this kind of partisan nightmare again. https://t.co/rb9RbrAZkw,2020-02-06 22:48:42,Twitter for iPhone,617,2204
Today the Senate ACQUITTED President @realDonaldTrump on all charges.   The impeachment sham led by @SpeakerPelosi and @RepAdamSchiff FAILED.   Now we need to work hard over the next 9 months to re-elect President Trump and elect Republicans across the country!,2020-02-05 22:06:04,Twitter for iPhone,599,2583
.@SpeakerPelosi tore up @realDonaldTrump’s #SOTU speech.   You want to know why?   Because the speeech described an America that is on the move and is ready to re-elect President Trump! 🇺🇸  If I were a Democrat I’d want to pretend that speech didn’t happen too. #PettyPelosi,2020-02-05 03:57:26,Twitter for iPhone,652,2967
Looks like last night was a terrible night for @JoeBiden. I guess I should do an ad about @BernieSanders next.   When voters are confronted with Biden’s corruption they run the other way as fast as possible.   RT 🔁 to share the ad Biden doesn’t want you to see! https://t.co/oiWQh0Tiu9,2020-02-04 14:10:26,Twitter for iPhone,240,621
.@JoeBiden still thinks the American people are stupid.   The Democrats are working overtime to cover up his corruption. We can’t let them. https://t.co/1UZq8czRBG,2020-02-03 21:00:24,Twitter for iPhone,86,283
Great halftime show from @JLo and @Shakira. But no @Pitbull? America was robbed. #Dale #LoveFL,2020-02-03 01:35:57,Twitter for iPhone,252,1657
Republicans have their “nice little legal Constitutional defenses.”   Democrats just have their hatred of @realDonaldTrump.   I’ll take the former over the latter. https://t.co/9622tr8xzT,2020-02-01 15:59:58,Twitter for iPhone,2331,7168
Tomorrow my ad exposing @JoeBiden's corruption goes up on the air in Iowa!   Watch it below and tune in tonight to @IngrahamAngle at 10:30pm. I'll be talking about it and the last day (hopefully) of the Dems' impeachment circus. https://t.co/BDzc2D0zWH,2020-01-31 02:45:15,Sprout Social,5778,15687
It’s about you and your son’s corruption that the Democrat Establishment is trying to cover up @JoeBiden.   You can watch it here: https://t.co/n1qB9ENzIK https://t.co/IZdXw4AxGZ,2020-01-30 00:15:59,Twitter for iPhone,133,356
Last night I sat down with @BretBaier to talk about my new ad exposing the truth about @JoeBiden.   It’s time for Republicans to stand up and fight back against the cover up by the Democrats and the media! https://t.co/5lFsNrv32K,2020-01-29 16:42:51,Twitter for iPhone,265,815
I’ve been held hostage with 99 other people in the U.S. Capitol. Why? Because the Democrats hate @realDonaldTrump and are trying to cover up @JoeBiden’s corruption.   Watch the full story ⬇️ https://t.co/MdFvHl5lb5,2020-01-28 22:06:49,Sprout Social,8427,18581
Today the American people heard the truth from the @WhiteHouse team about Hunter Biden’s shady dealings in Ukraine.   The truth is this entire partisan impeachment of @realDonaldTrump is really just an attempt to cover up @JoeBiden’s corruption.,2020-01-28 01:20:43,Twitter for iPhone,675,2225
Spotted @BernieSanders hopping on his private jet to fly out to Iowa and campaign with @AOC on their “Green New Deal.”  Good thing they haven’t eliminated air travel yet! https://t.co/TULQ185Ryf,2020-01-25 18:55:48,Twitter for iPad,433,1298
.@BernieSanders is right. The Democrat establishment is trying to rig their primary to help @JoeBiden just like they did for Hillary in 2016.   I guess that’s what you have to do when your frontrunner is such a weak candidate.   https://t.co/uVxbjR3Ty3,2020-01-25 14:32:19,Twitter for iPhone,45,157
This is a hugely important exchange. Millions of Americans are in the same position as this man. Many have worked hard and saved to pay off their or their family’s student loans.   @ewarren and her socialist agenda don’t care about American families like his. https://t.co/Il4IPPlfYN,2020-01-24 02:47:17,Twitter for iPhone,351,944
The Democrats are trying to overturn @realDonaldTrump’s historic 2016 election win. They just hate Trump. That’s all this is.   House Dems’ time is up. The Senate’s in charge now. We won’t let the liberal mob run the show. https://t.co/aegjVDjumS,2020-01-21 17:41:13,Twitter for iPhone,5647,19197
