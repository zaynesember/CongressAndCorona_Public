As one of the largest democracies in our hemisphere Brazil shouldn't dismiss the threat of Communist China &amp; should rethink its dependence on the regime.

I’m glad that the Administration is taking aggressive action to stop the flow of money to state sponsors of terrorism.   Those that support Iran will be held responsible for propping up a regime that sponsors terrorism worldwide. https://t.co/37DJ6LmYeE,2020-10-19 20:26:44,Twitter for iPhone,75,175
Americans are hurting and instead of working in good faith to negotiate a realistic deal to help those in need @SpeakerPelosi is just playing politics.

There is no reason why any country should sell arms to Iran.   Iran is a leading sponsor of terror around the world. No one should be providing them with the tools to continue doing so and any that do are supporting terrorism. https://t.co/vMg0O2JThJ,2020-10-18 20:19:48,Twitter for iPhone,201,459

This is a story people should be talking about. In recent months the @federalreserve has bought up more than 50% of US Treasuries.

Congress is talking about spending another $1 trillion or more when we don’t know if or how the $ already allocated has been spent.

This Op-Ed by @nrarmour is spot-on. I’ve been saying it for months now. The IOC choosing to ignore human rights abuses by Communist China is not in the best interest of the @Olympics the international community or those being oppressed.

No surprise that the Chinese Govt is using @tiktok_us to spy. That’s why @HawleyMO &amp; I introduced a bill to ban all federal employees from using it on U.S. government devices.

We must take every precaution to protect families &amp; healthcare workers. https://t.co/SjXHhw1PnV,2020-03-13 18:54:54,Twitter Web App,21,128
This is unhinged. Communist China will say and do anything to avoid responsibility for their role in allowing the Chinese #Coronavirus to spread.   They lied about it. Covered it up. Silenced doctors who were sounding the alarm. They let their own people die. Shameful. https://t.co/uVthsdjsIX,2020-03-13 16:27:49,Twitter for iPhone,924,1355

My first priority is to make sure that everyone who wants a test can get tested for #Coronavirus.   The best economic stimulus package is to stem the spread of the virus. The best way to do that is to immediately expand testing and put out as much information as possible. https://t.co/13LRS88PWp,2020-03-12 22:15:11,Twitter Web App,188,663

Eighth we should free up time and resources to ensure researchers can get a vaccine done quickly.,2020-03-12 15:11:18,Twitter for iPhone,9,53
Seventh all hospitals need to prepare to halt elective procedures to ensure there are enough beds available for the sick.,2020-03-12 15:10:57,Twitter for iPhone,8,26

Second the United States should temporarily shut down all U.S. borders to foreign tourism. If Americans choose to go on an international trip they must submit to a health screening and a 14-day quarantine upon their return to the United States. Containment is key.,2020-03-12 15:09:09,Twitter for iPhone,18,51
First we need to enhance and scale the testing process so more people can get tested. Similar to what has been implemented in South Korea we need to immediately open mobile testing sites where people can get tested using a drive-up window like a fast-food restaurant.,2020-03-12 15:08:42,Twitter for iPhone,20,58
The American people are not getting the information and care that they deserve.   The health of all Americans must be our sole priority at this time.

Glad to see Johns Hopkins change course but why did this happen in the first place? Who requested this change?

Si bien los demócratas impulsan el socialismo es importante recordar lo que esta ideología le ha hecho a la Cuba que alguna vez fue prospera.  No tienen dinero trabajo comida o derechos humanos.

While Democrats push Socialism it’s important to remember what this discredited ideology has done to a once-vibrant Cuba.   No money work food or human rights.

This is very concerning and exactly why I have asked the Administration to declare a national public health emergency.  We need to be well equipped to help Americans.

Today is day 4 of my “Let’s Get Back to Work” series.   Today we hear from Peter Vivaldi from Orlando FL.

Following my letter to @POTUS I applaud the Administration for taking swift action to combat the threat of counterfeit goods from Communist China.

House Democrats spent yesterday defending Joe Biden &amp; Hunter Biden.  Reminder: with no relevant experience Hunter Biden was paid more than 12x the average board compensation of similarly sized companies by Burisma. Why? His father was the Vice President. https://t.co/moX3USSL42,2020-01-24 15:02:30,Twitter Web App,70,172
This week I invited @SecWilkie to join me in FL and hear firsthand from our veterans about the daily challenges that our American heroes face.

Today’s commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz is a stark and solemn reminder of what evil and hatred can lead to.   As one nation we must always stand together against anti-Semitism and hatred. https://t.co/XQ837lsCFX,2020-01-24 00:50:44,Twitter for iPhone,51,166
El pasado mayo advertí que la situación en #VZ era una amenaza clara para nuestra seguridad nacional. Se ha convertido en un refugio seguro para malos actores y organizaciones terroristas.   Aquí hay otro ejemplo. Lea mi editorial del año pasado aquí: https://t.co/6NTlPmAFtO,2020-01-23 22:44:01,Twitter Web App,15,35
Last May I warned that the situation in #Venezuela was a clear and present threat to our national security. It’s become a safe haven for bad state actors and terrorist organizations.

House Democrats had their chance to build their case. They didn’t do it because they rushed this partisan impeachment through the House.  It’s not the Senate’s job to do the House’s work for them.

Communist China has one goal: to become the strongest global power.  And that means leveraging nations in need of assistance with “easy money” &amp; leaving them with mountains of debt. @SecPompeo is right it’s time the world sees the Chinese government’s true colors. https://t.co/oTnDDDX5r7,2020-01-23 18:10:35,Twitter Web App,1186,1499
.@marcorubio @SenTomCotton &amp; I reached out to @ahahospitals President Richard Pollack requesting information on steps taken to safeguard US research &amp; intellectual property from foreign adversaries.

Yesterday @marcorubio @RepTedDeutch &amp; I sent a letter to @POTUS urging his administration to continue to prioritize the release of American citizens currently being held hostage by the Iranian regime.

Day 1 of House Dems’ presentation has been like Groundhog Day: the same thing over and over and over again. It’s not convincing.   The Democrats hate @realDonaldTrump hate that he won in 2016 and are desperately trying to hurt his chances in 2020. It will backfire. https://t.co/tfGwt6ZAbC,2020-01-22 22:48:40,Twitter for iPhone,262,784
@washingtonpost @NicolasMaduro .@washingtonpost debe estar confundido.   @NicolasMaduro no es el presidente de #VZ. Es un terrorista y violador de derechos humanos contra su propio pueblo. Darle a un monstruo así una plataforma para promover su propaganda es ignorante y peligroso.,2020-01-22 20:57:53,Twitter Web App,20,53
.@washingtonpost must be confused.  @NicolasMaduro is not the President of #VZ. He is a terrorist and human rights violator against his own people.

Today I’m urging the @CDCgov to take swift action to combat the threat of the #coronavirus &amp; protect the health of Americans.

There’s only one word to describe yesterday’s Dem antics – boring.   @RepAdamSchiff &amp; his gang have no case. Repeating their talking points over and over and over again doesn’t help. Unlike the House process the Senate WILL have a fair trial with due process. https://t.co/zJkJe0Loay,2020-01-22 14:55:22,Twitter Web App,182,519
🚨LIVE TV ALERT!  Tune in to @Varneyco today at 9:15AM.  I’ll be talking about the late-night antics from House Democrats. They want to argue about process because they know there’s no substance to their case. This is all about politics and their hatred of @realDonaldTrump.,2020-01-22 13:50:51,Twitter Web App,33,111
The @SenateDems are arguing about process because the case brought by House Dems is weak &amp; lacking substance.   There will be a time and place to vote on whether to allow witnesses. Right now it’s clear that @RepAdamSchiff &amp; his gang are too scared to start their oral arguments.,2020-01-22 02:46:47,Twitter for iPhone,5171,16611
