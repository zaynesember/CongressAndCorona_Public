Counties across PA are still diligently working to certify the vote &amp; I'm still making election videos. Pres.

That's because despite bipartisan calls for additional processing time from Democratic and Republican County Commissioners across the Commonwealth Harrisburg Republicans refused to allow it. This is a pretty good explainer:   https://t.co/yYc8NZ5msw,2020-11-07 06:24:14,Twitter for iPhone,29,138

PENNSYLVANIA UPDATE 33: Take it from me a former PA Auditor General audits can be a good thing! And post-election audits are already pretty common in @GovernorTomWolf's Admin.

I expect we'll see that many of the provisional ballots in PA were cast in heavily Democratic areas like Philadelphia and its collar counties or out west in Allegheny County. My guess is that they'll skew significantly towards @JoeBiden no matter what anyone says. https://t.co/swn99XMT1B,2020-11-07 03:44:42,Twitter Web App,82,451

While Joe spoke to their concerns Donald Trump mocked them.

The cruelty of this President knows no bounds and lying to the American people only adds insult to injury. There is only one Presidential candidate who will stand up for the over 135 million Americans with a pre-existing condition and that candidate is Joe Biden.,2020-08-27 23:58:21,Twitter Web App,4,12
Where is his plan to protect the over 5 million Pennsylvanians with a pre-existing condition if his lawsuit to rip the protections away succeeds? GOP’s claims that the President’s health care sabotage has in any way protected pre-existing conditions is revisionist history.,2020-08-27 23:58:20,Twitter Web App,3,10
President Trump and his Republican allies are lying about their position on these critical protections. They have NO credibility to say they will protect people with pre-existing conditions and that's proven again every single day this lawsuit continues.,2020-08-27 23:58:20,Twitter Web App,2,7
If the Republican lawsuit is successful protections END for the 135 million with a pre-existing condition. This includes roughly half of nonelderly Americans 17 million children 68 million women and 30 million people aged 55-64. The uninsured rate will increase by 65 percent.,2020-08-27 23:58:20,Twitter Web App,2,7

President Trump's attacks are also hidden between the lines of other obscene attacks on the American people. See pg. 135 of his 2017 tax bill which allows states to let insurance companies charge you more because of a pre-existing condition. https://t.co/cDdQXFcdbB,2020-08-27 23:58:19,Twitter Web App,1,6
Instead of advocating for comprehensive health care coverage President Trump has backed a series of alternatives that give insurers more ability to avoid covering pre-existing conditions allowing short-term junk health insurance plans to flourish. https://t.co/a7PnAkfvdP,2020-08-27 23:58:19,Twitter Web App,1,6
