Can you imagine suddenly having your paycheck cut by 43% in the middle of an economic crisis? That’s exactly what Republicans are doing to the average unemployed worker by objecting to the extended benefits Democrats offered. /8,2020-07-31 19:49:14,Twitter Web App,20,110
This isn’t just simply the right thing to do. It also increases demand and puts money back into the economy. There’s absolutely no rhyme or reason. Republicans are turning their backs on working families. /7,2020-07-31 19:49:13,Twitter Web App,12,117
If Republicans cared about the middle class and the economy why wouldn’t they keep giving our unemployed workers the extra $600 they need to cover their bills and pay for food? /6,2020-07-31 19:49:13,Twitter Web App,14,120
If Republicans cared about the economy they’d first be laser focused on getting the pandemic under control. But half will barely acknowledge the pandemic and many of those remaining won’t challenge the President because they are scared he will tweet at them. /5,2020-07-31 19:49:13,Twitter Web App,19,127
Unemployment benefits expire today. One in four renters are at risk of evictions. Resources for state and local governments are dried up. Republicans have thrown away their own ideology to pander to a corrupt President. /4,2020-07-31 19:49:12,Twitter Web App,25,124
Millions of workers are unemployed and families are losing their paychecks through no fault of their own. Just last week 1.4 million Americans filed new claims for unemployment. And Republicans want to take $1600 out of their pockets every single month. /3,2020-07-31 19:49:12,Twitter Web App,27,117
Democrats passed the HEROES Act in MAY. Republicans sat on their hands for TWO MONTHS blocking relief for working families and what did they come up with? A demand for corporate immunity and a skinflint proposal which would be catastrophic for our economy. /2,2020-07-31 19:49:12,Twitter Web App,46,180
What we saw on the Senate floor this week was a disgrace to our democracy.

Rent's due tomorrow &amp; 1/4 renters risk eviction.  These aren't just aggregate statistics. These are families who are living in fear of losing the roof over their heads in the middle of a pandemic.  But Republicans in Congress would rather block #HEROES than support #RentReliefNow,2020-07-31 18:15:20,Twitter Web App,81,211
An unconstitutional citizenship q scare. A fear-mongering executive order targeting immigrants.

#Medicaid serves as a lifeline for millions. Congress must take up my bill the Coronavirus Medicaid Response Act and short of that must invest in Medicaid in any future #COVID relief like the House of Representatives did nearly three months ago.,2020-07-30 22:13:32,Twitter Web App,9,51

The GOP "proposal" doesn't just fail to address health care needs during #COVID19. It could be catastrophic for the economy.

To add insult to injury this past Sunday was the 30th anniv of the Americans with Disabilities Act which extended civil rights protections to people with disabilities.

.@realdonaldtrump has always sent subtle &amp; not so subtle signals to white supremacists welcoming their support. He calls them “very fine people.” He amplifies them on Twitter.

I used to believe you could hold the bad apples accountable one by one but I was wrong.

17 million Americans have gained coverage through Medicaid expansion  If the #TrumpLawsuit is successful millions of low-income Americans lose access to health care during a national pandemic.

My colleague brings up an important point: the President’s efforts to decimate Medicaid WILL cause rural hospital closures.

60% of young children in the U.S. spend time in non-parental child care each week provided by nearly 2 million early childhood educators.

With older adults and people with disabilities at higher risk we must ensure that there is enough money to support three square meals a day for seniors and policies that allow sufficient supply of medications and support for home and community-based services. https://t.co/OlFKpKCiDR,2020-03-17 21:08:22,Twitter for iPhone,13,34

Every American worker should be guaranteed paid family and sick leave.,2020-03-12 16:59:05,Twitter Web App,212,1237
Providing free testing for COVID-19.   Paid family and sick leave.  Bolstering unemployment insurance and SNAP benefits.    These measures aren’t an “ideological wish list.” They’re essential responses to this public health crisis. https://t.co/E9IcVNW8fF,2020-03-12 14:41:30,Twitter Web App,655,1764

Unbelievable. Senate Republicans just blocked the #ForThePeople Act - again.

A year has gone by since the House passed H.R. 1 an anti-corruption measure to limit money in politics and expand voting rights. @Senatemajldr should stop doing the bidding of special interests and stand up for Americans by bringing up S. 949 the #ForThePeople Act for a vote. https://t.co/hsCPfPgTL6,2020-03-08 15:22:50,Twitter for iPhone,61,183

Pennsylvanians: Your actual 2020 census card mailed to you mid-March will not say “Commissioned by the Republican Party” nor ask for any sort of payment.

Last fall my office released a report revealing how individuals are misled to choosing short-term junk plans which fail to meet basic ACA protections. Full report: https://t.co/r96va0DOXg,2020-02-26 14:35:01,Twitter Web App,7,30
The Trump Administration banked on these junk insurance plans claiming they make health care more affordable. Turns out that like this President’s health care policies they’re disastrous.  Full report by @LLSusa: https://t.co/tO8qnLgCQR,2020-02-26 14:35:00,Twitter Web App,11,33
“Consumers mistakenly assume that the plans w/ lower monthly costs will be better than no insurance at all in case of a medical catastrophe but often the plans aren’t very different from going without insurance altogether”  Junk plans are cheap - until you actually need coverage,2020-02-26 14:35:00,Twitter Web App,5,21
Just one example: After fearing he had coronavirus symptoms Mr. Azcue of Miami got tested – but what he ended up with was a huge out-of-pocket bill due to having a limited junk insurance plan. https://t.co/wryqqb6ppS,2020-02-26 14:35:00,Twitter Web App,9,27
The @LLSusa study found the deductible on a popular short-term plan was $12500 vs $4600 for the ACA-compliant plan costing patients much more in the long run.,2020-02-26 14:34:59,Twitter Web App,4,20
NEW STUDY: President Trump and Republican politicians allowed short-term junk health insurance plans to flourish by continuously working to sabotage the health insurance market and roll back critical consumer protections.

Turning Medicaid into a block grant program is a broken promise to this Nation and yet another part of this Administration’s blatant scheme to cut funding by $1.5 trillion.,2020-02-03 23:01:39,Twitter Web App,16,54
Congress has repeatedly rejected Republican plans to block-grant Medicaid because at its core block-granting reduces coverage yet the Trump Administration is continuing to push this plan as part of its maniacal obsession to slash the ACA &amp; sabotage the health care of millions. https://t.co/93t9e50aKZ,2020-02-03 23:01:38,Twitter Web App,45,117
By blocking relevant witnesses and relevant documents Senate Republicans have denied the American people the fair trial they deserve. This proceeding was rigged from the start to protect the President.,2020-02-01 01:19:51,Twitter Web App,396,1888

I was honored to deliver the Weekly Democratic Address and discuss the impeachment trial of President Trump.

In the history of the United States the Senate has never conducted a trial without witnesses. It’s my hope that Senate Republicans will put country over party today and vote to give Americans the fair trial they expect and deserve.

The President’s new block grant proposal is just another way to slash Medicaid and put health care for vulnerable Americans on the chopping block.

@LisaDNews @NewsHour What I’ve seen so far is this: a detailed and substantial presentation by the House Managers followed by disingenuous claims from the President’s attorneys. There is one thing of which I remain positive: Americans deserve a fair trial one that includes witnesses &amp; documents.,2020-01-27 17:33:33,Twitter Web App,41,224
@LisaDNews @NewsHour Day five. Ahead of their first day of presentations it was my hope the President’s attorneys would present a substantive argument as to why President Trump’s actions were not impeachable.
