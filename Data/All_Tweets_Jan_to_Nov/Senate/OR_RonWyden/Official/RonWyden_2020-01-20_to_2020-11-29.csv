Instead of renewing supercharged unemployment benefits which have kept our economy afloat for months Senate Republicans want to:   1) Cut the income of 30 million Americans   2) Give everyone else a fake tax cut they'll have to repay after the election https://t.co/8f2HngyluU,2020-07-20 20:11:24,Twitter for iPhone,231,381

Mitch McConnell is forcing a Senate vote on his amendment to give Bill Barr warrantless access to Americans’ browsing history. I’ve heard a lot of bad ideas in my lifetime but this is one of the worst. Tune in as I explain why: https://t.co/r53nm2HxzA,2020-05-13 15:55:31,Periscope,1959,3246

Good discussion yesterday with Oregon hospitals. Under the #COVID19 relief package hospitals in rural areas and on the front lines can get their Medicare payments up front so they’re able to continue serving patients even when they are short of funds.,2020-03-31 15:11:59,Twitter for iPhone,54,285

Hours ago Senate Republicans called the Democratic plan to help American workers by supercharging unemployment benefits a “drafting error”. Ignoring this crisis won’t make it go away.

While not a panacea for the health and economic impacts of #COVID19 this package will help American families workers and businesses weather this storm.

Here's a quick look at some of the provisions included in this deal that I've been fighting for:   ✅A historic expansion of unemployment benefits ✅A tax credit for businesses to keep workers on payroll ✅Critical funding for state and local health care systems,2020-03-26 04:01:12,Twitter for iPhone,17,71
Thanks to Democratic leadership and hours of negotiation we were able to get this deal done the right way to help Americans in need. This legislation will get real dollars to workers and small businesses who are struggling to stay afloat. https://t.co/wjEpFuSp3v,2020-03-26 04:01:06,Twitter for iPhone,104,508
My plan to supercharge unemployment benefits by $600 per week would do a lot more for hard-hit workers than one-off lump sums.

While pushing corporate bailouts Senate Republicans are also trying to strip my provision to expand unemployment insurance from the #COVID19 package.

When unemployment insurance was created in the 1930s no one ever used the term gig economy worker.

This is the right decision. Our country has a long history of taking swift action when our constitutional rights are on the line.

I just voted no on the partisan #COVID19  bill.

I will stay here as long it takes to get this done the right way.,2020-03-22 23:09:20,Twitter for iPhone,18997,79692

To make matters worse Republicans are trying to include a no-strings-attached corporate slush fund that could bail out Donald Trump’s friends and his businesses. That's a non-starter for Democrats.,2020-03-22 19:58:19,Twitter for iPhone,150,481

That's what supercharging unemployment insurance is all about. Here’s the bottom line: workers are going to need consistent income while they’re out of work and that’s what unemployment assistance would provide.,2020-03-20 18:29:46,Twitter for iPhone,45,251

My top priority right now is getting more help to the workers who have lost their jobs overnight. If you’re going to be out of work for weeks or even months a one-time check as proposed by Republicans doesn’t do much for you.,2020-03-20 18:29:45,Twitter for iPhone,191,886
