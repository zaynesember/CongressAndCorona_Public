48 hours after being elected the next president of the United States @JoeBiden appointed a task force of scientists and doctors to lead the charge in beating #COVID19. The Trump administration is going on vacation. https://t.co/uQQ3N0sgaW,2020-11-10 21:21:47,Twitter for iPhone,0,3
Today decency and compassion won. The road ahead won’t be an easy one but I know @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris are up to the task of building our country back better. For everyone. Let the work begin.,2020-11-07 16:56:50,Twitter for iPhone,2,25

Senate Republicans are preparing to confirm another conservative Justice to the Supreme Court to rip health care away from 130 million Americans in the middle of a pandemic. Remember that on November 3.,2020-10-20 15:45:54,Twitter for iPhone,1,4

Republicans care more about setting the country back 50 years with their extremist agenda than they do about helping working families. If you didn’t already have enough reasons to vote them out in November there’s one more. https://t.co/sx0z7Po2iO,2020-10-07 17:47:08,Twitter for iPhone,22,31

Justice Ginsburg's death is a staggering loss for all of us. We must honor her by respecting her final wishes. The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice. Therefore this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president.,2020-09-19 03:31:10,Twitter for iPhone,4,25
America will be in good hands with @KamalaHarris as Vice President.,2020-08-20 04:04:16,Twitter for iPhone,0,9
Donald Trump is running a campaign rooted in hatred and bigotry. Tonight Democrats showed America that a vote for @JoeBiden is a vote for bringing back jobs reducing gun violence tackling our climate crisis and creating an America for all. The choice is clear. #DemConvention,2020-08-20 03:34:32,Twitter for iPhone,1,10
Very proud to stand with @ORDems for tonight's #DemConvention Roll Call. Oregonians are ready to elect a president that fights for working families not special interests. https://t.co/GkYjpRU6R3,2020-08-19 03:38:48,Twitter for iPhone,4,32
.@JoeBiden is showing us the path toward inclusion civility and a united front against our health and jobs crises.   @realDonaldTrump is steering us toward more divisiveness and hate.  The right choice for America is clear.  #DemConvention #WeThePeople,2020-08-18 03:12:50,Twitter for iPhone,1,11

Donald Trump is sabotaging our elections and destroying the American way of life. Senate Republicans are letting him get away with it.

I’ve seen firsthand @KamalaHarris‘s unwavering commitment to bettering the lives of Americans. This is a much-deserved &amp; historic honor that breaks barriers for future generations.

Georgia deserves a Senator that will fight to level the playing field for working families. Not someone who prioritizes special interests and shady corporations.

This is a huge win for Dreamers in Oregon and nationwide but our work isn't done. Now the Senate must vote on legislation to give ironclad protections to protect Dreamers from deportation.

It's unconscionable that in 2020 being true to who you are or who you love could get you fired from your job. This ruling is a huge victory and gives all of us even more to celebrate during #Pride2020. https://t.co/Eow6N5arhX,2020-06-15 17:04:00,Twitter for iPhone,0,2

Americans shouldn't have to choose between their health and their right to vote.  #VoteByMail is the solution.  It's time for Congress to pass my bill with @amyklobuchar to give every American the option to #VoteAtHome this November. https://t.co/A1SqyLC3SN,2020-04-23 19:18:49,Twitter Web App,6,5
Americans shouldn't be forced to choose between staying healthy and exercising their right to vote.

Thanks to Donald Trump this November your health care is on the ballot. The only way to safeguard protections for pre-existing conditions against Republican sabotage is to vote them out of office.
