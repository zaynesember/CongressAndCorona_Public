This week FCC Chairman Pai agreed with me—we must close the Homework Gap &amp; digital divide especially given the harsh inequities further exposed by COVID-19.

A very important day for Dreamers and our country. SCOTUS ruled that Trump's decision to end DACA was “arbitrary and capricious.”   But this doesn’t mean our work is over.   The ball is in our court.

The Trump Administration wants to gut our bipartisan bill and block us from holding China accountable for its brutal crackdown of Hong Kong.  Bolton's book tells us why.

Thanks to all the kids parents and Maryland partners who joined. https://t.co/FolqxwBlCs,2020-05-08 21:45:53,Twitter Web App,11,60
We must mobilize national service to help with COVID-19 and key future priorities. Proud to work with @ChrisCoons @SenMarkey and others to deploy 750000 workers to address public health food insecurity and the Homework Gap. Let’s get this passed! #Stand4Service https://t.co/VyseJPAJuq,2020-05-08 19:04:36,Twitter Web App,31,80
Maryland is lucky to have organizations like Lifebridge that have been helping produce protective gear for hospital staff. I have also urged the Trump Administration to step up its efforts to use the DPA to expand the production of PPE and testing equipment. https://t.co/rrhM5QY4sT,2020-05-08 17:32:29,Twitter Web App,9,39
The cold blooded murder of Ahmaud happened more than 73 days ago and yet only now are the perpetrators being charged—and only after the video came out a few days ago. Justice in America should not have to wait until a video emerges. #JusticeForAhmaud,2020-05-08 03:13:46,Twitter for iPhone,82,365
We need many more workers to conduct the large-scale testing and contact tracing necessary to safely “re-open.” Congress should include our bill to expand AmeriCorps and other national service programs and provide fair pay in the next relief bill. https://t.co/qHRhQodyEF,2020-05-07 22:10:47,Twitter Web App,30,81
This is a total assault on the rule of law and justice. Under AG Barr the Department of Justice has become a glorified arm of the Trump campaign to help the President attack political adversaries and reward political friends. https://t.co/5ykVSBqSWA,2020-05-07 20:39:33,Twitter Web App,47,150
The Supreme Court must act like the independent branch it was designed to be not become an accessory to the Trump cover-up efforts.  https://t.co/c0cNNd1ir6,2020-05-07 18:08:50,Twitter Web App,58,127
Title III of the Defense Production Act has been totally underutilized despite our country's desperate need for supplies like swabs for testing masks for medical workers and more. Mr. President you have the power and the funds—it’s long past time to put the pedal to the metal. https://t.co/q2Dh4BQkvQ,2020-05-06 23:08:11,Twitter Web App,21,61
Hiding the death toll as part of a strategy to downplay his disastrous response to the pandemic? Not only despicable but isn’t that what he accused China and Iran of doing? https://t.co/1s8W6wyw4S,2020-05-06 22:33:17,Twitter for iPhone,82,175
Instead of focusing on the coronavirus crisis the Trump Administration is continuing its all-out assault on women’s reproductive health and the ACA. Women’s access to affordable contraception should not be vetoed by their employers or anyone else.  https://t.co/jvyXVooyBN,2020-05-06 21:55:14,Twitter Web App,27,57
We must better protect and support our federal employees and contract workers including maximizing telework providing PPE on the job and ensuring hazard pay. Teamed up with a bipartisan group to urge the Administration to use their existing powers to get this done. https://t.co/mtGL0INPP3,2020-05-06 00:05:58,Twitter for iPhone,23,67
As a White House lawyer Brian Miller personally participated in stonewalling the GAO inquiry that found Trump broke the law by withholding aid from Ukraine. Covering up is apparently the criteria for IG nominations by Trump. The IGs who actually do their jobs get fired. https://t.co/rZIzIWJKh3,2020-05-05 23:37:32,Twitter Media Studio,42,104
I have repeatedly asked Secretary Mnuchin to change Treasury’s regulations so that the Paycheck Protection Program works better for small businesses and restaurants. He should not shut the door on them. https://t.co/W7ytw0pTS0,2020-05-05 00:22:51,Twitter Web App,37,101

From protecting our country’s interests abroad to helping stranded Americans return home during the pandemic—our #ForeignService Officers are vital to our success.

Now Trump wants to impose a gag order to stop Fauci from testifying to Congress. His excuse? That it would be “counterproductive." Translation: he doesn't want the public to hear the full truth like “don’t inject disinfectants” or “we need more rapid testing." Free Fauci! https://t.co/NYBqE592LT,2020-05-01 22:38:37,Twitter Web App,136,295
This is exactly why I’ve pressed @USGSA for details on what rent relief the Trump Hotel is requesting from them. Just see how American taxpayers are already footing the bill at Trump’s luxury hotel and lining his pockets. https://t.co/nCEHlcLXLd,2020-05-01 14:10:24,Twitter for iPhone,43,73
Good point you bring up. Need to do both provide them with the safety net of UI while finding a way to deploy their skills in the battle against COVID-19. @SenMarkey and I introduced the UNITE Act to do just that and we want to include it in the next bill. https://t.co/gDfKsMHcsM,2020-04-29 22:27:05,Twitter Web App,16,65
The Senate has important work to do but McConnell must put in place safeguards to protect Capitol Hill workers including many Marylanders on support staff cafeteria employees and police. We should support not undermine the efforts of DC MD and VA to stop the spread. https://t.co/SUL7lfTIV6,2020-04-29 19:03:51,Twitter Web App,21,47
Nursing homes have been hit especially hard by COVID-19. In Maryland alone 2/3 of all long-term care facilities have COVID-19 cases. Time is of the essence. We need the Trump Administration to release the $200 million from the CARES Act to help nursing homes seniors and staff. https://t.co/Q2idRNshmL,2020-04-29 18:24:44,Twitter Web App,10,36
The American people deserve to know that the President isn’t giving any secret favors to Deutsche Bank. It’s entirely unacceptable that the bank’s executives are refusing to disclose their recent deals with him. https://t.co/kTu8c2yZfN,2020-04-29 13:06:37,Twitter for iPhone,18,68
The Fed’s original guidance completely shut out many cities and counties from direct access to a key lending program. I'm glad they revisited this issue so now localities like Baltimore City will have direct access to this program. https://t.co/4KES33ZeaH,2020-04-28 22:51:08,Twitter Web App,18,60
Good news. They were in limbo but we just learned that thousands of evacuated Peace Corps volunteers who were required to return from overseas posts will qualify to receive unemployment compensation. I also hope they can return to their missions as soon as it is safe to do so!,2020-04-28 20:54:16,Twitter Web App,80,485
Deporting Dreamers like Jonathan Rodas from Towson who are working on the front lines of the battle against COVID-19 isn’t just a violation of our promises to them—it is plain stupid.

Today we remember the 1.5 million Armenians murdered by the Ottoman Empire. Last year Congress officially recognized and remembered this crime against humanity by passing the #ArmenianGenocide resolution. The first step in learning from history is to recognize it.,2020-04-25 01:13:14,Twitter Web App,28,97
Have heard from many Marylanders today having trouble accessing the state’s unemployment site.

Never knew we would have to say this to a president but there is no place for "sarcastic" comments on drinking or injecting bleach to treat COVID-19.   Americans are dying. Health care workers don’t have enough protective equipment. We don’t have enough tests. https://t.co/spfshS9MOT,2020-04-24 17:51:14,Twitter Web App,140,392
Now the Trump Organization is asking the Trump Administration to give the Trump Hotel a break? This is a recipe for abuse of power and undue influence. We must shine a light to stop Trump from again using the government to advance his financial interests. https://t.co/dCLTpNNmdh,2020-04-24 00:21:45,Twitter Web App,69,168
Another example of why Donald Trump is dangerous to our health: first he peddles unproven drugs and then removes those who focus on facts not fiction. We are all paying the price for Trump’s quackery. https://t.co/fpfr8bQsqi,2020-04-22 21:29:43,Twitter Web App,698,1703
This #EarthDay we face a serious threat to progress: Trump. We must stop him from using this pandemic to weaken environmental laws and help Big Oil.

Even as many struggle to put food on the table Republicans refused to include more nutrition assistance funding in Phase 3.5. But we’re not giving up and as we push for more support we’re asking Maryland to expand grocery delivery services for SNAP recipients. https://t.co/hARMib8l7t,2020-04-22 14:32:03,Twitter Web App,44,112
While we can't gather in person for Days of Remembrance we join together in virtual ceremonies around the world to remember the millions of lives lost and hear from survivors.

GM should never have closed its White Marsh plant but now they should reopen to manufacture ventilators. Hospitals tell us we require significantly more to help those in need. If they won’t act we need to use the Defense Production Act to make it happen. https://t.co/BQWTf2b0ri,2020-04-21 23:25:06,Twitter Web App,28,96
Phase 3.5 is better than McConnell's offer that shortchanged small businesses and didn’t prioritize testing or public health. It gets more funds to small businesses that don’t have a big bank on speed dial. But we need to cut red tape help local govs and start on next bill now.,2020-04-21 23:06:23,Twitter Web App,15,53
Republican politicians need to stop forcing Americans to risk their lives to exercise their right to vote! Every state needs a viable vote by mail option as well as safe early and same-day voting. https://t.co/VgXb76UYkh,2020-04-21 18:18:52,Twitter Web App,36,92
Russia interfered in our 2016 elections to help Trump win a conclusion reached by intel officials and the Republican-led Senate Intel Committee. Will my GOP colleagues convince McConnell to act to protect our future elections now? He’s been blocking the DETER Act for years. https://t.co/xKZWe9BolI,2020-04-21 17:55:40,Twitter Web App,60,157
As the pandemic continues we can't afford to let struggling families go hungry.

If Trump asks for an oil bailout remind him of the favors he’s already done for them including his ongoing effort to undo the safeguards put in place after the Deepwater Horizon disaster. As we’ve seen with COVID-19 we pay a huge price when he dismantles safety measures.,2020-04-20 23:39:18,Twitter Web App,45,207
Trump is delusional when he says we have enough COVID-19 test equipment and that swabs are “easy to get.” Health experts say we need 500000 tests/day nationwide to start reducing social distancing measures. Falling way short. Put DPA into overdrive for testing equipment now!,2020-04-20 20:48:56,Twitter Web App,53,163

7000+ Peace Corps volunteers were recalled and then left in the cold when they returned home. We should be doing everything in our power to enlist these patriotic leaders to help along with other national service volunteers.

Trump has been warned by public health officials and businesses that a rush to end social distancing without dramatically expanding testing will have grave consequences.

Trump’s plan to keep Americans safe during a pandemic?   Weaken health regulations that prevent mercury poisoning.   Trump’s math: more cases of child brain damage = more dollars into pockets of big polluters and their CEOs. https://t.co/0i7EIUbYF4,2020-04-16 16:01:08,Twitter Web App,49,66

Important step forward—the state heeded our calls to release COVID-19 data by zip code. Now that we’ve confirmed the virus is having a disproportionate impact on people of color we need to implement a public health strategy to provide additional support to minority communities. https://t.co/0kQDNomsW4,2020-04-13 17:08:05,Twitter Web App,28,107
Yesterday we offered an amendment to help small businesses healthcare workers and state and local governments.

Private student loan borrowers need the same relief that federal borrowers got in the CARES Act.

Less than two weeks ago the Senate passed an emergency relief package by 96-0. But today McConnell decided to play partisan games and tried to ram through a bill that doesn’t fix key problems.

The GOP is pulling a political stunt and won't come to the table to improve the Paycheck Protection Program so money gets out to the door to small businesses. They need it and so do healthcare providers and local governments. Speaking about this shortly. https://t.co/rpNBFZzLlC,2020-04-09 14:13:57,Twitter Web App,158,271
The DMV area is on track to become the next COVID-19 hotspot.

We’re asking FEMA to prioritize this immediately. https://t.co/bP0ygPJW8Y,2020-04-08 23:53:30,Twitter Web App,59,110
We need more funds for the new program to support struggling small businesses and nonprofits but many are having trouble accessing that help. As we increase funding we must eliminate barriers so all can benefit and also boost help for health workers and other key priorities. https://t.co/hf9G54vRCz,2020-04-08 22:33:07,Twitter Media Studio,13,46
At the White House briefing Trump needs to correct the record—not give more mixed messages. Bullying @WHO is the last thing he should be doing in the midst of a global pandemic. We cannot politicize the coronavirus away. We need to work together to save lives.,2020-04-08 22:08:27,Twitter Web App,79,294
Had a good phone call with MD’s superintendents. We discussed the urgent need to close the digital divide to ensure every student can benefit from distance learning now and after the pandemic. CARES provides money that can be used for this but fighting for more in the next round.,2020-04-08 20:30:06,Twitter Web App,7,87
The CDC must immediately release data so we can determine whether COVID-19 is having disproportionate impacts on communities of color or other demographic groups.

The SBA Paycheck Protection Program has been open for less than a week and is facing many bottlenecks.

Trump just can't stop playing politics even when lives are at stake.   We need an independent watchdog to force accountability on this Administration for the $2 trillion emergency relief package.

As Maryland schools remain closed through April 24th and transition to online learning we must ensure that ALL students have access to the internet and a computer.

In 24 hours Trump has exploited the cover of crisis to fire the intelligence IG for doing his job and nominated a White House partisan to oversee the emergency response fund. More revenge and cronyism at a time we desperately need at least a shred of competence and integrity.,2020-04-04 16:07:03,Twitter Web App,133,416
States need more medical supplies and testing NOW. In Maryland medical professionals are reusing protective equipment as they run low on masks and testing is limited.

GOP negotiators intentionally shorted DC $700M in the CARES Act—absolutely shameful. We’re calling on Congress to reverse that injustice. As we fight for resources for Maryland—and statehood for DC—we must also help our neighbors in the District.

7000 Peace Corps Volunteers were recalled from overseas then left in the cold here at home. That is simply wrong. FEMA should enlist their help to fight the pandemic but at least after serving our country they should be eligible for the unemployment benefits in the CARES Act. https://t.co/oW45OiPRo9,2020-04-03 13:47:46,Twitter Web App,38,113
Good to see that Treasury is reversing course and listening to 40+ Senators.

With a COVID-19 outbreak on the USS Theodore Roosevelt Capt. Crozier spoke out to protect the safety of the over 5000-person crew aboard including Marylanders.

Hoy es el #DíaDelCenso. Su hogar debería haber recibido una invitación para completar el Censo. Mientras luchamos contra la crisis del COVID-19 es vital que todos lo completen.

After first using the cover of the COVID-19 crisis to relax enforcement of pollution controls on power plants Trump is working to reverse environmental standards on car emissions. This climate change denial from the president who called COVID-19 a “hoax.” We will fight this! https://t.co/nmk0g0SaDD,2020-03-31 23:31:50,Twitter Web App,70,191
Yesterday Trump claimed that our testing issues are solved.   Today I spoke to the heads of two of Maryland’s major hospitals who discussed the big shortage of tests in our state.   Mr. President stop bragging about your TV ratings and get states the testing and PPE we need.,2020-03-31 20:33:31,Twitter Web App,191,564
Sometimes heroes don’t wear capes but neon blue tuxedos! For his 10th birthday Jonah Infante raised over $2000 to help kids coping with cancer get art supplies. Great to see Marylanders of all ages helping those in need. https://t.co/VR5Iz9tOFn,2020-03-31 18:41:39,Twitter Media Studio,14,61

Amazing how the GOP McConnell and Trump always try to blame Nancy Pelosi for their own screw-ups. The Phase 3 emergency bill was developed and delayed in the Senate not the House. Remember Pelosi steered Phase 1 and 2 through House without a hitch. https://t.co/BqR1Ufvbld https://t.co/QoBgH3Cm4q,2020-03-30 19:46:42,Twitter Web App,65,183
Hope this helped answer some of your questions. We’ll continue to provide additional information in the coming weeks about different provisions in Phase 3 and how Marylanders can access these economic benefits to help keep them afloat through this crisis. https://t.co/w5eaEbXpOd,2020-03-27 23:02:37,Twitter Web App,13,34
7. When will I receive my payment?   Secretary Mnuchin has a goal of April 6th and hopefully the Trump Administration can meet that but it could take longer. https://t.co/h67DVNVU6N,2020-03-27 23:02:37,Twitter Web App,6,13
6. Will I receive my payment via direct deposit or mail?   If the IRS has your direct deposit information from a tax return you'll receive it electronically. If not you'll receive your check in the mail.,2020-03-27 23:02:36,Twitter Web App,5,8
5. How will I receive my payment?   Payments are sent automatically and will be based on income information from your 2019 tax return 2018 tax return or Social Security/Railroad Retirement benefit record. If you don't receive an automatic payment file a tax return to claim it.,2020-03-27 23:02:36,Twitter Web App,10,8
4. Will I get a $1200 payment?  Yes if you’re single making less than $75000 or the head of household making less than $112500. Married couples get $2400 if they make under $150000. Parents get $500 per child.  If you make more check with this tool: https://t.co/zt48HLleMA,2020-03-27 23:02:36,Twitter Web App,8,9
3. How long can an unemployed individual receive benefits?   You can receive up to 39 weeks of regular benefits which is a 13-week increase from the current limit of 26 weeks. The additional $600 runs until July 31st.,2020-03-27 23:02:36,Twitter Web App,7,11
2. How much are unemployment benefits increased by?  $600 per week for 4 months.   This is on top of current unemployment benefits which are on a scale from $50-$430 in Maryland—enough to replace the salaries of many workers. In our state benefits could be up to $1030 per week.,2020-03-27 23:02:35,Twitter Web App,8,17
1. How do I know if I qualify for unemployment benefits?   If you were laid off you are likely eligible.   The Phase 3 package expands eligibility—adding self-employed part-time and gig economy workers—if they lost their job or income due to COVID-19. https://t.co/IhXaKHaqzZ,2020-03-27 23:02:34,Twitter Web App,8,17

Empty threats won’t do us good. Trump has the authority to fully apply the Defense Production Act but hasn't. Congress has boosted funding for critical supplies—but there isn't enough being produced. Shortages stem not from a lack of $ but a lack of planning and political will. https://t.co/ClYUxlndjv,2020-03-27 17:30:06,Twitter Web App,39,129
In addition to the funds Maryland will receive from legislation the Senate just passed I’m glad FEMA heeded our call to declare a Major Disaster in Maryland. This will give our state more resources for our frontline workers and funds to ramp up our response against COVID-19. https://t.co/o0stmvOoP6,2020-03-27 02:32:07,Twitter for iPhone,23,120
We had to fight hard to protect workers and when Trump shamelessly tried to use this crisis to get a blank check for his personal slush fund we established important safeguards. Still McConnell did block other important items. The fight goes on.,2020-03-26 04:33:01,Twitter for iPhone,32,143
This package has many flaws and I would have written it differently but it provides urgently needed support to those on the front lines against the coronavirus and to those hardest hit by the economic fallout. This rescue plan will help us weather the storm.,2020-03-26 04:33:00,Twitter for iPhone,43,217
Surely in a $2 trillion in emergency relief we can do right by the people of the District of Columbia.  But the answer I got back was no it's not a mistake.  Republican negotiators insisted on shortchanging residents who pay more taxes than people in 22 states. Shameful. https://t.co/fus3okWqgb,2020-03-26 03:02:59,Twitter Media Studio,800,1730
Even during a crisis the Maryland spirit shines. Neighbors help those who need it most.

We’ve been working 24/7 on Phase 3 of the urgent federal response to the health crisis and the economic fallout from COVID-19.

Tens of thousands of Americans are still stranded abroad. Hundreds of Marylanders. The State Department has made limited progress with flights.

Right now our country is at the point where we are asking people to donate masks and medical supplies.  Think about that for a second.  Trump needs to use the Defense Production Act now. He’s stalling to look out for special interest groups? Americans can't wait any longer. https://t.co/zGPUjhDk6y,2020-03-23 22:53:24,Twitter Web App,195,490
Here’s the thing: McConnell is pointing fingers but Democrats are at the table. Rather than playing politics he could have delayed the vote until later today and committed to a bipartisan bill. This was all for a partisan show while our country suffers. https://t.co/PNka5nmhcS,2020-03-23 20:05:25,Twitter Web App,232,598
Even during a pandemic Trump is supporting a lawsuit to destroy protections for many most at risk of COVID-19.

We are all paying the price for this gross negligence: it turns out that after Trump axed the White House office created to fight pandemics they also eliminated a key American CDC scientist assigned to China to detect outbreaks of the disease. https://t.co/ygQyDduvxc,2020-03-23 14:03:22,Twitter for iPhone,198,302
Bad news. After saying they wanted to join us in helping workers families and small + midsized businesses that are going under Trump and McConnell have taken a total U-turn.

Let’s say you’re a self-employed event planner.   You may now be out of business but you’re not eligible for unemployment insurance.

Providing mom and pop businesses with an emergency loan when no customers are coming in the door is just going to saddle them with more debt they can’t pay off.  They need grants to tide them over.

After the Ebola outbreak Obama created a special office at the National Security Council to lead during a pandemic. Trump dissolved it in 2018 and this White House was unprepared.

Our question to both sides: Are you opposed to having the Chief Justice make the initial determinations regarding the relevance of documents and witnesses to the impeachment charges particularly as the Senate could disagree with the Chief Justice’s ruling by a majority vote? https://t.co/4nqjzBegEm,2020-01-31 00:54:30,Twitter Media Studio,67,162
Well said @RepAdamSchiff.   The House Managers agreed to have the Chief Justice rule on witness testimony and to respect his decisions.   Why won’t the President’s lawyers?   I hope my Republican colleagues will vote yes on my motion to make this impartial idea a reality. https://t.co/Osr5CqlmNZ,2020-01-30 18:51:09,Twitter Media Studio,136,374
This is absolutely repugnant. Doing this would send a statement to any future whistleblower: If you use legal channels to expose abuses of power you will be retaliated against. We live in a democracy not an autocratic state. https://t.co/c27grVlD1D,2020-01-30 18:05:44,Twitter Web App,566,1802
Remember this when Trump said his tax cuts for the wealthy would “start to rock” the economy to growth rates of “4% 5% and maybe even 6%"?  Well millionaires certainly “rocked” with their huge tax cuts but for the rest of the country?   The economy only grew 2.3% in 2019. https://t.co/4vuO9KTthh https://t.co/qpMbFbERUs,2020-01-30 16:50:40,Twitter Web App,348,685
The Trump Tax Scam for the wealthy and big corporations has pushed the annual deficit over $1 trillion and now the other shoe is dropping—Republicans say we have to cut Social Security Medicare and Medicaid to foot the bill. Get the word out. https://t.co/aqS9kBz4qm,2020-01-30 14:25:32,Twitter for iPhone,146,194
On Friday I plan to offer a motion that will require Chief Justice Roberts to:  1. Subpoena witnesses and documents if he determines they are relevant.  2. Rule on any claims of executive privilege in order to expedite the trial. https://t.co/z7rc3PYZzA,2020-01-30 00:27:56,Twitter Web App,360,966
The President’s defense team couldn’t answer my question on Bolton. It’s yet another reason we need to hear directly from Bolton himself. As I’ve said the truth will come out one way or another. It’s up to Republicans to decide if they want to stand on the right side of history. https://t.co/RVrlTnGCwN,2020-01-29 23:21:09,Twitter Media Studio,194,516
My first question to the President's defense team and the House managers: What did National Security Advisor John Bolton mean when he referenced “whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up on this” and did he ever raise that issue in any meeting with President Trump?,2020-01-29 23:12:06,Twitter Web App,75,251
Today will begin the Q&amp;A portion of the impeachment trial. Senators will have the chance to ask questions to both the House managers and the President’s defense team. I have a few prepared which will be written on this notecard and asked by the Chief Justice on my behalf. https://t.co/EX9I1zdBPh,2020-01-29 18:08:53,Twitter for iPhone,21,64
The EPA’s response today ducks the main question we asked: do they plan to enforce the pollution reduction targets in the Chesapeake Bay Agreement?   Failure to enforce puts the heath of the Bay at risk.  Without stronger assurances we must take them to court. https://t.co/UGaECN45zg,2020-01-29 15:39:08,Twitter Web App,47,97
Trump's one-sided plan is a recipe for even deeper division and undermines efforts to achieve a viable and sustainable two-state solution that supports the legitimate rights and aspirations of both Israelis and Palestinians.   Our Senate letter to President Trump: https://t.co/pvoGj6wJT8,2020-01-28 23:50:51,Twitter Web App,554,1638
I believe all Americans deserve the truth regardless of political party or what cable network shows they watch.   Let me know which facts you disagree with from my interview on Fox @realDonaldTrump.   Don’t you want the whole truth and nothing but the truth? https://t.co/V7LRG17092,2020-01-28 20:16:16,Twitter Media Studio,134,429
This one-sided proposal is a cynical maneuver calculated to be rejected by the Palestinians and then green-light illegal annexation.   It undermines decades of bipartisan U.S. policy and international law. Far from the “deal of the century” this is the “disaster of the decade.”,2020-01-28 17:31:14,Twitter Web App,90,220
Timing is everything here.  The Trump plan is not about advancing peace.  It’s a deliberately timed ploy to interfere in the Israeli elections by distracting attention from Netanyahu’s formal indictment for bribery today and to divert from Trump’s impeachment proceedings.,2020-01-28 17:31:14,Twitter Web App,117,289
The so-called Trump “peace plan” will only lead to more division and conflict.    Claiming to advance peace without the involvement of one party to the conflict is a diplomatic hoax that undermines the chance of a genuine two-state solution.      It’s an “anti-peace” plan.,2020-01-28 17:31:14,Twitter Web App,355,1130
Glad you tuned in Mr. President.    Now that I have your attention how about coming down to the Senate to share your side of the story under penalty of perjury? https://t.co/vPRFQwbJyX,2020-01-28 16:53:22,Twitter Web App,4331,19314
75 years after the liberation of Auschwitz we remember those brutally murdered during the Holocaust.

The stench of hypocrisy. At every turn today Ken Starr contradicted his prior actions and statements from the Clinton trial and beyond. A tortured and twisted reversal. Did they really think his presentation would help the President’s case?,2020-01-27 20:11:56,Twitter Web App,101,410
GOP Senators have run out of excuses: Bolton is screaming “call me as a witness.” Willful blindness to the truth is a gross violation of their constitutional duty especially when a big part of Trump’s defense is that he didn’t withhold Ukraine aid for personal political favors. https://t.co/m4VY5SABqw,2020-01-27 00:22:07,Twitter for iPhone,2159,6474
Trump’s threats against Schiff are the latest example of his political thuggery like his witness intimidation. The Chief Justice should issue a warning to Trump’s lawyers and if the misconduct persists impose a gag order on Defendant Trump. https://t.co/ph8xfR7XhO,2020-01-26 17:40:12,Twitter for iPhone,182,546
Remember when Mulvaney says “corruption related to the DNC server” he is referring to the Putin-inspired lie to distract from Russian interference in the 2016 election. So he is saying Trump held up aid to Ukraine to get them to fuel Putin’s hoax.,2020-01-25 19:44:34,Twitter Web App,301,850
Big Problem: When the Trump team said there was no evidence of anyone who directly heard Trump call for holding up military assistance to Ukraine they must have forgotten about Mick Mulvaney—who told the entire country. Did they really forget this? https://t.co/DTHfpInXIh,2020-01-25 19:43:33,Twitter Media Studio,5495,13236
Unbelievable that—on the floor of the U.S. Senate—Trump’s lawyers gave more oxygen to the Moscow-inspired conspiracy theory that Ukraine interfered in the U.S. 2016 election. Putin is truly smiling now.,2020-01-25 17:35:43,Twitter for iPhone,120,283
If anything Trump’s counsel made the case for calling key fact witnesses close to the President like Bolton and Mulvaney.   They talked about how cross-examination of witnesses is a powerful tool for getting at the truth.  So why are they blocking them?,2020-01-25 17:15:31,Twitter Web App,578,1605
I just got out of the Senate Chamber. Tonight marks the end of the House managers’ powerful oral arguments. Here’s a recap of this week what we can expect to see next week and why we must keep pushing for my motion to have the Chief Justice decide on witnesses and documents. https://t.co/czuifz6mVc,2020-01-25 02:38:58,Twitter Media Studio,84,262
This is the same arrogance that has become the hallmark of the Trump Administration.  They hate it when people ask about Ukraine because they know they were engaged in what John Bolton called “a drug deal” and then Pompeo threw Ambassador Yovanovitch under the bus.  Shameful. https://t.co/m4rK3r1XM6,2020-01-25 00:46:29,Twitter Web App,83,217
With everything going on in the Senate it's always good to start the day in the state and share some good news. I joined with folks from Allegany and Garrett Counties at the Mountain Maryland PACE Breakfast to discuss the funding that has been secured for Western Maryland. https://t.co/b624TEbqXo,2020-01-24 17:30:13,Twitter Web App,4,32
This is important.   I requested GAO’s correspondence with the Trump Administration and as this new document reveals they BLOCKED the DOD from telling GAO what happened.   And we know from other emails that DOD was troubled about the legality of withholding aid to Ukraine. https://t.co/5tPG4qxlRe,2020-01-24 17:13:18,Twitter Web App,89,154
As Trump tears up nuclear arms control agreements conducts reckless foreign policy by tweet and exacerbates climate change—the Doomsday Clock is the closest it has been to midnight. Congress and the world must take bold action to reverse the clock. https://t.co/mbaNiIm560,2020-01-24 14:45:30,Twitter for iPhone,40,90
Jim Lehrer was a national treasure.   May he rest in peace.  His kind of commitment to fair unbiased and detailed reporting has sadly come under fire in recent times by those who want to attack the truth—and our democracy is the worse for it. https://t.co/Sm2NUZ2vhn,2020-01-24 04:01:41,Twitter for iPhone,42,192
In response to my request to investigate the withholding of aid to Ukraine GAO asked the White House and OMB for explanations. As seen in these documents OMB provided incomplete responses and the White House flat out refused. Part of the cover-up. https://t.co/Fu75zmtAyV,2020-01-24 01:01:58,Twitter Web App,127,239
Trump took the final step to gut the Clean Water Act and still hasn’t clarified his position on the enforcement of Bay TMDL. As I said in June this will put watershed states like Maryland in danger and leave millions vulnerable to polluted water. See you in court Mr. President. https://t.co/ammCbYpKDX,2020-01-23 22:06:38,Twitter Media Studio,80,212
None of this aid was withheld because Obama wanted to cheat in an election by blackmailing a foreign country. They also notified Congress of the national security justification consistent with the law. Wasn't a cover-up and they didn't break the law unlike this administration. https://t.co/iHKEExURft,2020-01-23 21:14:30,Twitter Web App,4584,13285
I reviewed the so-called “classified document” that was referenced at the trial yesterday. I see nothing “classified” about it. Hiding politically embarrassing info from public view is not grounds for classifying it. Part of the cover-up.,2020-01-23 17:59:38,Twitter Web App,865,2249
Dangerous pattern: trial is showing how Trump is trying to cheat in 2020 by pressuring Ukraine to announce a bogus investigation of Joe Biden while he is also blocking the passage of the DETER Act—my bill to punish Putin if we catch him interfering in 2020.https://t.co/fTDf4QWejn,2020-01-23 14:59:22,Twitter Web App,93,178
Day 2: We’re in our dinner break right now. If you’ve been watching the impeachment trial you've likely heard the House managers speak about the Impoundment Control Act and the independent GAO legal analysis I requested. Here's an explainer on the issue: https://t.co/D5dECb6UOu,2020-01-23 00:11:03,Twitter Media Studio,277,609
They didn’t want you to notice this but around 1:40 am last night GOP senators abandoned all pretense of impartiality.   That’s when they voted against my amendment to have the Chief Justice decide on witnesses and documents—even though he could still be overridden by a vote. https://t.co/GQOE3ruqt2,2020-01-22 14:33:53,Twitter Media Studio,402,701
The fact that every Republican senator voted against this impartial fair process is further evidence of their own determination to hide the evidence of Trump’s gross abuse of power. I will offer this motion again later in the trial. https://t.co/LcGwoZGzyx,2020-01-22 07:40:30,Twitter Media Studio,118,317
GOP senators just voted against my amendment to ensure that the Chief Justice would serve the same role in the Senate impeachment trial as a judge in any other American trial—to support efforts to get to the truth.,2020-01-22 06:49:34,Twitter Web App,261,611
No Republican senator can question the fairness of having the Chief Justice the highest-ranking American judicial official who was appointed by a Republican president make rulings about calling witnesses and requests for documents. https://t.co/xBWrghkWAr,2020-01-22 06:35:45,Twitter Web App,104,296
I just offered an amendment that directs the Chief Justice to subpoena requested witnesses and documents IF he determines they are likely to provide material evidence relevant to the articles of impeachment. https://t.co/Aeft8D4QnK,2020-01-22 06:29:47,Twitter Web App,229,807
GOP senators who voted repeatedly to close their eyes to additional evidence of Trump’s crimes against the Constitution are co-conspirators in the cover-up. https://t.co/G1nrA7aA4u,2020-01-22 01:18:40,Twitter Media Studio,183,490
It’s worth noting that many of the documents that Sen. Schumer requested tonight—from the White House State Department and OMB—would answer the same questions that the Trump Administration refused to answer for the nonpartisan GAO in an attempt to obstruct their investigation.,2020-01-22 01:05:37,Twitter for iPhone,224,620
Sen. Schumer offered an amendment to allow us to subpoena White House documents. Republicans voted against it. It’s clear they don’t want the facts to see the light of day—or reach the American people. They just became part of the cover-up.,2020-01-21 21:51:52,Twitter Web App,312,780
Just got off the Senate Floor where the President’s lawyers sounded more like they were at a Trump rally than a Senate trial.,2020-01-21 20:12:32,Twitter Web App,166,637
During the trial we won’t have access to our phones.   I’ll be providing updates during the breaks—and may be able to send a few notes to my staff.   As McConnell tries to ram through this cover-up—without witnesses and evidence—it’s key that Americans know what’s going on.,2020-01-21 17:59:09,Twitter Web App,382,1241
McConnell’s resolution makes clear he is violating his oath and working in lockstep with Trump to rig the trial—that’s why Trump’s lawyers are cheering. Today GOP senators will have their first chance to change that and vote for a fair trial with witnesses. Watch what they do. https://t.co/6G5qvJ1ytx,2020-01-21 15:29:16,Twitter Media Studio,94,210
At this moment more than any other in recent times we must follow the power of Dr. King’s example of unity inclusion peace and love. Dr. King also wanted America to face hard truths.  The Senate should follow that example—wherever the truth may lead.,2020-01-21 01:34:16,Twitter for iPhone,28,154
