We are all in debt to @marceelias and his team who are unsung heroes of this election. They have worked tirelessly for months blocking GOP efforts to prevent absentee voting stop the count and wage multiple frivolous lawsuits to try to undermine the election outcome. https://t.co/dAXmdCMUyA,2020-11-13 17:40:35,Twitter Web App,0,5
She’s worried about investments to help working families small businesses reduce student debt &amp; modernize our infrastructure but didn’t hear a peep about Trump’s $2 trillion tax giveaway to big corporations &amp; the rich.

Each day Donald Trump continues to spew false claims of fraud he is undermining our country and system of government. It is past time for my Republican colleagues to publicly recognize Joe Biden as President-elect and push Trump to do the same. Today now -- do the right thing.,2020-11-09 14:21:52,Twitter Web App,1,14

Almost there! Restoring leadership and sanity to the White House.  @JoeBiden "The purpose of our politics the work of the nation isn't to fan the flames of conflict but solve problems. To guarantee justice. To give everybody a fair shot. And to improve the lives of our people",2020-11-07 15:26:40,Twitter Web App,2,10
Despicable. Trump used White House podium tonight to spew his completely false narrative about the election and our democracy. Fact checkers searching for one truthful word in tonight's remarks...,2020-11-06 00:09:21,Twitter Web App,6,53
Always their plan -- never thought they'd actually say it out loud. https://t.co/11NyjZMlzQ,2020-11-05 23:31:24,Twitter Web App,3,11
GOP senators are still cowering before Trump. It’s long past time they stand up for our democracy and call upon Trump to stop his fraudulent attacks on counting the ballots.,2020-11-05 17:36:56,Twitter Web App,2,40
I am confident that when all the votes in the battleground states are counted Joe Biden will be our next president and Kamala Harris our next vice-president.

Joe Biden earlier today: "I'm going to fight to protect your healthcare just like I fight to protect my own family".  This simple statement says everything about the choice in this election.,2020-10-28 18:38:43,Twitter Web App,1,9
I agree. The Electoral College has become a completely undemocratic system for electing our president. https://t.co/xOXKplyWgk,2020-10-27 17:56:02,Twitter Web App,2,14

Make no mistake.  McConnell and his big money donors don't want another penny to go to help struggling Americans.    As President Joe Biden will focus on lifting up working families hardest hit by the COVID recession and addressing structural inequality. https://t.co/iSIMgPAdvi,2020-10-21 16:09:42,Twitter Web App,1,7
In other words: the new Debate Commission rules will permit 11 minutes of 'open' un-regulated time during each 15 minute segment.  Does anyone believe Trump won't repeat the same disruptive ranting performance of repetitive lies that he engaged in the first time?,2020-10-20 02:28:29,Twitter Web App,3,1
