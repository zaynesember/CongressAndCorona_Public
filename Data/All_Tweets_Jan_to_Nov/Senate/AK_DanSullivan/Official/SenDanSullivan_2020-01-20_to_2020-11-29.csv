@HHS_ASH Alaska leads the nation in per capita tests. This allocation will build on that success &amp; expand capacity further.

This weekend I met with Alaskans across a spectrum of industries—including tourism &amp; fishing—whose livelihoods are at risk due to the #COVID19 pandemic.

The pandemic has diverted time resources and focus from regular tasks so I believe an application extension is warranted. Without an extension the very goal of expanding high speed broadband will be defeated and we can’t let that happen. [3/3] #ConnectTribes,2020-07-23 23:16:49,TweetDeck,5,9
Today alongside other House &amp; Senate Republicans I sent a letter to @FCC Chairman Pai asking for a deadline extension to the 2.5 GHz Rural Tribal Priority Window which is closing soon and could reduce the #broadband disparity.

Today I voted with 85 of my Senate colleagues to pass a strong #FY21NDAA that authorizes $740.5 billion in critical defense spending and furthers our four-year effort to rebuild America’s military and restore our military’s readiness following the devastating Obama-era cuts. https://t.co/r6t0m7wa55,2020-07-23 22:05:27,TweetDeck,2332,9375

The Sanders amendment – which Sen. Chuck Schumer supports – is the first salvo in the goal of defunding the military. Sanders says so in his @Politico op-ed “Defund the Pentagon: The Liberal Case.”   I applaud my colleagues for overwhelmingly defeating this #FY21NDAA amendment. https://t.co/6PXc02GfMn,2020-07-22 21:07:00,Twitter Web App,3,8
The good news? Congress &amp; the @WhiteHouse under Republican leadership with bipartisan support particularly on the Armed Services Committee got to work. We can’t undo this progress by slashing defense funding now. #FY21NDAA @SASCMajority https://t.co/2vfFav8rHU,2020-07-22 21:01:35,Twitter Web App,7,16
Another cautionary example: In early 1950s the greatest military power in the world due to dramatic defense cuts &amp; reduction in training had difficulty halting the invasion of a Third World army in Korea.   We need to heed this lesson. “No more Task Force Smith.”  #FY21NDAA https://t.co/AJlkGON4M8,2020-07-22 20:59:37,Twitter Web App,0,2
Sen. Bernie Sanders offered an #NDAA amendment today to slash defense spending by 10-14%.   How would that affect military readiness?   Consider: Newly declassified report shows that after the 25% cuts during the Obama years just 5% of the @USArmy was fully ready to fight. https://t.co/KooKXpPsCq,2020-07-22 20:56:08,Twitter Web App,5,16

@CDCgov @DHSgov @StateDept @lisamurkowski A few additional points: First according to @CDCgov across the globe many more people have died from the flu this season than from the #coronavirus. However the coronavirus appears more contagious than the flu likely spreading when a patient is not symptomatic. [6/11],2020-02-26 16:31:15,Twitter Web App,5,10

@SecElaineChao The Port of Alaska is the only @DeptofDefense strategic seaport near the #Arctic—a fact we cannot overlook as sea ice recedes traffic accelerates and our country’s adversaries particularly Russia grow their maritime capabilities in the region.,2020-02-11 19:48:40,TweetDeck,1,3
@SecElaineChao The Port of Alaska not only serves the most basic needs of a broad swath of Alaskans – including fuel food construction materials and other goods – but also America’s security interests as an #Arctic nation.,2020-02-11 19:47:45,TweetDeck,3,3
This morning @SecElaineChao announced a $20 million Port Infrastructure Development Program (PIDP) grant for the Port of Alaska in Anchorage a grant I’ve been pressing for along with the Municipality for months.  ➡️ https://t.co/QqBod9kK2o,2020-02-11 19:46:57,TweetDeck,5,20
I have reintroduced my bill the “Protect Our Heroes Act” which would enhance federal penalties including opening up the potential for the death penalty for criminals who ambush lure or target law enforcement officers. ➡️ https://t.co/116FuMjrN8,2020-02-10 21:00:58,TweetDeck,4,14

Two police officers were shot in New York City on Sunday in an attack that the NYPD commissioner called “a premeditated assassination attempt.” The disgraceful attack underscores a troubling rise in recent years in the disrespect &amp; violence directed at America’s police force. https://t.co/wSmfw9Ogjd,2020-02-10 20:58:23,Twitter Web App,4,18
Nothing fires me up quite like Senate Dems who represent states that've already degraded their environments with irresponsible development telling Alaskans how to manage our pristine environment &amp; seeking to further impoverish some of our poorest citizens.

Connie like her husband was fearlessly optimistic about the future and put her heart and soul into bringing opportunity and development to the Interior. Our thoughts and prayers are with Bernie and their family today as we mourn the loss of this incredible woman.,2020-02-05 17:23:30,TweetDeck,1,4
Julie &amp; I were heartbroken to learn of the passing of Connie Karl a friend and a great Alaskan who passed yesterday after a battle with ALS.

Tonight @POTUS @realDonaldTrump delivered a strong #StateoftheUnion an optimistic speech—optimism that is based on real results that we're seeing in America and Alaska. #sotu #sotu2020 https://t.co/4mgxkOf1gj,2020-02-05 05:08:52,Twitter Media Studio,31,124
Matt puts a face on an industry that provides tens of thousands of jobs in Alaska. The work he does is one of the reasons I get to brag that Alaska is the Superpower of Seafood. #SOTU,2020-02-05 01:46:28,TweetDeck,4,9
I look forward to bringing fellow Alaskans to D.C. to witness the President’s annual #StateoftheUnion. My guest this evening is Matt Alward of Homer a proud fisherman and president of the United Fishermen of Alaska. #SOTU https://t.co/Hx2OKBxZje,2020-02-05 01:46:05,TweetDeck,23,110
@lisamurkowski @repdonyoung @NativeFed Thanks to the @NativeFed team &amp; Julie Kitka for bringing everyone together—tribal leaders high-level military officials representatives from the private sector and senior Trump administration officials including Alaska’s-own @ASIndianAffairs—for such a critical conversation. https://t.co/TuRBDCAZl3,2020-02-04 17:21:11,TweetDeck,1,2
@lisamurkowski @repdonyoung @NativeFed We covered a number of topics including Missing &amp; Murdered Indigenous Women initiatives and the dire need for increased public safety support in rural Alaska. My wife Julie offered an insightful presentation on the challenges of youth homelessness and sex trafficking. #MMIW https://t.co/nKo7J11j0j,2020-02-04 17:18:16,TweetDeck,1,6

These patriotic individuals did their jobs admirably and no doubt provided a level of comfort to their fellow citizens embroiled in an unsettling situation. #coronavirus,2020-02-04 15:38:58,TweetDeck,2,5
I want to commend the numerous Alaskans including medical professions and first responders who offered help last week for the American evacuees from Wuhan who stopped over at the Anchorage airport on their journey to the Lower 48. #coronavirus,2020-02-04 15:38:31,TweetDeck,2,4
To address one particular question I’ve received: All upcoming cargo flights between Wuhan and Alaska have been canceled and many commercial airlines have suspended passenger flights between the U.S. and China. #coronavirus,2020-02-04 15:37:37,TweetDeck,2,2
@SecAzar Last week Secretary Azar declared a public health emergency. @WHO has classified the outbreak as a global health emergency. @StateDept has issued an alert advising Americans to not travel to China. #coronavirus,2020-02-04 15:37:05,TweetDeck,2,3
As we see the number of cases of the novel coronavirus increase I encourage Alaskans to remain calm but very vigilant. Health &amp; Human Services @SecAzar recently said “The risk to Americans remains low and we are working to keep it that way.” https://t.co/vk2I87socr,2020-02-04 15:34:46,Twitter Web App,5,9

@SenFeinstein @lisamurkowski Our hope is that when Americans know that this crisis exists in our communities and our neighborhoods good citizens across the country will recognize the signs and help vulnerable adults and children escape the clutches of a trafficker. #HumanTrafficking,2020-01-30 16:03:13,TweetDeck,1,10

It’s sickening to know that thousands of individuals in our own country are ensnared in what amounts to a form of slavery. We need to do all we can to stop it. One of the best weapons we have against human trafficking is exposure &amp; sunlight. #HumanTraffickingAwarenessMonth,2020-01-30 16:00:45,TweetDeck,9,21

@WSJ @GoldmanSachs “Goldman executives are simply looking to curry political favor with powerful green interests.

Harry Brower Jr. mayor of Alaska’s North Slope Borough penned a must-read op-ed in @WSJ this weekend rebuking @GoldmanSachs for choosing to divest of all oil &amp; gas development in the #Arctic without consulting him or his constituents the very people who will be most impacted. https://t.co/KxD4TqUfUt,2020-01-28 21:01:55,Twitter Web App,14,22
Many Alaskans have reached out in recent days with concerns about the reported cases in the U.S. of a new coronavirus which are all connected back to Wuhan China.
