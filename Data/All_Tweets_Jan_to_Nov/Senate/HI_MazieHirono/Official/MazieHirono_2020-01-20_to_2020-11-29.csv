The President’s lawyer claimed the President “is a man of his word.” But we know @realDonaldTrump has lied 16000 times. How can you give credence to somebody who says a whopper like that? Yet Republicans are voting down the line to protect this out of control lawless President. https://t.co/bn0lDybuf2,2020-01-22 14:10:13,Twitter Media Studio,410,1445
If @realDonaldTrump is allowed to get away with what he did who is he going to shake down next? Who is he going to bribe next to do his political dirty work? https://t.co/DzwGgGJj8i,2020-01-21 21:51:02,Twitter Media Studio,336,1199
Mitch McConnell and @realDonaldTrump are totally on the same page about using the impeachment trial as a coverup. Any Republican who goes along with the McConnell resolution is complicit. The American people demand a fair trial. https://t.co/5kMmYd1NHz,2020-01-21 17:05:11,Twitter Media Studio,412,1258
10 years ago the Supreme Court allowed special interests to flood our elections and silence our voices. Corporations shouldn’t have more power than every day Americans in our democracy. It’s time to #EndCitizensUnited and put the power back in the hands of the American people.,2020-01-21 16:36:53,TweetDeck,215,710

Republicans are going on and on about how there was no due process. Instead of letting Mitch McConnell whitewash the impeachment process why don’t we do the American people a service and actually have a fair trial. https://t.co/nniICz4ks7,2020-01-20 02:55:58,Twitter Media Studio,347,1516
