Those of us in Delaware could not be prouder to send one of our own to the White House. But my friend @JoeBiden never thought that this campaign was about him. It was and always has been about the soul of America.  His compassion and decency will unite our country.,2020-11-07 18:03:08,Twitter for iPhone,1,12
We will prioritize environmental justice.  We will fight for an economy that works for every American.  We will welcome strangers to our land and celebrate diversity.  We will restore our system of checks and balances.  We will protect the quality affordable health care.,2020-11-07 18:02:44,Twitter for iPhone,1,9

Instead of taking action to address the climate crisis Donald Trump and his EPA have been: ❌ Denying the facts. ❌ Rolling back critical protections for clean air and clean water. ❌ Censoring scientists and experts and suppressing their research. https://t.co/otRAmDMoK3,2020-10-23 02:25:20,Twitter Web App,1,3

Right now in the midst of a public health crisis we need a leader in the White House who can communicate a clear strategy to mitigate the spread of #COVID19 and protect our communities. And we need someone who listens to health experts.  @JoeBiden would do both. https://t.co/LoJaV0WNra,2020-03-10 19:19:41,Twitter for iPhone,1,4
Here in Monroe Michigan with #TeamJoe to support @Teamsters Local 337 push for strong workers rights and working conditions for all Americans.    As President @JoeBiden will always put hardworking families first. https://t.co/oQl09IW3oH,2020-03-08 19:52:05,Twitter for iPhone,4,20
It’s a lovely day here in Detroit for a canvass kickoff with @58_ibew! @JoeBiden knows that the men and women in this room and those before them helped build the middle class. As President he will never stop fighting for them. #TeamJoe https://t.co/DBX0kKJo0j,2020-03-08 18:24:40,Twitter for iPhone,6,15

The progressive inclusive movement that my friend @JoeBiden is leading is the real deal. And — together — it’s how we’re going to beat Donald Trump in November!  https://t.co/wxzqY18Y6U,2020-03-04 15:09:34,Twitter for iPhone,4,9

Delmarva knows @JoeBiden — and just delivered a huge win!   Excited to see such a strong Super Tuesday start for #TeamJoe but I know the #JoeMentum is only just beginning. https://t.co/RVvHiK0K5I,2020-03-04 00:35:30,Twitter for iPhone,2,5
Last night in Dallas 3 of @JoeBiden’s former rivals came together to support him.   That’s the thing about Joe— he brings folks together.  He’s the person we need to defeat Donald Trump and mend the divisions in our country.

Time and time again life has tried to knock my friend @JoeBiden down and he has always come back stronger.   Never count him out. Tonight is just beginning. And I couldn’t be prouder to be a part of #TeamJoe. https://t.co/jcRjpKUL5D,2020-03-01 01:03:05,Twitter for iPhone,5,12
I was lucky enough to be in South Carolina last weekend. This is what I heard constantly - not just from supporters at @JoeBiden events but from people who passed me on the street.  Joe's ability to genuinely connect with folks from all walks of life is what our country needs. https://t.co/LAsgRlZqVA,2020-02-26 19:18:56,Twitter for iPhone,4,11
Yesterday Martha and I hopped on the “Soul of the Nation” bus and traveled down the eastern coast of South Carolina telling folks why we’re proud to be on #TeamJoe. With 6 days to go before S.C.’s #PrimaryDay the energy on the ground is electric! https://t.co/AEEgekDOUX,2020-02-23 15:57:05,Twitter for iPhone,2,9
.@JoeBiden recognized #climatechange was an existential crisis decades ago — long before it was “cool.” He knows it’s going to take strong steady leadership on the global stage to confront this challenge save our planet and make sure no community is left behind in the process.,2020-02-20 03:31:18,Twitter for iPhone,0,3
My friend @JoeBiden is right. While other candidates argue about forgetting a name Joe is the only person on stage who has crafted — and implemented — a plan that combats violence fights corruption and bolsters economic opportunity in Central America. Experience matters.,2020-02-20 03:05:02,Twitter for iPhone,32,76
If we can’t be in the First State there’s no place I’d rather be than @LisaBRochester’s birthday party surrounded by all those who share my view: she’s dynamite! Delaware is lucky to call her ours. https://t.co/VJfdKALQ3k,2020-02-12 01:44:02,Twitter for iPhone,1,15
