Judge Barrett may be confirmed but let history show that I have tried hard both to follow the Golden Rule and the example of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and that I refused to join the majority opinion.

That's why @SenateDems' request is simple: "All we're asking is that we come together - across party lines with the White House - and support our state and local governments...so we can continue to fight this pandemic and mitigate the economic harm that is ravaging our country.",2020-08-04 21:56:55,Twitter Web App,3,8

And the economic impact of these cuts don't stay within a single state's borders. They create a ripple effect across the broader economy undercutting efforts to reduce unemployment and get our country on a path to economic recovery.  It's why we must act now.,2020-08-04 21:30:21,Twitter Web App,3,4

The absurdity doesn't end there. Justin Walker believes the courts should invalidate the #ACA.   So during a pandemic Senate Republicans' priority is confirming a judge who wants to get rid of our nation's health care law on which millions rely for quality affordable care.,2020-06-18 19:57:54,Twitter Web App,5,15
.@senatemajldr sets the agenda for the Senate.

#DREAMers can breathe a sigh of relief today.  #SCOTUS rightly rejects @realDonaldTrump’s cruel attempt to end protections for nearly 800000 #DREAMers in Delaware and across the U.S.  This ruling is a win but our fight continues to make DACA protections permanent. https://t.co/6tmq5CqZPO,2020-06-18 14:46:40,Twitter Web App,35,130

And while @realDonaldTrump has invoked the Defense Production Act he still has yet to fully use its authority to get much-needed supplies to states facing shortages while they struggle to contain this pandemic,2020-03-20 16:33:05,Twitter Web App,5,9
Our hospitals do not have enough live-saving supplies: hospital gowns swabs for testing gloves surgical masks and ventilators. For the safety of doctors and nurses for the safety of patients and for the safety of those who are healthy they need these supplies immediately,2020-03-20 16:33:05,Twitter Web App,2,4
We are facing an unprecedented public health crisis that has been met with an entirely inadequate response from the Trump Administration. Asking our nation’s health care workers to treat #COVID19 patients without even basic protective gear is absolutely unacceptable,2020-03-20 16:33:05,Twitter Web App,2,3
In short #DPA allows the federal government during extreme situations to direct private companies to meet the needs of our national defense. Today that would mean boosting the production of supplies that our health care workers desperately need during the #COVID19 outbreak,2020-03-20 16:33:04,Twitter Web App,3,4

Today I visited my alma mater the @UDelaware to discuss how we in Congress are working to address the greatest threat to our planet – #climatechange.   These Blue Hens are the leaders of tomorrow and they know the time to fight climate change for future generations is now. https://t.co/pgSl4ytCTo,2020-02-18 16:29:50,Twitter for iPhone,9,28
These cuts come at a time when millions of Americans living with pre-existing conditions could lose their health care as a result of @realDonaldTrump’s reckless lawsuit to repeal the ACA in its entirety. That's why I'm proud to stand with @SenateDems and fight to #ProtectOurCare.,2020-02-13 22:24:09,Twitter Web App,14,20
Here's what @realDonaldTrump's budget proposal looks like for @HHSGov: - Cut more than $40 billion in programs aimed at helping working class families older and disabled Americans - Cut $2.6 billion to @NIH - Cut $900 billion to Medicaid over 10 years https://t.co/o0JwkezsJJ,2020-02-13 22:24:08,Twitter Web App,18,24
Washington D.C. is more than government offices and national monuments. It's home to more than 700000 people who built their lives here.  For years @EleanorNorton has been a tireless advocate for them and #DCStatehood and I couldn't be prouder to be her partner in the Senate. https://t.co/0nxkqTGpoZ,2020-02-13 20:20:26,Twitter Web App,15,38
As we approach the 50th anniversary of the EPA and @EPA proudly touts its "progress for a stronger future" President Trump has again proposed to slash the agency's budget by almost a third.  I would hardly call that "progress for a stronger future." https://t.co/AkLybYuy28,2020-02-13 17:05:00,TweetDeck,10,9
For years I've brought attention to the fact that Delaware sits at the end of America's Tailpipe—that we need cooperation from upwind states and EPA to meet air quality standards.   This report is further proof. https://t.co/KD4WaQ5Er7,2020-02-13 16:37:32,Twitter Web App,4,21
It's imperative that the federal government adopt an all-hands-on-deck approach to tackle the #CoronarivusOutbreak.  That's why today I asked experts at @NSAGov @HHSGov and @GAO about the lessons US agencies and our foreign counterparts learned from past global health threats. https://t.co/9tMgOwcFu7,2020-02-12 21:24:54,Twitter Web App,9,21
I'm heading down to the Senate floor to talk about the #CleanEconomy Act which would empower EPA to use the authorities and tools already at its disposal to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by no later than mid-century.

@SenatorDurbin @SenatorMenendez @SenatorCardin @SenBlumenthal @ChrisVanHollen @SenTinaSmith The #CleanEconomy Act will put the U.S. on a path to once again lead the world in the fight against climate change while lifting up American communities and workers.  It’s our message to the rest of the world: America will once against lead the fight against the climate crisis. https://t.co/rXpO4FRWha,2020-02-11 20:02:35,Twitter Web App,14,23
@SenatorDurbin @SenatorMenendez @SenatorCardin @SenBlumenthal @ChrisVanHollen @SenTinaSmith Finally the #CleanEconomy Act compels EPA to use American workers domestic materials and strong labor standards to get the job done – using our country’s talents to make the transition to net-zero emissions.,2020-02-11 19:56:07,Twitter Web App,6,11
@SenatorDurbin @SenatorMenendez @SenatorCardin @SenBlumenthal @ChrisVanHollen @SenTinaSmith The #CleanEconomy Act directs EPA to prioritize input from and investments in economically distressed and vulnerable communities who are most impacted by climate change and the pollution that causes it.,2020-02-11 19:54:30,Twitter Web App,6,14
@SenatorDurbin @SenatorMenendez @SenatorCardin @SenBlumenthal @ChrisVanHollen @SenTinaSmith Under the #CleanEconomy Act EPA must develop and then implement a national plan that would maximize emissions reductions minimize costs to consumers and provide flexibility to industry.,2020-02-11 19:52:15,Twitter Web App,4,13
@SenatorDurbin @SenatorMenendez @SenatorCardin @SenBlumenthal @ChrisVanHollen @SenTinaSmith (2/2) The #CleanEconomy Act would provide clear direction from Congress and empower EPA using the tools already at their disposal to reduce the emissions that fuel climate change.,2020-02-11 19:49:12,Twitter Web App,7,14
@SenatorDurbin @SenatorMenendez @SenatorCardin @SenBlumenthal @ChrisVanHollen @SenTinaSmith The #CleanEconomy Act would reach that goal here in the United States. Here’s how (1/2): EPA already has the authority and tools to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But under the Trump Administration EPA's policies have been used to increase – not reduce – harmful emissions.,2020-02-11 19:48:05,Twitter Web App,14,19
@SenatorDurbin @SenatorMenendez @SenatorCardin @SenBlumenthal @ChrisVanHollen @SenTinaSmith The world’s leading scientists have warned us that we need to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius in order to avoid the most catastrophic impacts of climate change. To do that we would need to collectively reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero by mid-century.,2020-02-11 19:46:33,Twitter Web App,13,24
@SenatorDurbin @SenatorMenendez @SenatorCardin @SenBlumenthal @ChrisVanHollen @SenTinaSmith Just last week Antarctica reached 65 degrees Fahrenheit.

Today 32 of my Senate colleagues and I are introducing the #CleanEconomy Act legislation that would put the U.S. on a path to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by no later than 2050 while also empowering American workers and uplifting our most vulnerable communities.,2020-02-11 15:29:39,Twitter Web App,14,26

The fact is EPA's PFAS Action Plan is mostly plan and very little action. That's unacceptable. It's not enough for EPA to set more aspirational deadlines and engage in endless delay while more states and communities struggle. https://t.co/je3CoufeyR,2020-02-10 16:03:50,Twitter Web App,5,8

Enough with the feigned outrage. You know what’s offensive? Every time @realDonaldTrump cozies up to military families for political gain.
