Americans urgently need cash to meet immediate needs that’s been my goal from the start. The current bill has promise but it shouldn’t give lower earners smaller checks —that’s directly contrary to my proposal. We need to fix this to ensure lower earners get equal payments.,2020-03-20 00:51:42,Twitter Web App,8572,50707
This is good news. I echo the Administration’s request that Michael White and all Americans wrongfully detained by Iran are immediately released. Let’s bring them home. https://t.co/UOkbsn84S6,2020-03-19 17:48:47,Twitter Web App,22,160
Whether it's our proposal or something else we need to act now. Today’s @USDOL weekly report showed jobless claims rose to 281k last week and this number is only expected to go up. This means Unemployment Insurance will be vital for families in the months to come.,2020-03-19 17:03:13,Twitter Web App,40,224
This needs to be in addition to the direct resources we send to families. I introduced the bipartisan Coronavirus Worker Relief Act with several of my Senate colleagues last week to expand access to the Disaster Unemployment Assistance program. https://t.co/7gs0Vy9IZw,2020-03-19 17:03:13,Twitter Web App,39,258
With the economy shutdown due to #COVID19 we must immediately strengthen our Unemployment Insurance system. That means extending how many weeks one can receive benefits and broadening the eligibility to include furloughed workers the self-employed and independent contractors.,2020-03-19 17:03:12,Twitter Web App,449,2678
Appreciative of the over 150 Utah mayors &amp; commissioners who spoke with me yesterday so I could get a better sense of the needs of Utahns &amp; local businesses in this time.

Congress is going to get help to the people who need it. We’re going to get help to American families and workers. We’re going to get help to businesses that have been dramatically impacted.

China uses its Belt and Road Initiative to invest in global mineral production leaving developing countries beholden to the CCP.

Threats to our cybersecurity are a direct threat to our national security. It's concerning that the budget for @CISAgov proposes significant cuts.

It’s been 20 days since we raised this exact concern to @FDATobacco Director Zeller. Flavored e-cigarettes are still on the market addicting our kids to nicotine.
