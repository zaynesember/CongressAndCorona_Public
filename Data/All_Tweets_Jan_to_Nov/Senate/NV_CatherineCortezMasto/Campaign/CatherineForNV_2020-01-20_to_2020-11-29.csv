If we’re going to end Mitch McConnell’s stranglehold on the Senate - &amp; give @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris a Senate they can actually work with then we must #FliptheSenate.   The only way we can do that is by electing @ReverendWarnock @ossoff in GA on Jan. 5th ➡️https://t.co/4txy6kLmKl https://t.co/kHKTqxjuM4,2020-11-15 16:54:03,Twitter for iPhone,46,122
To be clear: Ads are not the issue. The organic disinformation &amp; misinformation running rampant on @Facebook’s platform is the problem.   Now this ads ban makes it harder to educate voters about the #GASen runoffs. https://t.co/kOq1PG8QI3,2020-11-12 01:01:45,Twitter for iPhone,28,73

That’s right. So many things we care about - and the progress we’re able to make on those ideals - hinges on democrats flipping the Senate in November.   Looking forward to our conversation President @BarackObama! #FlipTheSenate https://t.co/3RZawTiiqp,2020-10-16 17:37:17,Twitter for iPhone,23,64

Donald Trump is ramming through a Supreme Court nominee who will help him repeal the Affordable Care Act taking coverage away from millions of Americans in the middle of a pandemic.

.@BarbaraBollier is polling neck &amp; neck with her GOP opponent in #kssen race. And just last week Mitch McConnell's dark money super PAC dumped $7.2 million worth in ads attacking her. Why?

Higher than ever @ChrisMurphyCT. I’m in.   Texas deserves a Senator who will fight for Texas families. They deserve a Senator who will listen to them.

The men and women in uniform who sacrifice to serve our country are American heroes. They deserve our greatest respect - as do their families.

I'm proud to serve as Nevada's first woman in the US Senate &amp; first Latina ever. This #WomensEqualityDay we know that the fight for equality continues.

Joined my friends @CheriBustos @TomPerez today to discuss the hard work our teams @dscc @dccc @DNC are doing to help fight back against voter suppression &amp; ensure every eligible voter can access the ballot this fall. And access the ballot safely &amp; securely.   Take a look ⬇️⬇️⬇️ https://t.co/gtA0wH9Vzm,2020-08-18 23:11:18,Twitter for iPhone,2,3
@dccc @CheriBustos @TomPerez @dscc @DNC Last night at the #DemConvention I made it clear that with Donald Trump &amp; Mitch McConnell out of power Dems will expand access to the ballot &amp; protect voting rights. But we must ensure in this election that anyone who’s eligible to vote can do so safely &amp; without barriers.,2020-08-18 20:06:29,Twitter Web App,5,14
@dccc @TomPerez @CheriBustos @dscc @DNC We're committed to expanding early vote for Americans. In NC we took on the GOP to protect the state’s early vote program so North Carolinians can vote the Saturday before Election Day - &amp; won. We cannot allow anyone to make it harder for eligible voters to cast their ballots.,2020-08-18 19:43:13,Twitter Web App,2,3
@dccc @CheriBustos @TomPerez @dscc @DNC .@CheriBustos @TomPerez &amp; I have been working to protect the integrity of our elections. In GA we sued over the state's absentee ballot procedures b/c when those ballots are unfairly rejected voters are disenfranchised. We must ensure procedures to count those ballots are fair.,2020-08-18 19:31:05,Twitter Web App,2,5
Mr. President: Nevada is not intimidated by you. America is not intimidated by you. We will send @JoeBiden to the WH &amp; #FlipTheSenate   Trump &amp; McConnell know how to divide but we know how to stand together. But to do it we need you on our side &gt;&gt; https://t.co/4txy6kLmKl,2020-08-18 03:30:09,Twitter Web App,20,56
This fall some will vote in a voting booth with a mask on while many will choose to vote by mail. NV took the advice of scientists &amp; medical experts - &amp; listened to Nevadans - to put in place a vote by mail system. But Donald Trump seeks to divide us by undermining that right. https://t.co/IXWsaMV0j7,2020-08-18 03:25:23,Twitter Web App,78,254

NV did the right thing &amp; expanded access to vote-by-mail. @realDonaldTrump has since attacked my state with outright lies &amp; a meritless lawsuit.

It’s unacceptable @USPS has to warn Americans their ballots may not be counted if they vote by mail.
