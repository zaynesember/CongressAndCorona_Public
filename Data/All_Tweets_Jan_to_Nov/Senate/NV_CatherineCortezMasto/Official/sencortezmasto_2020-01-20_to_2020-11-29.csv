It’s 2020 &amp; #AAPI women still don’t have pay equity. AAPI women earn just 90¢ for every $ their white male colleagues make.

This is one of the reasons NV is the #InnovationState! From our universities to our tourism industry we are committed to investing in the future of innovative tech. I’m so glad my staff attended the ribbon cutting for the new Black Fire Innovation hub. https://t.co/nD66XXneYn,2020-01-25 18:43:51,Twitter for iPhone,3,19
I’ll also keep fighting to prevent the CFPB from carving out an exception for debt collection companies to barrage consumers with texts and emails in addition to robocalls. Consumers shouldn't fear being taken advantage of by fraudulent telemarketers and robocallers.,2020-01-25 15:42:38,Twitter for iPhone,3,21
Nevadans received over 560 million robocalls last year with scammers making up more than 45% of those calls.   It's time to put an end to spam calls. I'm trying to do just that by passing the #TRACEDAct &amp; working to pass my #DoNotCallAct in the Senate ➡️ https://t.co/wkUDnyO7M3,2020-01-25 15:41:09,Twitter for iPhone,6,48
This administration’s #CleanWaterAct rule rolls back decades of water protections reaching beyond the repealed 2015 #CleanWaterRule and putting Nevada’s—and our nation’s—waterways at risk.  https://t.co/Waqv9Llh6z,2020-01-25 04:32:33,Twitter for iPhone,6,21
The new #WOTUS rule is bad news plain &amp; simple. It removes protections for up to 89% of NV streams because they flow only part of the year.  Our water land &amp; wildlife are entrusted to us for future generations &amp; I’m going to work to ensure they're safeguarded for that future. https://t.co/HGRsvSMjZV,2020-01-24 19:39:07,Twitter Web App,11,53
Next Monday on #Auschwitz75 is #InternationalHolocaustRemembranceDay—a day to commemorate the horrors of the Holocaust &amp; those who lost their lives.  I encourage you to follow @AuschwitzMuseum ahead of this solemn day to educate yourself on the history of this horrific tragedy. https://t.co/Y9E62QGqcr,2020-01-24 18:04:38,Twitter Web App,248,641
Given heightened regional tensions strain on counter-ISIS ops &amp; lack of clarity on how our mission connects to the Trump admin's strategic aims @SenatorRomney &amp; I are asking @DeptofDefense for more info on the mission of US troops deployed in Syria ➡️ https://t.co/s4M1fH07a5,2020-01-24 17:10:43,Twitter Web App,7,19
This admin needs to get serious about rooting out corruption and it can start by supporting my bill to make sure we know who is donating to inaugural committees and how that money is spent ➡️ https://t.co/EImcJHdLze,2020-01-24 16:09:19,Twitter Web App,4,10
Presidential inaugurations should be opportunities for the American people to celebrate the successes of our democracy not convenient fronts for big corporations and dark money donors to funnel money into the pockets of the President’s family and friends.,2020-01-24 16:08:38,Twitter Web App,5,13
President Trump’s inaugural committee allegedly spent over $1 million—far above market rates—to book a barely-used ballroom and accompanying catering services at the Trump Hotel during the President’s 2017 inauguration.   This is clearly egregious.,2020-01-24 16:08:24,Twitter Web App,16,52
.@SenJackyRosen @SenatorRisch &amp; I have a new bill to ease this burden on small business owners. Our bill will help small businesses negotiate cheaper prices &amp; provide them with resources to grow their businesses &amp; keep their customers’ data safe ➡️ https://t.co/7rTgS2J1LR,2020-01-24 15:20:40,Twitter Web App,4,12
The number of cyber-attacks &amp; data breaches has risen dramatically in recent years. Small businesses don’t have the resources to purchase pricey sophisticated products &amp; often bear the brunt of these attacks that leave their customers at risk,2020-01-24 15:19:03,Twitter Web App,9,23
@realDonaldTrump Pres Trump’s comments should concern us all—especially when his proposed budgets have already entailed cuts to these programs. Seniors deserve to have peace of mind that their lifelines won’t be cut to pay for a presidential tax cut for the wealthiest Americans&amp;big corporations.,2020-01-23 23:52:38,Twitter Web App,9,22
.@realDonaldTrump may be trying to walk these comments back now but just yesterday he said he'd easily break his campaign promise&amp; slash programs like Medicare Medicaid&amp; Social Security. This would threaten the health&amp; incomes of millions of Americans. https://t.co/2POlUAWwEl,2020-01-23 23:51:12,Twitter Web App,45,58

@CFPB I led a letter with @SenSherrodBrown calling on the Inspector General of @federalreserve to open an investigation into consumer fraud cases where Kraninger provided no or inadequate restitution to harmed consumers ➡️ https://t.co/Fij0tYscRH,2020-01-22 22:35:33,Twitter Web App,5,17
When companies rip Americans off the @CFPB should make sure consumers get their money back but under Trump’s CFPB Director Kathy Kraninger that’s not happening.,2020-01-22 22:34:38,Twitter Web App,13,27
More than 45 years after #RoevWade far too many women are facing burdensome barriers to reproductive health care. And while I’m proud that NV is rejecting these restrictive trends we must stop Republicans’ assault on access to abortion &amp; reproductive health care.,2020-01-22 16:56:50,Twitter Web App,19,66
The only way we can strengthen faith in our institutions is by passing legislation to improve transparency access&amp; integrity at the ballot box. It's time for Sen McConnell to end his blockade&amp; bring up key legislation to secure our elections for a vote ➡️ https://t.co/PV3R7vOukq,2020-01-22 15:47:57,Twitter Web App,9,18
Congress has a duty to proactively block nefarious attempts to influence our elections &amp; undermine the right to vote. Foreign entities &amp; dark $ have no place in our democracy &amp; it’s unconscionable that Sen McConnell refuses to take action to protect the integrity of our elections,2020-01-22 15:46:55,Twitter Web App,15,57
10 years ago #CitizensUnited ruling was issued opening the floodgates for big $ in politics by allowing business &amp; special interests to buy influence in elections.   We need to #EndCitizensUnited &amp; ensure our gov't represents the will of all Americans not just the wealthy few.,2020-01-21 21:57:48,Twitter Web App,24,82

Nevada is stronger when our students know they can contribute to their communities in a meaningful way.

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. is an American hero. He showed us that all struggles for justice are interconnected—that racism violence and hatred go hand-in-hand and that the strongest remedy for them lies in a love that challenges division and bigotry. #MLKDay https://t.co/qZnRb3vOW8,2020-01-20 16:01:32,Twitter for iPhone,14,63
