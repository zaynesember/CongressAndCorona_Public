My piece in the @hartfordcourant this morning on what we can all do to keep locally owned small businesses alive through a tough winter. https://t.co/gHtygKvTd2,2020-11-28 17:42:23,Twitter for iPhone,87,427
Important to recall that from a security standpoint the Soleimani killing backfired.   Iran supercharged their nuclear research increased attacks on our troops and maintained support for proxies (Hezbollah briefly took over the Lebanese gov in 2020!). https://t.co/kY4yg1xORf,2020-11-28 01:21:54,Twitter Web App,280,902
If the primary purpose of the killing of Mr. Fakhrizadeh was to make it harder to restart the Iran nuclear agreement then this assassination does not make America Israel or the world safer.,2020-11-27 18:58:16,Twitter for iPhone,2394,11811
I have not yet been briefed on this incident but: Every time America or an ally assassinates a foreign leader outside a declaration of war we normalize the tactic as a tool of statecraft. The risk is that the security benefit can be very short lived.  https://t.co/vn3mbEWmhB,2020-11-27 18:54:12,Twitter for iPhone,338,1532

Advocating for women’s rights in Saudi Arabia is now considered terrorism.  The Biden Administration must reset our relationship with Saudi Arabia. America cannot be a credible human rights voice if we keep looking the other way.  https://t.co/XqD90YgP94,2020-11-26 13:28:21,Twitter for iPhone,747,3128
I know it’s been a difficult year but it’s during the trying times that it’s most important to count and appreciate our blessings.  Happy Thanksgiving everyone! Be safe today.,2020-11-26 13:20:02,Twitter for iPhone,188,2792
The most corrupt Administration in our nation’s history. And it’s not close. 56 more days of this garbage. https://t.co/Gy5ITlfrsQ,2020-11-26 00:47:22,Twitter for iPhone,982,7599
Millions of responsible gun owners gave their hard earned money to the NRA an organization that ended up just being a get rich quick scheme for its executives. Private jets lavish meals and pocketed cash.  https://t.co/FumhuMjgyx,2020-11-26 00:42:42,Twitter for iPhone,198,752
Visited Manchester Hospital today w @jrojas9 @Doucette13th @MayorADJayMoran. They do drive thru testing but would add hours if they had more testing kits. The failure of the current administration to produce enough testing material is a huge problem that Biden must solve. https://t.co/cPv4HuCXbB,2020-11-25 20:58:22,Twitter for iPhone,62,343
This is what makes Hartford a great place. Was out in my new neighborhood and came across a small group of south end friends and family who in 48 hours put together a food and clothing giveaway on South Green. In the rain!

Small Business Saturday is coming up. And it’s never been more important to support locally owned stores than this year. @bdflorsheim @SenBlumenthal and I shopped in downtown Middletown today! https://t.co/GXHEARLcmF,2020-11-25 01:23:29,Twitter for iPhone,39,305
The need and desperation out there is hard to comprehend. I was at a Thanksgiving dinner distribution in Hamden tonight. They had 300 turkeys and I think there were 300 cars lined up before the event began.   @senatemajldr please come to the table on relief bill negotiations. https://t.co/vttCHtJ2Wu,2020-11-25 01:21:02,Twitter for iPhone,1105,4292
These are just a few ideas that don’t always find a home inside the national security consensus.   But I’ve worked w many on Biden’s team and I know they are willing to work with progressives - and anyone else with new good ideas - to make American foreign policy more nimble.,2020-11-24 23:01:25,Twitter for iPhone,50,593
9/ Restore America’s commitment to a two-state future in the Middle East. Take a hard line on new settlements and annexation. Restore funding for humanitarian programs in the PA. Being an ally of Israel’s security means charting a path to a Palestinian state.,2020-11-24 23:01:25,Twitter for iPhone,49,503
8/ Let’s stop blindly fueling a dangerous arms race in the Middle East. The equipment we send to UAE ends up w extremist militias. The bombs we send to Saudi end up killing kids in Yemen. And it all just leads to an Iranian arms buildup. Let’s be more judicious in arms sales.,2020-11-24 23:01:25,Twitter for iPhone,50,514
7/ Foreign policy must = climate policy. But diplomacy alone can’t save the planet. We need hard dollars for America to spend abroad to help developing nations cover to clean energy. Billions for a supersized Green Climate Fund.,2020-11-24 23:01:24,Twitter for iPhone,30,429
6/ Progressives don’t hate trade deals - just trade deals that are written for corporations instead of workers and citizens. Let’s do a new Asia trade agreement but one that is written to protect wages not profits and shareholder returns.,2020-11-24 23:01:24,Twitter for iPhone,48,510
5/ No military action without congressional authorization. Yes it’s hard to get sign off from Congress for a military strike. But for good reason. Americans are rightly skeptical about military action and that’s why the Constitution vests the war making power in Congress.,2020-11-24 23:01:24,Twitter for iPhone,44,475
4/ Sanctions can have impact but their overuse is risking making the tactic feckless. Too often the are just a box checking exercise. Or they hurt orindary people while not changing the behavior of foreign regimes. We need to be much more strategic in our sanctions use.,2020-11-24 23:01:24,Twitter for iPhone,31,430
3/ Choose to fight Russia symmetrically. That means plussing up counter-propaganda anti-corruption and energy independence programming on Russia’s periphery. In general we need more non-military tools in our foreign policy toolkit.,2020-11-24 23:01:24,Twitter for iPhone,46,513
2/ Secret wars exempt from public view or oversight too often go off the rails. For example our drone program more often kills the wrong target adding fuel to extremist groups recruitment drives.,2020-11-24 23:01:23,Twitter for iPhone,35,485
1/ For instance it’s time for America to finally shake our hubris of what can be accomplished by military deployments in far off places. Restraint IS a policy. Often our intervention (think Iraq or Libya or Syria) ends up doing much more harm than good.,2020-11-24 23:01:23,Twitter for iPhone,91,858
THREAD: Yes @ABlinken and Biden’s national security team have loads of experience but they are open to new ideas.  That’s key bc U.S. foreign policy has become dangerously sclerotic and progressives have offered several productive critiques of the national security consensus.,2020-11-24 23:01:23,Twitter for iPhone,355,1991
What a score for President-elect Biden. Getting legislation through a closely divided Senate is going to be tough but no one knows the Senate better than Reema. And she’s a straight shooter who is trusted by Republicans too. https://t.co/G3lLwdw80u,2020-11-24 17:32:22,Twitter for iPhone,218,1606

If @GSAEmily does not allow for the transition to begin this week she will go down as one of the most infamous figures in recent American history.

Be smart this week. With vaccines around the corner it would be tragic for the holidays to become superspreading events. And getting tested ahead of time isn't sufficient. A negative test last weekend doesn't mean you couldn't be contagious by Thursday or the weekend.,2020-11-23 16:50:53,Twitter Web App,425,2230
What adds to the offense is that he actually doesn’t want to be President. https://t.co/Gk6Zo0ufAq,2020-11-22 20:22:48,Twitter for iPhone,571,5225
Trump is alleging Sen. Loeffler carried out a massive voter fraud operation in Georgia. That sounds like big news that should have an effect on the runoff. https://t.co/MTIbb7lltJ,2020-11-22 19:43:11,Twitter for iPhone,1707,5504

Donald Trump hauled the leaders of the Michigan state legislature into the Oval Office and demanded they overturn the vote and appoint Trump’s electors despite the fact that Trump lost the state by 150000 votes and the Republican Party generally seems okay with that.,2020-11-21 23:14:15,Twitter for iPhone,5607,25231
This says nothing. What do you mean “if”? Have you not come to a conclusion on whether the massive vote rigging conspiracy Trump alleges exists? Because if you still believe it might be true and your public statements suggest it could be true then you’re doing his work for him. https://t.co/FnO2G1u1mR,2020-11-21 23:09:41,Twitter for iPhone,245,1498
Shelters are going to need an infusion of resources this winter to make sure they can keep people off the streets and do it in a safe way.   I visited South Park Inn in Hartford yesterday to learn why federal funds are so necessary to combat homelessness during this third wave. https://t.co/8Zn5xD6920,2020-11-21 18:35:12,Twitter for iPhone,85,564
Feels like Trump's strong arming isn't working because the election just isn't close enough to steal.  Think about 2 or 4 years from now when QAnon Republicans have fully taken over the party and the election is actually close.,2020-11-21 16:25:20,Twitter Web App,1966,10760
Leaving the Hartford office right now and looking up at a moonlight drenched Colt dome. Every day I go to work under two of the most iconic beautiful domes in America. Lucky. https://t.co/VFAJ3Sthdc,2020-11-20 22:15:25,Twitter for iPhone,59,1544
7/ It's time for action by Republicans. They need to work with Democrats to force the transition to begin. Every day we lose gravely jeopardizes Biden's ability to implement a vaccination effort that must be larger faster and more competent than anything America has ever seen.,2020-11-20 22:02:23,Twitter Web App,743,4135
6/ Implementing Trump's plan "as is" would take 2 months of rigorous cooperation between the Trump and Biden teams.  But almost certainly Biden is going to need time to make changes to assure Trump's vaccination plan works. Again this can't happen absent a transition process.,2020-11-20 22:02:23,Twitter Web App,367,2589
5/ Second Trump's team is in denial about how expensive this vaccination plan will be. On the call they told us states won't need any more money. That's just false. In fact states have told Congress they need $8.4 BILLION to run this complicated system. https://t.co/D43p8gsqEU,2020-11-20 22:02:22,Twitter Web App,491,2627
4/ Two warning signs. First in our call yesterday Trump's team told us states were in charge. But the feds have already contracted with some chain pharmacies to distribute vaccines. This confusion of responsibility is exactly how we got the PPE shortage. https://t.co/hVcKwVs33v,2020-11-20 22:02:22,Twitter Web App,516,2824
3/ Trump and his team have screwed up every logistical element of COVID response so far. 80% of nurses say they don't have adequate PPE. Many have to wait in 3 hour lines for a test. Why would Trump's vaccine plan be magically different?  https://t.co/LbbHIP4sfT,2020-11-20 22:02:22,Twitter Web App,526,2859
2/ Vaccinating 300m people would be an enormous undertaking w a single simple vaccine. But this plan envisions multiple vaccines with some vaccines requiring ultra-cold storage (which we don't much of) and multiple doses (requiring tracking systems). https://t.co/u339L6KIMW,2020-11-20 22:02:22,Twitter Web App,382,2383
Due to Trump's petulant delusional democracy-smashing refusal to accept the election results his Administration is refusing share details with President-elect Biden's team about their vaccination distribution plan .   1/ A short THREAD on why that's going to get people killed.,2020-11-20 22:02:22,Twitter Web App,4353,14303
Egyptian authorities have arrested staff members from @EIPR apparently just for meeting with EU diplomats. This is the latest development in an ongoing crackdown on political freedom.

Visited a testing site in Bloomfield today to thank our front line workers. The line is about 90 minutes long right now. My staffers who got tested last weekend in other parts of the state waited 3 hours.

First there needs to be an integration between Trump's team and Biden's team to assure a clean hand-off of a complicated distribution plan.  Second Biden will likely want to improve the plan but he can't do that effectively if he isn't read into ahead of time.,2020-11-19 15:59:43,Twitter Web App,1947,15789

It which Trump is firing everyone ruining careers and compromising our nation's security so that he can install stooges that will release sensitive classified information about...wait for it....wait for it....

For example the new acting head of intelligence at DoD is a 34 year old named Ezra Cohen Watnick a Michael Flynn follower who was promptly fired from his job as soon as Gen. McMasters took over. Watnick advocated for the CIA to orchestrate an overthrow the Iranian regime.,2020-11-11 02:02:31,Twitter Web App,958,2980
Could be smoke. Could be fire. But the purge happening at the Department of Defense in the middle of a messy transition should worry us all.

This is a massive arms deal that is completely inappropriate for a lame duck Administration. It's a transparent attempt to narrow options in the Middle East for President-elect Biden when he takes office. https://t.co/w6TFUodFBv,2020-11-10 18:12:34,Twitter Web App,3829,10175
The question is - can Democrats convince our army of small donors to spend 50% of the money they sent to candidates on state-specific sustainable political mobilization efforts instead. Because if we can do that we will be unbeatable.,2020-11-10 16:57:19,Twitter Web App,2144,12626
Republicans are in court right now trying to take health care away from 23 million Americans. Whether they win or lose the case they will never stop trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act.

The Pfizer vaccine requires a complicated and expensive distribution process so with lots of other vaccine candidates $2B in taxpayer money to pay for the distribution is a big leg up. Again not saying Trump should take credit but the government $$ matter here. https://t.co/xXFtBWzk8r,2020-11-09 15:46:30,Twitter Web App,109,519
Trump shouldn't take the credit for the Pfizer/BioNTech progress but it's not fair to suggest that this was simply a "private sector" effort. They got purchase/distribution contracts from the U.S. EU and Japan and BioNTech got $445M in funding from the German government. https://t.co/FHudn7ETTW,2020-11-09 15:32:14,Twitter Web App,415,1505

FYI a lot of people are tweeting about how Pfizer didn't accept government money for this vaccine. This isn't true. HHS did a $2 billion deal with Pfizer to guarantee a market for the vaccine making Pfizer's R&amp;D spend viable. Classic public/private partnership.,2020-11-09 14:42:22,Twitter Web App,4127,14940
6/ These are just a few of many simmering crises.  Congress can fill part of the void.

5/ Russia and Turkey will also be watching. In Donbass one aggressive move by Russian forces could destabilize the contact line.

4/ China's bet would be that a) Trump would be distracted by his election grievances and b) his national security infrastructure might be hollowed out. They would gamble that by the time Biden was sworn in their move would be a fait accompli and impossible to reverse.,2020-11-09 02:38:52,Twitter Web App,260,1571
3/ Emerging global powers could try to take advantage of the vacuum. At the top of that list is China. They could finish their crack down in Hong Kong or they could make a move on the disputed islands with Taiwan. https://t.co/XKkDxJSWeu,2020-11-09 02:38:52,Twitter Web App,269,1658
2/ Reports suggest Trump's post-defeat rage could lead to the firings of Esper or Haspel. DoD and/or CIA could be leaderless by Thanksgiving.

7/ No one saw it. No press reported on it. But here was the Vice President of the United States sitting for hours with parents of urban gun crime telling them their kids’ lives mattered. To him.   He didn’t need to do it but he did - because that’s who Joe Biden is.,2020-11-03 16:02:33,Twitter for iPhone,3136,25943
6/ I expected him to say hello and then head out. But that’s not what happened. He sat in that room talking with those parents - FOR HOURS. Listening intently to each of their stories.

5/ Biden had promised to say hello so they had stuck around. But by the time he got to them he had already been in CT for 5 hours or so &amp; he still had to fly back to DC.

3/ He stayed after his speech to meet with the Sandy Hook parents. In a somber room off the main hall he spent about 2 hours with about 10 families.

The virus is spreading uncontrolled. 80000 cases 1000 deaths today. The stock market dropped by over 900 points.   Trump has given up and if he’s re-elected he will see it as a mandate to keep undermining efforts to control the spread. 2021 will be worse than 2020.,2020-10-29 01:46:02,Twitter for iPhone,2304,7570

That’s the weird thing about @CoryBooker. The whole “liking people” brand is as it turns out not an act. But yes it’s time consuming when you’re in public w him.   Did he say he will help us raise $$ today for @harrisonjaime? https://t.co/fhv77jLcfy,2020-10-27 15:49:04,Twitter for iPhone,87,1120
Yes.   First campaigns can still book TV radio and online ads time and the candidate gets preferred slots/lowest rates. Ads bought this this morning can air tonight.

I just texted with Jaime. He says GOP $$ are flooding in and he needs help. Race is legit tied and Pence is holding a superspreader rally there today for Graham.

Schatz I’m furious at what just happened. But the only thing worse than having Coney Barrett rammed down our throat would be for McConnell to remain in charge.   I’m jumping in the car to drive back to CT. I’ll pull over a few times to check progress.  But c‘mon team - LFG. https://t.co/EatsZoDBTV,2020-10-27 00:14:34,Twitter for iPhone,1934,11569
Hey Schatz and I wouldn’t ask you to donate tonight to Harrison if it wasn’t a good use of $$. McConnell just dumped a TON of money there and right now Jaime can’t match it.  If you’re angry tonight before you go bed click donate. $50 $25 $10 whatever. https://t.co/mHT848TplM,2020-10-27 00:10:47,Twitter for iPhone,250,597

Ok @brianschatz and I just checked - Jaime Harrison still needs money to match the huge ad buy McConnell’s PAC just placed in South Carolina.   Tonight would be amazing night to send a message to Lindsay Graham.   Last poll:  Harrison 47 Graham 45  Give below. Let’s go. https://t.co/EatsZoDBTV,2020-10-26 23:05:26,Twitter for iPhone,782,2264
Hey @brianschatz can you check - if we raised money for Jaime Harrison tonight could he put the money to good use down the home stretch?  I bet we could do $250K tonight to beat Graham.,2020-10-26 22:54:45,Twitter for iPhone,1423,6704

Pence's decision to come to Senate today when he should be quarantining puts people at risk - mostly the staff on the dais who cannot socially distance from him.

Just finished the 3-5am shift on the Senate floor in protest of the vote later today on radical Amy Coney Barrett.

See below - this is why we can win Georgia.   But turnout like this doesn’t continue without organization. That’s why we need to raise another $100000 tonight for Jon Ossoff’s turnout operations. Pls give here: https://t.co/mcUlM320bW https://t.co/bmOKB9GQ0k,2020-10-26 01:12:09,Twitter for iPhone,372,1466
Ok. But not until we win.   News broke today that if Trump wins he plans to fire the heads of DoD FBI and CIA and replace w his stooges. That’s not a surprise but it’s confirmation of the democracy apocalypse that is coming if we don’t win. https://t.co/e4iNK3BJpW,2020-10-26 01:02:52,Twitter for iPhone,660,2783
Hey we’re at $500000 to flip the Georgia Senate seat. Amazing.  We need to do another $100K. But @brianschatz and I are the 2 Senators covering the Senate floor overnight to keep the Coney Barrett fight going.  Can you guys handle this? $100K more.   https://t.co/mcUlM320bW,2020-10-26 00:21:35,Twitter for iPhone,807,2741
Holy moly. A half million dollars in 8 hours. That’s a record right??  But extra $100K tonight for @ossoff tonight could be the difference between win and lose. Let’s up the goal to $600K. It’s important. We win Georgia McConnell is the minority leader. https://t.co/mcUlM320bW https://t.co/dIMlhUk0pl,2020-10-25 23:58:56,Twitter for iPhone,691,2898

1. Funny thing to be on a government  plane.   2. If the overall poll says you’re losing why is it a good thing that your portion of the voters are the ones who haven’t yet actually voted? Your still losing and now there’s a shot you’ll lose big if your folks don’t turn up. https://t.co/gGANARMyNn,2020-10-25 23:42:49,Twitter for iPhone,188,1270
At this point we would be better off if the Trump Administration just did NOTHING on #COVID19. The nation would be safer if the whole White House stayed in bed all day.

Amazing. Remember a great Ossoff turnout operation helps the whole ticket. Helps Warnock and Biden too. And Biden is heading to Georgia Tuesday which tells you which way they think the state is heading.  We can do 140K more - I know we can. https://t.co/kxdVf6k8Yb,2020-10-25 20:00:11,Twitter Web App,320,1483
Yup the late billionaire Super PAC money is concerning. But that’s why we set our goal so ridiculously high today.   Ossoff says he needs this $500K to run the turnout campaign his team has designed.   So we’ve been at it for 3.5 hours...where we at? Can we make it? https://t.co/t2r0VEacgR,2020-10-25 19:06:28,Twitter for iPhone,263,1043
McConnell's PAC is basically just Sheldon Adelson money. One billionaire is holding up the entire Georgia GOP.  We need to do it differently. Thousands and thousands of donations powering a grassroots campaign. And believe me if we hit $500K today - that makes a huge dif. https://t.co/7c5e33FEB3,2020-10-25 18:17:36,Twitter Web App,412,1698
ON FIRE for the first hour. Great job team. $500K is possible. Lots of work to do but possible.  @brianschatz and I need to jet for an hour to go vote against Amy Coney Barrett on the Senate floor. Do us a solid - by the time we’re done can we do another $75K? https://t.co/AtFMCIl1SN,2020-10-25 16:26:10,Twitter for iPhone,902,3410
🚨 🚨 McConnell just placed a giant ad buy in Georgia. And I can tell you why - internal polls show Sen. Perdue in BIG trouble.  So today a HUGE goal: raise $500K for Jon Ossoff. He’s short on $$ for his turnout effort. Folks if we win GA it’s OVER. https://t.co/mcUlM320bW,2020-10-25 15:31:34,Twitter for iPhone,6902,18208

We should fight back against any foreign country that is trying to interfere in our election no matter what their agenda is.

How do we know tonight’s press conference isn’t on the level?   The DNI knew for months there was a Russian agent who had penetrated Trump’s inner circle in order to spread fake anti-Biden propaganda and...no press conference. Just a footnote in a Treasury sanctions announcement.,2020-10-22 01:19:17,Twitter for iPhone,7458,24622
The e-mails told voters to support Trump but the DNI is sure the intent was to hurt Trump? That’s a dubious claim that seems motivated by the Administration’s desperation to distract from Russian interference and create false equivalencies between Russian and Iranian efforts.,2020-10-22 01:03:43,Twitter for iPhone,4122,14759

All his life Doug Jones just did the right thing. Prosecute the 16th St Church bombers no matter the backlash. Run against Roy Moore no matter the odds.   Now WE need to do the right thing.

$133000 raised so far today. Crazy awesome.  @BetoORourke says early voting is off the charts and both Biden and Hegar can win. If that’s true then it’s all over.   18 days to go.

Let me break down why @brianschatz and I are asking you to donate to MJ Hegar today.  She is down 3 pts.  But among voters that know her name MJ’s up 3. Among voters that don’t know her MJ is down 15.  Get it? Texas is where your $$ goes the furthest.  https://t.co/pOzXf4Er5F,2020-10-18 19:31:44,Twitter for iPhone,1829,3381
YES! This is where the money will go the furthest right now. Obviously a super expensive state so every dollar has a ⬆️ marginal return.   Latest polling:  Cornyn 49 Hegar 46  Remember how strong Beto closed in 2018? MJ needs the resources to do the same. https://t.co/i1wKMjO9s2,2020-10-18 18:45:15,Twitter for iPhone,1716,3971

If it makes you feel better keep believing Fauci and Redfield are in charge of #COVID19 response.   But they aren't. This guy is. Scott Atlas is Trump's current top COVID advisor.

8/ And American media do have major credibility for good reason. They do amazing work and get most stories 100% right.   Russia wants to use this credibility to their advantage. And that’s why we all have to be vigilant. Democracy depends on it.,2020-10-17 12:58:29,Twitter for iPhone,4066,18051
7/ Why is it important for media to not simply pick this story up and amplify it? Why should we be offended that the VP is being asked about it?  Because this is Russia’s bet - that America and its media is so hungry for salacious stories that no one will vet their lies.,2020-10-17 12:58:29,Twitter for iPhone,5513,20391
6/ Further media don’t need a Pulitzer to see the whole story as super fishy.  A pro-Trump computer repairman mysteriously comes across Hunter Biden’s laptop copies the files and guess who gets them?

3/ Andriy Derkach was a top Russian agent. He was unmasked by the Treasury Dept this summer. Derkach and his team recruited Guiliani and have been feeding him info all year. The White House knew this.  https://t.co/kxXA84fynC,2020-10-17 12:58:28,Twitter for iPhone,5429,16961
2/ Russia knew it had to play a different game than 2016. So it built an operation to cull virulently pro-Trump Americans as pseudo-assets so blind in their allegiance to Trump that they’ll willingly launder Kremlin constructed anti-Biden propaganda.   Guiliani was a key target.,2020-10-17 12:58:27,Twitter for iPhone,4798,18361
Joe Biden - and all of us - SHOULD be furious that media outlets are spreading what is very likely Russian propaganda.  1/ I’ve seen the intel. The mainstreaming of misinformation is Russia’s 2020 goal. Here’s what we know and why we can’t take it lying down.,2020-10-17 12:58:26,Twitter for iPhone,27343,71922

Hey @brianschatz this thing is moving fast. We just crossed $100K for the fund to flip 10 state legislative chambers.  State legislative control matters. On voting rights. Climate. Health care.

The Texas statehouse is the holy grail. We win Texas we undo their gerrymandered U.S. House map.  We need to flip just 9 seats. They are all winnable. They are all part of this fund @brianschatz and I are pushing.  Let’s go. Can we do another $20K by 8pm? https://t.co/EuLaZjWRvu,2020-10-15 23:14:42,Twitter for iPhone,1001,2231
Tonight @brianschatz and I are asking you to do something different - to make our 2020 victory overwhelming.   Help us flip 10 state houses. For instance in Iowa if we win 4 races Dems control the House.   Totally possible. If you help right now. https://t.co/EuLaZjWRvu,2020-10-15 20:52:36,Twitter for iPhone,235,621
The return on investment here is OFF THE CHARTS. All the money we raise tonight gets split among 48 local races that will decide control of 10 (10!) state legislative chambers.

Yeah state legislatures are where redistricting maps and voting laws are written. Dems have ignored these races for too long.    I won by 800 in my first race. Busted my ass to raise $24000.

Cory was asking a specific question: Does she believe in the PEACEFUL transition of power - meaning forsaking the use of the military or police to maintain power.   Coney Barrett’s refusal to answer is frightening. https://t.co/CIpwCwXs9M,2020-10-13 23:15:00,Twitter for iPhone,2175,6002
If you are pissed off at what Senate Republicans are doing on TV today then we have one recourse - WIN THE SENATE.   And we can’t win the Senate without Minnesota and NH.

Hey @brianschatz the amount of $$ people did for Michigan was nuts. Thank you team.   But Michigan’s not the only firewall state w a competive Senate race right? There are other hot spots that need help I think.,2020-10-13 17:54:45,Twitter for iPhone,304,1840
Incredibly we are closing in on a half million dollars raised in just over 24 hours. A few more donations overnight should get us there.

🚨🚨Yesterday @brianschatz and I asked you to help our colleague Gary Peters in Michigan.  Well NYT just released a new poll:  Peters 43 James 42  This means McConnell will pour in more $$. We raised $330K for him yesterday. We need to do more. Right now. https://t.co/eDW2JPwVWK,2020-10-12 23:30:40,Twitter for iPhone,700,1483
11/ That's why Republicans are rushing her nomination. The hearing on the case is the week after election day. They NEED Coney-Barrett on the court for the hearing so that they can get a 5-4 decision to invalidate the ACA by early next year.  So their plan can be complete.,2020-10-12 16:36:05,Twitter Web App,1125,3548
10/ So Trump decided to take no chances when picking the deciding vote. Amy Coney Barrett is a no doubter. She is vocal in her belief that the ACA is unconstitutional. She's a lock to be the 5th vote to invalidate the ACA.  https://t.co/8IjRwy7jPN,2020-10-12 16:36:04,Twitter Web App,949,2888
9/ Now the case is in front of SCOTUS. Alito and Thomas have already ruled against the ACA. Their votes are known. And really so are those of Kavanaugh/Gorsuch. Trump promised to only appoint judges who would strike down the ACA. So the court is now likely 4-4 on the case.,2020-10-12 16:36:04,Twitter Web App,758,2687
8/ Many thought the suit Texas v. U.S. was bogus but they underestimated McConnell and Trump's plan. Last December the 5th Circuit ruled for the plaintiffs - the entire ACA should be invalidated.  It was a Trump appointed judge who provided the pivotal vote (surprise again!).,2020-10-12 16:36:04,Twitter Web App,759,2800
7/ Then the court strategy began. 20 GOP AGs filed a suit alleging that the repeal of the mandate tax required the entire ACA to be invalidated (surprise!).   When Trump took office he broke with precedent and joined the suit against his own government. https://t.co/voNYHwOjkh,2020-10-12 16:36:03,Twitter Web App,757,2683
6/ Then McConnell began his campaign to pack the federal courts w anti-ACA ideologues who would rule against the ACA.  He blocked Obama's nominees for 2 years creating 100+ vacancies for Trump and most importantly stole a SCOTUS nomination from Obama. https://t.co/U8GENmdlYx,2020-10-12 16:36:03,Twitter Web App,1054,3131
5/ The plan began with tucking into the 2017 Trump tax bill a repeal of the individual mandate tax. Curiously the bill left intact the mandate.  This was purposeful bc the Supreme Court had upheld the ACA in 2012 based on the existence of the tax.  https://t.co/zXbVf3RKWi,2020-10-12 16:36:03,Twitter Web App,693,2640
4/ But after McCain's thumbs down in 2017 Republicans came up with a new plan. If voters wouldn't allow them to repeal the ACA through the elected branch of government then they would go another way - the courts.  McConnell and Trump put together a devious detailed plan.,2020-10-12 16:36:02,Twitter Web App,848,3058
3/ At first Republicans' chanted "repeal and replace" - but they NEVER had a plan to replace it.  In 2017 with much fanfare Paul Ryan unveiled the most serious replacement bill Republicans had ever offered. It ended health care for 23 million Americans. https://t.co/wEKBpYYsyI,2020-10-12 16:36:02,Twitter Web App,866,3059
2/ From the start Republicans were obsessed - I mean OBSESSED - with getting rid of the ACA. Nothing mattered more.  From 2010-2017 they tried to repeal all or part of the ACA 70 times. Their most high profile failure was of course in summer 2017. https://t.co/wx97kNmKFR,2020-10-12 16:36:01,Twitter Web App,1106,3501
1/ Republicans are suddenly trying to pretend that their rush to confirm Amy Coney Barrett isn't about ACA repeal.  They are lying.  I've put together in one thread the story of their 10 year plan to get rid of the ACA. It all leads to this moment.  Please read the whole thing.,2020-10-12 16:36:01,Twitter Web App,10619,23949
This is a bit weedy but a must read for Connecticut policy-makers.

So the entire GOP establishment including Trump are pushing a lawsuit they know will fail? BS. In fact both lower courts ruled for Trump and the requested remedy is the invalidation of the entire ACA. And yes the suit's chances WERE low but now Barrett tips the balance. https://t.co/7D3vLmiDD6,2020-10-12 14:08:36,Twitter Web App,335,1111

Yes he may still be sick. But “going on the road” means a 1 hour rally and 14 hours of watching TV. It’s not like he’s running the country while on the road or something like that.

8/ This is all REALLY radical stuff.   Coney Barrett will be the 5th vote to rewrite the 2nd Amendment. SCOTUS will be able to rule bans on assault weapons and background checks unconstitutional.   The plan to legislate gun policy from the bench.   We can't let it happen.,2020-10-08 16:26:30,Twitter Web App,1109,3643
7/ But Wisconsin HAD provided proof. It just wasn't ENOUGH for Barrett who clearly had read plenty of NRA-funded studies arguing against background checks.  So Barrett thinks that gun laws are unconstitutional so long as a study exists that says more guns equal less crime.,2020-10-08 16:26:29,Twitter Web App,597,2325
6/ Second she said that legislatures had to "prove" that the gun law they passed would reduce violence and claimed Wisconsin hadn't provided that proof. Thus Barrett said the restriction was unconstitutional.,2020-10-08 16:26:29,Twitter Web App,519,2054
5/ In Kanter Barrett said two things that made clear she intends to legislate from the bench.  First she said that courts not the legislature should decide who is too dangerous to own a gun. She said courts should take that power away from the legislature. Just mind-blowing.,2020-10-08 16:26:29,Twitter Web App,783,2532
4/ But it's not just her general philosophy - it's her stunning dissent in Kanter v. Barr. There she broke with decades of precedent (and Scalia's decision in DC v. Heller) upholding the constitutionality of background checks and argued that felons have a right to own guns.,2020-10-08 16:26:29,Twitter Web App,644,2297
3/ So for instance that makes it easy for her to rule against bans on weapons that didn't exist in the 1700s (like semi-automatic weapons) or restrictions on guns in places that didn't exist (like airplanes) or background checks for felonies that post-date 1787.,2020-10-08 16:26:29,Twitter Web App,590,2310
2/ Like Gorsuch/Kavanaugh/Alito/Thomas she is an "orginalist" on guns. It's total BS - just a way to legislate from the court and invalidate modern gun laws.   But basically she believes that if the regulation didn't exist in 1787 then it's unconstitutional.,2020-10-08 16:26:28,Twitter Web App,743,2838
1/ In light of Amy Coney Barrett's dangerous views on choice and the ACA her views on guns haven't gotten much attention.  But she's a radical - a blinking red outlier - on how she interprets the 2nd Amendment. Like she wants felons to buy guns.  And you need to know.

Admittedly the CDC has issued three different rules in 2 months (due to political pressure from the White House).  But...the rule currently is this: if you've been within 6 ft of a person with COVID for more than 15 minutes or if you've touched them you need to quarantine.,2020-10-05 15:55:48,Twitter Web App,263,1155
Okay. https://t.co/3QCcA2fXcI,2020-10-05 15:51:56,Twitter Web App,122,1708
These people think this is all a game.  Everyone in that White House who was exposed to Hope Hicks and the President should have begun quarantine last week.  They don't care about the rules which is why we have 200000 dead. Vote them all out. https://t.co/veNJULR7aY,2020-10-05 15:48:29,Twitter Web App,2037,6382

Incredible. We are at $208282 to help Dr. Al Gross become the next Senator from Alaska.   Latest poll:  Sullivan 46 Gross 45  Talked to Al today.

It's hard to get your head around how damaging the White House's recklessness has been. Even if NJ doesn't find a ton of positive people it will cost money and manpower to track down 206 people. Money that NJ doesn't have. https://t.co/PbjAtCZOE5,2020-10-04 20:17:11,Twitter Web App,641,2027

He’s doing it!  Make a donation to win the Alaska Senate seat and Cory Booker might @ you!  Link to give here: https://t.co/vyoimugp6f  I will start replying too to because this is amazing. https://t.co/ifEjOyAmGr,2020-10-04 19:40:10,Twitter for iPhone,193,602
Hey @CoryBooker if you promise to thank donors personally with replies on twitter I think we can get @DrAlGrossAK to $150K within the next hour.  The Alaska Senate race is tied Booker!  I'll do it too. Yes? https://t.co/g2k3onaqHI,2020-10-04 19:27:05,Twitter Web App,462,1416
Hey @CoryBooker @TeamHeinrich @brianschatz @JeffMerkley something is happening today.   New record for donations in first hour. $95809. Whoa.  Halfway to $200K. Let's go!  Al Gross can win. Alaska is TIED. And if we win Alaska that's the ballgame.  https://t.co/vyoimugp6f,2020-10-04 19:22:42,Twitter Web App,989,2288
Seriously? $200000 by the end of the day?   Listen $200K goes a long way in Alaska. Could be a difference maker. Fine. I'm in.   After what people have seen the last 3 days I think everybody knows the stakes.   LET'S GO.

Today let’s expand the map.  Latest Alaska poll:  Sullivan 46 Gross 45  Al Gross doctor/fisherman/activist can win. But it’s a late breaking close race and he needs help.  Can we do $100K? Big goal but if we win here GOP has no shot to hold the Senate. https://t.co/vyoimugp6f,2020-10-04 18:14:50,Twitter for iPhone,4723,10325
Ok stand by for a link a big goal for today.   I will use my discretion but I have an idea based on some good data I recently saw and suggestion from @TeamHeinrich. https://t.co/bnDJdxx4FQ,2020-10-04 17:31:55,Twitter for iPhone,99,611
Hey @brianschatz @CoryBooker @JeffMerkley et al - I’m ready to find a candidate and set another big goal today.  After the last few wild days it’s 100% clear the Senate GOP has lost the right to govern.  So let’s get under McConnell’s skin and expand the map. Ideas?,2020-10-04 16:38:18,Twitter for iPhone,1572,6751
Millions in taxpayer funded health care will be spent to try to keep the Senate in session throughout October in order to pack the Court with enough judges to rip health care from millions of Americans not lucky enough to be Senators or White House staff with free health care.,2020-10-03 17:35:48,Twitter Web App,5404,11645
All they care about is taking away your health care. They will let nothing stop them. https://t.co/51f8T42kfF,2020-10-03 16:51:16,Twitter Web App,2960,8690
And last week after the Amy Coney Barrett super-spreading event at the White House Senate GOP held their regular in person meetings.  And still this weekend McConnell refuses to implement Senate-wide testing program.,2020-10-03 16:13:37,Twitter Web App,912,3086
FYI Senate GOP holds in person meetings 3x a week. Dem Senators hold our meetings virtually.  In those GOP meetings some wear masks and others don't. Low wage food service workers are required to be in attendance.   But McConnell still refuses to test every worker in the Senate.,2020-10-03 16:10:28,Twitter Web App,5918,15509
The President is in the hospital with a deadly virus.  Three Senators (and counting) are sick.  But incredibly McConnell says it's still business as usual.   Why? Because he's one vote away from ending the ACA and taking insurance from 23m Americans and NOTHING WILL STOP HIM.,2020-10-03 14:15:58,Twitter Web App,16034,46120
Nothing has changed. https://t.co/jhEyRIWK12,2020-10-03 02:34:01,Twitter for iPhone,341,1419

If Trump wants to remain in charge - if he isn’t willing to invoke the 25th amendment - then he must continue to be held accountable.   Biden sees this as a national crisis and is pulling down negative ads. Trump is keeping his up and lying about why. https://t.co/zur7J2sYvq,2020-10-03 00:36:20,Twitter for iPhone,1773,5334
Hey @brianschatz @CoryBooker see below. Let’s do a race soon. Another big goal. https://t.co/f7ByX1qyML,2020-10-02 21:27:58,Twitter for iPhone,37,272
Jamal Khashoggi was murdered by the Saudi government two years ago today. And yet the Saudis still get everything they ask from Donald Trump. No consequences. No justice. Just shameful. https://t.co/4NTRcdMBZh,2020-10-02 21:10:16,Twitter Web App,730,1704
Whoa. Read these.  Keep working!! https://t.co/DxMxHEw45W,2020-10-02 20:10:41,Twitter for iPhone,215,845
Just finished a conversation w @jimsciutto.   We need to be ready for Russia to increase the pace of interference operations to make up for Trump’s coming absence from the campaign trail. Putin will do anything necessary to help Trump win. https://t.co/cVvNtrcfxb,2020-10-02 15:48:32,Twitter for iPhone,628,1343
Everyone in the Capitol complex needs to be tested.   Every Republican Senator or staff member who was in close contact with Trump needs to quarantine.   No business should proceed in the Senate until we understand the scope of this crisis.,2020-10-02 15:35:21,Twitter Web App,8483,35766
3/ And from Harvard on how you can test negative and still spread:  "Results may...be affected by the timing of the test...The chance of getting a false negative test result decreases if you are tested a few days after you were infected or a few days after you develop symptoms.",2020-10-02 15:30:01,Twitter Web App,1026,4931
2/ Here is the relevant section from the CDC website on people who have been in contact with a COVID positive person:  "Even if you test negative for COVID-19 or feel healthy you should stay home (quarantine) since symptoms may appear 2 to 14 days after exposure to the virus.",2020-10-02 15:30:01,Twitter Web App,1349,6207
1/ It's just incredible. The White House is still even today openly violating CDC guidelines - costing lives.  Meadows should not have given that briefing. Even if you test negative you must quarantine for 14 days if you have been in contact with someone who is positive.,2020-10-02 15:30:01,Twitter Web App,9702,38468
Let's be clear...COVID didn't sneak up on the President.   Since the spring the White House has had multiple positive cases including several people who have direct contact with Trump. And yet he didn't wear a mask at public events or private meetings at the White House. https://t.co/1tDwWsoQE4,2020-10-02 13:08:42,Twitter Web App,2395,8353
It wasn't that they didn't wear masks at rallies and conventions and outdoor events and indoor photo ops and then quietly put them back on when they worked in the White House. They just weren't wearing masks. Anywhere. https://t.co/SO85sqmNNO,2020-10-02 12:59:21,Twitter Web App,455,1709
There will be a lot to say about this but let’s start here: The President and the First Lady have a serious deadly virus and we should all hope for a full recovery. https://t.co/kGp7IV2LuO,2020-10-02 08:49:09,Twitter for iPhone,296,2798

wtf https://t.co/YOXqilQ17k,2020-10-01 21:02:47,Twitter Web App,89,1039
10/ It's why Trump's former National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster said something today that is as shocking as it unsurprising.  He said Trump is "aiding and abetting" Putin's interference campaign.   Wow.  But of course he is. And now you know the details.,2020-10-01 20:59:51,Twitter Web App,20670,50630
9/ What's happening is clear. American intel agencies that are supposed to be totally apolitical have been folded into Trump's campaign.  They are keeping info about Russian interference hidden and overhyping info about China and Iran helping Biden.,2020-10-01 20:59:51,Twitter Web App,11439,29933
8/ No press conference from Intel or the FBI or DHS that they've caught a Russian agent who has been in regular contact with the President's inner circle.   Nope. Just buried in a sanctions announcement. Likely because so many people knew the intel they knew it would come out.,2020-10-01 20:59:51,Twitter Web App,9370,26644
7/ A day later (coincidence!) the Treasury Dept. sanctions Andriy Derkach a Ukrainian politician in charge of spreading Biden conspiracy theories and notes offhand that Derkach is indeed a Russian agent. https://t.co/T68qC5ucMW,2020-10-01 20:59:50,Twitter Web App,8481,24160
6/ Then on 9/9 a bombshell that few noticed. The head of intelligence at DHS (the top guy!) files a whistleblower complaint.   He says the White House instructed him to bury info on Russian interference because it "made the President look bad."   https://t.co/7fQWg6zfDO,2020-10-01 20:59:50,Twitter Web App,15596,32535
5/ On 8/7 an update. This one has 219 words on China/Iran 105 on Russia.  But read it closely - though China gets the lead and the most attention Evanina just says they are "weigh[ing] the risks" of election interference - NOT that they are doing it. https://t.co/65mmDBpVlm,2020-10-01 20:59:50,Twitter Web App,5513,18976
4/ On 7/24 Bill Evanina Trump's counter-intel chief releases a super vague statement. 72 words on Chinese/Iranian interference and 54 words on Russia.  Very puzzling. Congress has never been briefed on any meaningful Chinese/Iranian interference plans. https://t.co/tZJEUWFVET,2020-10-01 20:59:50,Twitter Web App,6067,20560
3/ On July 13 Dem leadership writes a letter to FBI Director Wray asking for an all-Congress briefing especially because the reports we're reading suggest Russian agents are trying to find Members of Congress to assist their interference operation. https://t.co/OdVYpx07UX,2020-10-01 20:59:49,Twitter Web App,7722,22259
2/ Earlier this year reports start coming into Congress about a giant multi-layer Russian effort to help Trump in 2020. Bigger than what they did in 2016. Looks like Russians are trying to get U.S. persons - especially those close to Trump - to help.,2020-10-01 20:59:49,Twitter Web App,8258,24112
This hasn't gotten enough attention but you need to know. Everybody needs to know.  1/ It's about the massive coverup campaign underway to disguise the octopus-like Russian election interference operation being run on Trump's behalf.  Please read this whole thing.,2020-10-01 20:59:49,Twitter Web App,55536,85834
It doesn't get better than Georgia @CoryBooker @brianschatz.  If Warnock wins Dems control the Senate. And a strong Warnock campaign lifts Biden in a state that could decide the Electoral College.  Also...America gets a civil rights leader in the Senate.  LET'S GO. https://t.co/JREzxnpIlf,2020-10-01 19:10:41,Twitter Web App,681,2047
They believe the only way Trump can win is to stop people from voting or stop the votes from being counted.  But for every polling place they close every ballot box they take down will just work harder to make sure 2020 turnout is the highest on record. https://t.co/bKYJegTGsm,2020-10-01 18:41:28,Twitter Web App,462,1459
🚨🚨 https://t.co/CZL0QmCJpR,2020-10-01 17:16:29,Twitter for iPhone,134,318
The Trump Administration has picked a fight with the Catholic church.   Pompeo attacked the Vatican in a tweet and then went to Rome to meet with critics of Pope Francis in order to try to publicly embarrass Vatican leadership.  Just FYI.  https://t.co/mrVsKKp9nB,2020-10-01 13:02:34,Twitter Web App,1409,2275
Here's how this works:  1. Republicans put radical Amy Coney Barrett on the Supreme Court.  2. She provides the 5th vote to strike down the ACA ending protections for preexisting conditions.  3. Insurers make COVID diagnosis a preexisting  condition.  4. We all get screwed.,2020-10-01 12:56:28,Twitter Web App,9754,26440
Highly recommend. It could go very badly. https://t.co/oC4ItoOj6v,2020-09-30 17:36:49,Twitter Web App,39,301
4/ So if AR-15 wielding white supremacists are at the polls this year there are fewer legal remedies to remove them. Trump knows this which is why he is pushing so hard.    But you can do something about it. Volunteer here to help protect the election. https://t.co/6jjRYClv8t,2020-09-30 17:28:21,Twitter Web App,1819,3765
3/ In 1982 Republicans used illegal harassment and voter intimidation to discourage Black Americans from voting. They sent targeted mailings warning about the consequences of voter fraud &amp; posted armed guards at polls in minority neighborhoods. Thus the court intervened.,2020-09-30 17:28:21,Twitter Web App,911,2842
2/ In 2018 a federal judge ended a three decade long court order on the Republican National Committee that placed restrictions on the RNC's "ballot security" measures and Election Day activities at the polls. Why were these restrictions in place?,2020-09-30 17:28:21,Twitter Web App,793,2649
1/ Let's be clear - Trump had a goal last night to get his right wing white supremacists to organize an election day intimidation effort. He succeeded. Recruitment by Proud Boys and others is underway. Here's why this is especially worrying this year - and what you can do.,2020-09-30 17:28:20,Twitter Web App,4688,11616
This will be the story. Trump refused to condemn white supremacy. No - he cheered them on. And they heard him loud and clear. https://t.co/9lJQp49tOH,2020-09-30 03:01:28,Twitter for iPhone,3732,7516
This country hasn’t given up on decency. It just hasn’t.   Any analysis of that tire fire of a debate must start there.,2020-09-30 02:46:15,Twitter for iPhone,198,1491
Down 10 points with a desperate need for the debates to change his fortune Trump has decided to make the debate so unwatchable that most Americans turned this off 15 minutes ago.   Interesting strategy.,2020-09-30 01:40:46,Twitter for iPhone,1158,5829
American intel agencies are now just a division of Trump’s campaign. They gleefully disclose info (no matter how dubious) that Trump will like; they jealously keep secret info that Trump won’t like.   And the damage they are doing to American national security is incalculable. https://t.co/iUvRPw9NLf,2020-09-30 00:03:56,Twitter for iPhone,281,864
5/  Kent Sprague Goshen Andover North Canaan Bethlehem Washington Salisbury Sherman Sterling Salem  That's the total population of 62 towns in CT. And insurance would disappear likely overnight for all these families.  Amy Coney Barrett would create a humanitarian catastrophe.,2020-09-29 15:02:15,Twitter Web App,100,500

1/ If Amy Coney Barrett gets to the Supreme Court the ACA is gone and in Connecticut 260000 will lose their insurance.  That's the equivalent combined population of these CT towns:  Litchfield Easton Durham Haddam Woodstock Old Lyme Essex...  (not done...see rest of thread),2020-09-29 15:02:14,Twitter Web App,438,1215
Amy Coney Barrett was chosen because she is guaranteed to overturn the entirety of the Affordable Care Act within months of being put on the bench.  That's 23m people kicked off insurance in the middle of a pandemic. Rates hikes for 130 million more w preexisting conditions.,2020-09-29 12:53:03,Twitter Web App,2880,6878
1. Trump gets free health care as President.   2. He pays no taxes to help pay for it.   3. He is working really hard to confirm a Supreme Court justice who is going to vote to take away your health care.   Vote.,2020-09-28 14:10:46,Twitter for iPhone,10237,28921

At 1:15pm a few of us set out to raise $200K for MJ Hegar vet/mom/activist/candidate for U.S. Senate in Texas. The race is TIED.  We hit our goal at 7; set a new goal of $300K.  It's 10pm EST. We're $25000 short. Can you: 1) donate below; or 2) RT this. https://t.co/rImYbh31Aa,2020-09-28 01:56:00,Twitter Web App,2019,3781
That’s a lot of math. But I get it.   Home stretch to $300K. And if you’re wondering whether MJ Hegar is worth $75 or $7.50 watch her intro video from her House race in 2018. It will blow your mind. https://t.co/DZZIgZL2n5 https://t.co/MNKHLOikj2,2020-09-28 01:07:06,Twitter for iPhone,113,395
Update: $235981.   We can hit $300K by the end of the night but it’s going to be close.   Did we mention MJ did 3 tours in Afghanistan. Had her helicopter shot down. And though she doesn’t need a reason for her killer tats - they cover her shrapnel wounds. https://t.co/cQMpahULih,2020-09-27 23:35:22,Twitter for iPhone,345,1098
Ok (wiping my brow). $300000. That’s a huge new goal.   But here’s the last poll:  Cornyn 40 Hegar 38  It’s MJ’s to win. And if we win Texas Mitch McConnell is no longer Majority Leader and $750-a-year-in-taxes Donald Trump is no longer President.   LET’S GO. https://t.co/cQMpahULih,2020-09-27 22:35:34,Twitter for iPhone,610,1883
$750.   Seven hundred fifty dollars.  SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS.  That’s why he hid his tax returns.  Because the whole time he wasn’t paying taxes. But you were.  Plumbers and teachers and fast food workers and accountants were (and still are) paying for his lifestyle.  $750.,2020-09-27 21:59:02,Twitter for iPhone,10752,31615
Beto is helping build the biggest baddest field campaign Texas has ever seen for 2020.   Let’s make sure @mjhegar has the money to keep up the GOP super pac machine. Closing in on 200K! Please help. Even if it’s $10. https://t.co/10MvoOxSVe,2020-09-27 21:29:23,Twitter for iPhone,347,1037

The point of this of course is just to be awful. To stick a finger in the eye of Ginsburg's grieving family and anyone mourning her loss.

This piece presupposes that when people think of “the Court” all they think is “culture war” issues.   Not sure this is true.

Heads up - anybody in this country who has had COVID or ever tests positive for the COVID antibodies has a preexisting condition.  And when Trump rams through an anti-health care judge and the ACA is eliminated your rates are going through the roof.   FYI.,2020-09-21 13:07:07,Twitter Web App,31694,80300

Get well Jahana. And thanks for sharing your story.   But if you want to know why 200000 have died here it is.

The top issue for voters in 2018 was health care. The ACA repeal effort cost Republicans millions of votes.   With a case to repeal the ACA (and replace it with nothing) currently on the Supreme Court docket ACA repeal just became - once again - a defining issue of the election.,2020-09-19 15:12:57,Twitter for iPhone,641,1635
If Republicans push through a Supreme Court nominee within weeks the Affordable Care Act will be gone (a case is pending).  20 million Americans will lose their health insurance and rates will skyrocket for anyone with a preexisting condition.

I was so thrown by this exchange w Redfield yesterday where he basically tells me not to believe my lying eyes. Claims the new rules that clearly dramatically roll back testing actually don’t.

It was like a one day story but it’s just mind blowing that CDC dropped its recommendation that everyone (regardless of symptoms) get tested if they had contact with someone who is COVID positive.

Hey @brianschatz here’s my big idea.  Can we raise $100K (yes $100K) for Steve Bullock?  I checked - the last poll has the Montana Senate race TIED. And it’s the tipping point race.

@joshrogin I don’t know his brief and I’m not arguing it. I was responding to you not him and on a broader point.  My worry is that the “do something” crowd in DC often gets us into huge messes in the ME. Often well intended U.S. intervention there just lengthens conflicts.,2020-09-05 03:18:05,Twitter for iPhone,0,22
@joshrogin I supported the sanctions. But I fear they are barely better than nothing and if they don’t change the calculus of Assad/Russia/Iran at all and they simply hurt civilians then arguably they are worse than nothing.,2020-09-05 03:08:22,Twitter for iPhone,8,52

@joshrogin I also think we do a lot of “America is moral because we did something” box checking. Lightly arming a handful of Syrian rebels was “something” but it made things worse.  Sanctions often fall into this category too. Often they are feckless and just end up hurting non-combatants.,2020-09-04 22:27:27,Twitter for iPhone,21,122
@joshrogin I don’t believe in doing nothing but I also believe that had we shown restraint in the early years of the civil war a whole lot more Syrians would be alive. My point is to be careful about saying that people who preach restraint in the face of evil are immoral.,2020-09-04 22:24:00,Twitter for iPhone,10,98
Saying “do nothing” is different than saying “don’t take inchoherent foolhardy action just to to check the America-is-moral box if the action is going to actually make things worse”.

Let’s be clear about the infamous “red line”.  Obama said he would take action if Assad used chemicals weapons. When Assad did Obama requested Congress approve an attack - AS REQUIRED BY THE CONSTITUTION.   Congress wouldn’t give him approval.

Important to be clear what it means to “fix” U.S. Syria policy. The idea that America can “end the war” reeks of the same kind of hubris that has plagued Middle East policy for decades.

You might ask why does the U.S. need to tell Venezuela's opposition that talk of an invasion is "magical realism"?  Well it's because Donald Trump said invading Venezuela would be "cool".

My god Julie. I'm so sorry.  Thanks to @TheAtlantic for publishing an excerpt from my book from the chapter examining America's suicide epidemic.  In my research I learned this fact:   85% of suicide attempts w a gun end in death.  But for intentional drug overdoses? 3%. https://t.co/sfIyz17MoJ,2020-09-01 15:11:44,Twitter Web App,118,415
This is good news and a model for other universities to follow.

6/ But you do it anyway and you run over people.  You had no good reason to be reckless. You knew the consequences beforehand and did it anyway.  You'd be rightly called a killer.  The difference btwn you and Trump is that you killed 3 or 4. Trump's actions killed thousands.,2020-08-30 14:40:28,Twitter Web App,1142,6274
5/ Think of it this way - say you told your wife you're going to drive to the grocery store and on the way ignore all the stoplights.  You don't have a good reason - you just want to get to the store faster. She tells you before you leave that you're going to get people killed.,2020-08-30 14:40:28,Twitter Web App,641,3578
4/ And they KNOW that masks/social distancing have proven to save lives (see the NIH Director below).  So for no good reason they chose a path that will make it harder to beat COVID and would lead to more people dying. They made this choice consciously.https://t.co/KPO7426sDv,2020-08-30 14:40:28,Twitter Web App,739,3770
3/ He and his advisors KNEW the consequences of brazenly thumbing their nose at their own CDC.  They know viewers follow his example and thus it will now be impossible to convince many people social distancing/masks are important. Bc Trump has made it crystal clear they AREN'T.,2020-08-30 14:40:28,Twitter Web App,696,3840
2/ His RNC speech was his biggest stage. 23m watched.   The question is - WHY did Trump choose not to socially distance guests or require them to wear masks as his own CDC guidelines below recommend?  There seems to be no good reason. He easily could have.https://t.co/Z67RHsoTUG,2020-08-30 14:40:27,Twitter Web App,702,3704
I know what I wrote below sounds harsh. But I stand by it and I want to explain why.  1/ From the start of the epidemic Trump has mostly refused to wear a mask and engage in social distancing.

8/ Yale can't do this themselves. They need the feds - but again the feds are largely AWOL and a great technology may end up helping thousands rather than millions.  Over and over Trump refuses to create a national testing strategy and the virus is the only winner.,2020-08-26 23:34:07,Twitter Web App,91,395
7/ the Trump Administration (here mostly the FDA) feigns impotence. They tell Yale to go find partners themselves instead of showing leadership and taking charge to build the kind of scale that would bring down the cost of the test.,2020-08-26 23:34:07,Twitter Web App,37,286
6/ Lastly what makes this more maddening is that right here in CT we are developing the ability to do population based testing. Yale's Saliva Direct test (I was there this week) is a breakthrough that could provide a cheap easy option with no supply chain issues. But again...,2020-08-26 23:34:06,Twitter Web App,34,229
5/ Again CT doesn't have the ability to build a population based testing program (different from individual tests in that they need to be cheaper but also don't have to be as accurate). Only the federal government - NIH CDC HHS - can create this. And they just haven't done it.,2020-08-26 23:34:06,Twitter Web App,30,202
4/ CT schools are about to reopen but there is no way to do broad population based testing.   So when an outbreak at a school happens we likely won't find out until it's too late (especially since the kids are likely to be asymptomatic).,2020-08-26 23:34:05,Twitter Web App,27,222
3/ Trump has refused to build the additional lab capacity nationally to reduce these wait times. Connecticut can't do it - the testing industry is national. Only HHS and partner federal agencies can expand this capacity but they simply refuse. Outrageous.,2020-08-26 23:34:05,Twitter Web App,44,253
2/ Current turnaround time at New Britain's community health center drive through testing program is 3 days.   3 days is NOT GOOD. That's 3 days for a unknowing positive person to spread.,2020-08-26 23:34:04,Twitter Web App,24,216
Spent some time this week surveying Connecticut's current COVID testing system.  It's made it clear to me how disastrous Trump's refusal to build a national testing plan has been - even in a state like CT that has done COVID response right.  1/ A short THREAD on where we are:,2020-08-26 23:34:04,Twitter Web App,281,898
Yes Trump has put us in a position where our troops are vulnerable and the Russians feel immune from consequence.   But the U.S. should have never been in Syria like this to begin with. We never had a plan to win. We were never willing to go as far as Russia and Iran. https://t.co/KwlYTEleQv,2020-08-26 23:12:52,Twitter for iPhone,207,511

Over our history the position of Secretary of State has remained nobly one level removed from the  political fray.

One week left to pre-order my first book The Violence Inside Us my memoir of violence in America.   Publishers Weekly called it a “wonky but fervent debut”.    That’s good I think.   Order it here: https://t.co/FycZwJpv7I,2020-08-23 23:50:23,Twitter for iPhone,50,261

8/ But remember Belarus is unique - it’s not Ukraine. Lukashenko and Putin have a fraught relationship. Nuanced diplomacy can take advantage of this.  And the protestors aren’t asking to join the EU. So the stakes aren’t as high for Putin here. Again another tactical advantage.,2020-08-23 01:29:59,Twitter for iPhone,139,937
7/ Second make clear to Putin that we will not accept a Kremlin-led military move.   We didn’t see Crimea coming early enough to stop it. We can learn lessons here and take steps (again w Europe) to take a tougher line.,2020-08-23 01:29:59,Twitter for iPhone,149,921
6/ So what should we do?   First work w the Europeans to sanction Lukashenko and key allies.   I’m generally a skeptic of sanctions’ utility but in this case it would be a targeted meaningful sign of which side we are on. But we should only do it with the EU.,2020-08-23 01:29:59,Twitter for iPhone,115,820
5/ Trump has done next to nothing. He hasn’t spoken up on behalf of peaceful protest. He hasn’t called on Putin to stand down. He hasn’t reached out to the EU to craft a joint strategy.   He has left the protestors adrift and this ultimately helps both Lukashenko and Putin.,2020-08-23 01:29:58,Twitter for iPhone,178,864
4/ All this matters because:  a) America should always promote the spread of democracy (more democracies makes the world safer); and   b) our counter Kremlin strategy must involve assuring people living on Russia’s periphery can choose their own fate freely.,2020-08-23 01:29:58,Twitter for iPhone,163,935
3/ Lukashenko has detained and allegedly tortured protestors. Rumors are that Russian forces are readying a big move on his behalf.   The movement hasn’t subsided though. They are demanding Lukashenko’s resignation the release of political prisoners and new elections.,2020-08-23 01:29:58,Twitter for iPhone,136,801
2/ For the last 11 days Belarusians have been engaged in the largest protest for democracy in their country's history after President Lukashenko tried to steal the election. Strikes are crippling the economy and a sense of pride and unity is sweeping the nation.,2020-08-23 01:29:58,Twitter for iPhone,147,962
What’s happening in Belarus matters to U.S. security.

Thank you! The book comes out on 9/1 and pre-orders are really important.  It’s full of interesting stories that tell the story of American violence.

And yes there are very few of us in Congress w young kids.

5/ And it’s a great read! Booklist gave it a “starred” review – reserved for their top reviewed books. Samantha Power said it displays “a historian’s talent for narrative and a memoirist’s gift for introspection”. Good stuff! https://t.co/YmSEpEsEyu,2020-08-13 14:47:27,Twitter Web App,11,73
4/ But publishers and book stores watch pre-orders to decide which books to hype. And for a book to “do well” it really doesn’t take that many people to pre-order it. A few thousand pre-orders can make or break a book.  https://t.co/YmSEpEsEyu,2020-08-13 14:47:27,Twitter Web App,8,42

2/ As I highlighted in a report last year too many college athletes don't have real educational opportunities &amp; far too many especially at big-time programs don't graduate.

@brianschatz Trump installed a guy as his chief of staff whose mission is to destroy government. So maybe I shouldn’t be so surprised when a week of negotiations about how government can help people makes him super uncomfortable and he wants to give up?,2020-08-05 20:02:46,Twitter for iPhone,118,664
Why? Friday isn't a deadline for anything.  People are dying man. Millions others are on the brink of hunger and eviction.

Correct.   I think people think when I said “we organized a coup” I meant I was actually involved. Sometimes I use “we” to just mean “America”.   My whole point was that the attempted coup was a bad idea that set back democracy and harmed America’s credibility. https://t.co/gN7FIDJhhN,2020-08-05 13:42:29,Twitter for iPhone,51,437

10/ It’s a total disaster. After a year and a half Maduro is stronger American influence is weaker and there is no viable path to restore democracy in Venezuela. A case study in international relations malpractice.,2020-08-04 14:30:54,Twitter for iPhone,539,2479
9/ Now having wasted a year trying to work on a transition plan Guaido is boycotting the upcoming legislative elections.   So what then? Keep recognizing Guaido as the nation’s leader even if he doesn’t control the military the government or even hold office?,2020-08-04 14:30:54,Twitter for iPhone,236,1216
8/ Since then it’s been a running comedy of errors. For instance Bolton scuttled promising transition talks led by Norway in August 2019 saying “the time for negotiations is over!” Then this March Pompeo unveiled a transition plan that is a carbon copy of the one we killed.,2020-08-04 14:30:54,Twitter for iPhone,245,1188
7/ Then it got real embarrassing. In April 2019 we tried to organize a kind of coup but it became a debacle. Everyone who told us they’d rally to Guaido got cold feet and the plan failed publicly and spectacularly making America look foolish and weak.,2020-08-04 14:30:53,Twitter for iPhone,1017,2401
6/ In fact the opposite happened. By putting Elliot Abrams (the symbol of “American imperialism” in Latin America) in charge of Venezuela and by acting largely alone Trump helped Maduro rally the military and much of the country against America and cast Guaido as a U.S. pawn.,2020-08-04 14:30:53,Twitter for iPhone,300,1359
5/ Then Trump and his Latin America hawks got itchy. He recognized Guaido as the leader of the nation thinking that would propel Venezuelans (and Maduro-friendly military leaders) to Guaido’s side.,2020-08-04 14:30:53,Twitter for iPhone,210,990
4/ But Trump couldn’t talk to Cuba (bc Obama) Putin had Trump wrapped around his finger and all Trump wanted to talk to China about was the trade deal. So we made no meaningful effort to move them and all three stood solidly behind Maduro.,2020-08-04 14:30:53,Twitter for iPhone,259,1198
3/ The winning play was right in front of us – bring together all of Latin America behind a transition or new free elections and take the time to work with or neutralize Maduro’s patrons (Russia Cuba and to a lesser extent China).,2020-08-04 14:30:53,Twitter for iPhone,234,1108
2/ In early 2019 an opportunity presented itself. Maduro’s reelection was a fraud and the world knew it. The charismatic opposition leader Juan Guaido stood ready to capitalize and restore democracy to the nation.,2020-08-04 14:30:52,Twitter for iPhone,276,1224

I didn't say it was their "only purpose".  Obviously these kids love the game and most love their school and coach.  But that has nothing to do with whether they should get paid.

I'm a huge sports fan. I want college football to come back if it's safe.

7/ Trump will say China isn't in the deal and they sell these kind of drones so we should be able to do it too.  That's false logic. Our drones are far superior and we should never be selling arms into dangerous places just because we want to make a few American companies rich.,2020-07-26 13:39:51,Twitter Web App,198,1013
6/ And by violating the deal it makes it a lot easier for other nations to sell missile technology to our enemies without consequence. If the U.S. isn't complying why should anyone else?  That's terrible for long term U.S. national security interests.,2020-07-26 13:39:51,Twitter Web App,169,757
5/ But Trump so badly wants to sell weaponized drones to places like Saudi Arabia and UAE that he is willing to blow up the deal.  If he does this it dramatically scales up the Middle East arms race (and allows the Saudis to more effectively kill civilians in the Yemen War).,2020-07-26 13:39:51,Twitter Web App,184,734
4/ Luckily a decades-old agreement called the Missile Technology Control Regime makes sure that at the very least this kind of technology can't be sold internationally.

Schools should have security guards if they feel they are necessary. And technology now allows schools to make sure only the right people get inside.   But police facilitate the school-to-prison pipeline with too many misbehaviors ending up as criminal offenses.,2020-06-09 01:33:38,Twitter Web App,174,1296
Nobody takes school safety more seriously than me but police officers don't belong in schools.  Police are supposed to be in schools for safety but for students of color police don't make them feel safe.  e.g. 40% of Virginia students are black. They are 75% of school arrests.,2020-06-09 01:33:38,Twitter Web App,1206,5298
Here's a little thing you can do today: go to this new website - https://t.co/aCnQPhHMDo - and make a donation to remove Mitch McConnell from power.  Elections aren't the only thing.

An Air National Guard RC-26B reconnaissance aircraft circled the DC protests last night. Flight path below.

The issue of federal enforcement officials disguising themselves isn't new.  ICE sends plain clothes officers or officers disguised as local police into communities all the time.

To be clear NO soldiers should be used to clear out or attack peaceful protesters.   It's made worse that some of these officers appear to be wearing no identification.

6/ Doug is to the right of me on guns. He doesn’t support all the things I support. But he also can’t fathom doing nothing. And the gun owners he hunts with agree.   For 20 amazing minutes he made the case that the issue of guns can actually UNITE Americans.,2020-05-26 21:50:47,Twitter for iPhone,13,108
5/ I nervously took my seat the next day for his speech.  What followed was one of the most miraculous speeches I have ever heard in person.   Doug Jones Senator from Alabama speaking truth about guns in America.,2020-05-26 21:50:47,Twitter for iPhone,8,89
4/ I panicked. I went back to my office and told my staff that Doug Jones was giving his first speech on guns.   I assumed that he was going to draw a line in the sand and position himself as the immovable right flank of the debate in the Democratic caucus.,2020-05-26 21:50:46,Twitter for iPhone,8,60
3/ On March 20 2018 he flagged me down - the first time he had sought me out that year.   He said “Chris I’d like you to be on the floor for my maiden speech tomorrow. It’s going to be on a topic you care about - gun violence”.,2020-05-26 21:50:46,Twitter for iPhone,8,69
2/ I hadn’t spent a ton of time w Doug during his first 2 months in the Senate. He seemed thoughtful and earnest and my assumption was that he’d avoid anything controversial. That’s what any political consultant would have told him to do.,2020-05-26 21:50:46,Twitter for iPhone,8,67
1/ I want to tell you a quick story of my first substantive conversation with Doug Jones.   And how no other Senator has done more to show me what the Senate COULD be.

4 reasons to help me and @brianschatz raise $ for Doug Jones tonight:  1. Just a terrific human being. Humble. Decent. Rock solid moral compass.  2. Dems need to compete everywhere.  3.

Good morning.   In the middle of a pandemic that has killed nearly 80000 Americans a normal president would try to expand health insurance.

One weird benefit of Trump is that he’s willing - now more than ever for some reason - to say the quiet things out loud.   Republicans want less people to vote. This is true.

If a 15-20% unemployment rate scares you (and it should) then you need to be equally scared about the lack a national testing plan.  Because the economy can't reopen if we can't test.

5/ So this is a NO BRAINER - in the next Coronavirus relief bill Congress should require the Trump Administration to join CEPI and make a contribution to their work.  Maybe we find a vaccine in the U.S. first - but if a CEPI partner finds it we want be part of the team.,2020-05-05 22:49:03,Twitter Web App,1129,5335
4/ And so when CEPI began work on a vaccine for Coronavirus the United States was left on the outside. This means that if CEPI develops a vaccine it will likely give preference to its members.  The good news - CEPI still wants us as a member. It's not too late.,2020-05-05 22:49:03,Twitter Web App,609,2806

🚨🚨 McConnell bought $2.8M of ads in Montana this month.  Why? Last poll is 47-47. Montana likely decides control of the Senate.  @brianschatz and I want to raise $28000 tonight for our candidate Gov.

McConnell is calling the Senate back in ignoring DC's stay at home order and putting thousands of Capitol employees at risk.  Not to do oversight of Trump's pandemic response.

Kentucky gets $45 BILLION more in federal funding than they pay in taxes.   New York pays $21 BILLION more in taxes than they get from the feds.  So effectively every year NY writes a $21B check to KY.  But helping pay for pandemic response is a blue state bailout.   Got it.,2020-04-27 16:11:54,Twitter Web App,19828,58049

@joshrogin @BillGates @FareedZakaria I listened to the full clip. He should have called out China for their serious mistakes.

6/ Trump's policy of diplomatic withdrawal unilateral economic sanctions and blind non-strategic military escalation has done nothing but play into Iran's hands.  They are stronger We are weaker. And the launch of this satellite is just more proof.,2020-04-23 19:38:18,Twitter Web App,63,273
5/ Iran is stronger nearly everywhere they have proxies.  Trump's pullout from Syria empowered Iranian proxy Assad.  Iran and the Yemeni Houthis are closer than ever.  Hezbollah took control in Lebanon.  And Tehran has more influence in Baghdad than ever before.  Disaster.,2020-04-23 19:38:17,Twitter Web App,58,247
4/ Trump blew up the nuclear deal and promised to build a new system of international pressure to force the Iranians into a new better deal.  Obviously that failed miserably. Nobody signed up for the new sanctions &amp; Iran restarted their nuclear program. And no new better deal.,2020-04-23 19:38:17,Twitter Web App,73,273
3/ Now Iran and their proxies are shooting at U.S. troops on a regular basis. And though Trump told us that the Soleimani killing would deter Iran attacks on U.S. forces have increased not decreased since the Soleimani strike.,2020-04-23 19:38:16,Twitter Web App,53,198
2/ In virtually every way Iran is stronger today in the Middle East and America is weaker than 4 years ago.  First when Trump took office Iran wasn't shooting at U.S. forces in Iraq. Obama had convinced Iran to send their proxies to war WITH us in the fight against ISIS.,2020-04-23 19:38:15,Twitter Web App,64,221

6/ Lastly and most importantly we propose that the next COVID relief package include major emergency funding for special education.

5/ Second we DO believe that states need some flexibility on timelines and reporting.

4/ First we believe DeVos should not waive any basic protections or rights for students w disabilities. There is a push for her to do this by some school districts that have never liked the federal mandates to teach kids w disabilities.,2020-04-22 16:06:24,Twitter for iPhone,18,70

2/ Schools and parents don’t know what to do bc there has been little guidance from Sec. DeVos or Congress. Many schools are providing no extra services to disabled kids at home and aren’t making plans to catch up when school reopens.   This makes the crisis worse.,2020-04-22 16:06:24,Twitter for iPhone,19,81

As best I can understand this is where we’re at:  -Trump refuses to organize a COVID response bc he says it’s up to states and hospitals  -But he opposes funding for states  -And when funding is approved for hospitals it’s a “concession” to Democrats  Do I have that right?,2020-04-21 22:21:37,Twitter for iPhone,2466,7759
I wish it weren’t. But it is.   Trump won’t lift a finger. He just does press conferences. And Republicans are too scared to stand up to him.   So it’s left to congressional Democrats to force the Administration to do the basic blocking and tackling of pandemic  response. https://t.co/KgxzV1729Z,2020-04-21 22:14:50,Twitter for iPhone,614,1930

5/ And what happens when these students come back to school? They will need A LOT of help and resources to catch up.  But school budgets are going to be stretched thin as the recession crashes local budgets. How do schools afford to provide these extra services?,2020-04-18 14:39:58,Twitter Web App,150,1191
4/ Schools are confused about what their obligations are right now. Do they have to adjust the students' learning plan and try to deliver services? Do they plan to give extra help when the student returns? Do they just throw their hands up and give up?  Federal law is unclear.,2020-04-18 14:39:57,Twitter Web App,136,1067
3/ But understandably schools can't provide this help when kids are distance learning.   So lots of these kids are receiving NO education right now. And many have difficultly adjusting to change and new routines and are falling into crisis locked inside with nothing to do.,2020-04-18 14:39:57,Twitter Web App,136,1156
2/ Students with learning disabilities badly want to learn just like their peers but they need specialized plans and extra help. They get it through guarantees in federal law - the IDEA Act.

Nothing I wrote is contradicted by that fact check.  1) WHO produced 1.4m tests; 2) We didn't use it bc Trump decided to develop his own test; 3) He botched the job. All true.

3/ Russia and China are bigger threats than ever before. We shouldn't stand down in the fight against major powers and non-state adversaries.   But are conventional military actors really 100x more dangerous than disease?  The answer of course is staring us in the face today.,2020-04-07 02:45:13,Twitter Web App,154,1282
2/ It's not that we lack the resources to protect America from pandemic disease. It's just that we don't align our spending to the actual threats that America faces today.  Our non-HIV global health budget is about $6B.   This year the Department of Defense will spend $738B.,2020-04-07 02:45:13,Twitter Web App,359,2124
1/ The aircraft carrier Teddy Roosevelt couldn't protect us from a virus. Instead the virus took the massive carrier out of service.  Someday we'll replace the Roosevelt.  The cost of that one new ship will be more than our entire annual anti-pandemic budget.,2020-04-07 02:45:12,Twitter Web App,923,4555

We lost 9000 jobs during the 2007-2009 Great Recession.  We've lost 10000 jobs in two weeks.  And Trump is totally over-matched by this economic crisis.   He has no plan to save us. No ideas. No new programs. All the initiatives so far have come from Congress.,2020-04-06 14:11:32,Twitter Web App,6497,23300

This exchange went largely unnoticed yesterday. But more evidence Trump doesn't understand the science at all.   He believes states should issue stay-at-home orders only once there's been a "massive breakout".

Two months before the Wuhan outbreak Trump shut down the program that identified viruses in China that might spread to the U.S.  Possibly a fatal mistake.  So I've proposed a comprehensive plan to rebuild our global anti-pandemic infrastructure.  https://t.co/t5GqEj3WmB,2020-04-05 13:50:39,Twitter Web App,1823,4641
The U.S. had a program - PREDICT - that identified lethal viruses abroad to prevent their spread to the U.S..   It had found 1200 viruses (and 160 coronaviruses) in 10 years.  It was actively working in China.  Two months before the Wuhan outbreak Trump shut the program down.,2020-04-05 13:46:17,Twitter Web App,45390,85370

The Medical Supply Chain Emergency Act. https://t.co/fH8vbwmAgs,2020-04-02 03:02:15,Twitter for iPhone,2576,7928
6/ The Trump Administration either has to implement a national program or develop and establish a program and then fund the states to implement it.  But right now Trump isn't doing either and worse doesn't seem to care about or understand the danger of inaction.,2020-04-02 02:04:58,Twitter Web App,693,3109
5/ And it's madness to require every state or every country or every city to become overnight experts in TEST TRACK AND QUARANTINE. This is complicated nuanced public health policy.  And having thousands of different conflicting systems makes no sense either.,2020-04-02 02:04:58,Twitter Web App,341,2033
4/ Finally all those people must be quarantined. But for the disabled elderly or people that have to go to work quarantine is really hard.  Taiwan paid people to quarantine. Maybe we don't do that but there must be a system of supports in place to make quarantine feasible.,2020-04-02 02:04:58,Twitter Web App,271,1787
3/ 2nd step is to quickly trace back &amp; find everyone the infected person was in physical contact with. That takes personnel effort and expertise. Other nations didn't just leave it to the individual to do it alone.  But again Trump has no interest in creating this capacity.,2020-04-02 02:04:57,Twitter Web App,300,1881
2/ The first step is to test widely. That might not mean testing the asymptomatic. But it certainly means aggressively testing anyone with symptoms doing it quickly and getting the results quickly.  That's not happening now and Trump has no plan to ramp up.,2020-04-02 02:04:57,Twitter Web App,375,2244
THREAD ON THE PATH FORWARD:  1/ Other countries taught us we cannot turn the corner on coronavirus w/o a comprehensive system of TESTING TRACING and QUARANTINE.  The Trump Administration has zero plan to stand up that system nationally.  That's frightening and it must change.,2020-04-02 02:04:57,Twitter Web App,3923,12506

You cannot beat Coronavirus with a state-by-state city-by-city response with thousands of conflicting strategies.  Only a national plan will work.   And the problem isn't that Trump's doing the wrong things.  The problem is he's effectively doing nothing.,2020-04-01 15:09:06,Twitter Web App,2862,9148
6/ Trump has no actual plan to contain the virus. The virus will grow unless there is a national plan to TEST ISOLATE TRACK AND QUARANTINE.  But this takes a massive public health infrastructure that doesn't exist now. Trump has no plan and no interest in building it.,2020-04-01 15:09:06,Twitter Web App,1586,5400
5/ Every legislative action to fund the public health response and save the economy from total ruin has been driven by Congress.    Trump has no legislative agenda. He asks for no new authorities or new funding. In fact his negotiators mostly argue for less money.,2020-04-01 15:09:06,Twitter Web App,1092,4407
4/ The supply chain for these same supplies has completely broken down into chaos. States and hospitals bid against each other driving prices up. Supplies don't get to areas of greatest need.  Trump could solve this by federalizing the supply chain but he does nothing.,2020-04-01 15:09:06,Twitter Web App,1326,4974
3/ The only way to solve mask test and ventilator shortages is for the feds to organize production.  Trump has this power but he chooses not to use it. His minimalist actions have barely made a dent.  And day after day the shortages continue and Trump does nothing.,2020-04-01 15:09:05,Twitter Web App,1505,5537
2/ All the school business and beach closures have been carried out by states and cities not Trump.  At the very least Trump could incentivize non-compliant or complacent states to enact emergency measures.  But he does nothing except provide weak intermittent guidance.,2020-04-01 15:09:05,Twitter Web App,1347,5929
1/ Hear me out:  If you're criticizing Trump's Coronavirus response as ineffective you're doing it wrong.  The problem is - for all practical purposes - there has been NO RESPONSE.   The Administration has effectively declared surrender.   And 200000 might die because of this.,2020-04-01 15:09:04,Twitter Web App,10832,28481

Yesterday Trump said he "hasn't heard about testing for a week."  It's just shocking how gleefully disconnected from this crisis he is.   Today there aren't enough tests to beat this virus.

In the category of good short term AND long term investment includes:  (1) money to help schools buy laptops for poor kids;  (2) funding to discount data connections for low income households.

5/ But's it's not easy for states to adopt the program (CA is the only one today). Congress and the Administration can take steps in the next emergency aid package to make it easier.  It's a classic win/win.  Less people starve. Less businesses close.,2020-03-17 20:28:44,Twitter Web App,248,1669
4/ Restaurants are closing down. Some can't sustain a two week closure and won't reopen. SNAP customers alone won't solve that problem but the additional business (for those that are open for take out or for when restaurants reopen) certainly would help.,2020-03-17 20:28:44,Twitter Web App,176,1152
3/ With schools and day cares closed food insecurity is going to be an ever bigger crisis now than it was in 2009. No question we need to increase SNAP benefits.  But here's the rub: a little known SNAP rule says states can allow the benefits to be used in restaurants.,2020-03-17 20:28:44,Twitter Web App,190,1191
2/ Research shows that the 2009 stimulus program that got the biggest bang for the buck (ie best ratio of money spent vs. money into Main St. economy) was the expansion of SNAP benefits.

Why have an executive branch if it isn't willing lead at a time like this?   All of these decisions to cancel events close schools or postpone opening days have been made by state local and private sector leaders.  Why is everyone else leading except for our President?,2020-03-12 21:32:30,Twitter Web App,5952,28683
5/ Yesterday's attack showed that Iran (or Iran's proxies) are not scared off by Trump's massive troop deployments.   Bottom line: we shouldn't put troops into the Middle East until we have a plan to protect them.,2020-03-12 20:36:30,Twitter Web App,50,312
4/ For example at Al Asad base in northern Iraq where the January missile attacks occurred we have no Patriot missile system which could have repelled the attack.  The blind escalation with Iran put these troops at risk with no way to adequately protect them.,2020-03-12 20:36:30,Twitter Web App,41,213
3/ Our soldiers are spread all over the Middle East today (Iraq Lebanon Syria Kuwait Qatar Bahrain Saudi Arabia UAE) in a way that makes it nearly impossible to do force protection.  In many places our troops are like sitting ducks.,2020-03-12 20:36:29,Twitter Web App,34,173
2/ Trump ran on pulling the U.S. out of Middle East wars. He has done the opposite. As part of his non-strategic campaign of escalation with Iran he's sent 17000 new troops to the region.  But those troops didn't deter Iran. They (and our existing forces) just became a target.,2020-03-12 20:36:29,Twitter Web App,43,190
1/ I know it's Coronavirus 24/7 but Americans were killed yesterday in Iraq and it's time we started talking about how exposed our forces are today in the Middle East.  Trump's seat-of-the-pants deployment of 17000 new troops to the region was a mistake.   Here's why:,2020-03-12 20:36:29,Twitter Web App,337,1277

1. There is a shortage of the Coronavirus testing reagent.   2. Much of the reagent supply comes from Europe.   3. Pissing off Europe by not giving them prior notice of the travel ban was totally unnecessary.   Cornavirus response is chess. Trump is playing checkers.,2020-03-12 18:01:51,Twitter for iPhone,8842,35502
Some stuff here is hard. This isn’t.   The House Coronavirus bill provides:  - free testing  - aid for medical workers - paid medical leave  - nutrition assistance  - extended unemployment insurance  We don’t need industry bailouts.

President Trump’s claim that America has far less cases than Europe is completely reliant on his unconscionable failure to make tests available.

At a time of crisis it’s inexcusable for the nation’s leader to continually provide false information that further endangers the public.   But it’s just unfathomable to get basic facts wrong during a live national address from prepared remarks.,2020-03-12 12:54:57,Twitter for iPhone,2256,9602

It’s like Trump forgot the “stop the spread of the virus” part and went right to “tax breaks”.   The best way to help the economy is to slow and then halt the virus. No economic stimulus will work as long as the epidemic is expanding.,2020-03-11 00:42:00,Twitter for iPhone,1954,8055

4/ And our negotiators' race to get a deal (against Trump's desire to announce a unconditional withdrawal) took focus off the Afghan election crisis. Now there are two men claiming to be running the country a new disaster.,2020-03-10 02:34:41,Twitter Web App,900,4746
3/ The agreement leaves the Afghan government out to dry by scheduling withdrawal before a Taliban/Afghan gov deal.

It’s just mind blowing that we are two month into this crisis and less than 5000 have been tested.   That is unacceptable.   But it makes sense when you consider that the White House prioritizes “avoiding bad news” over “stopping the epidemic”.,2020-03-10 00:27:10,Twitter for iPhone,5149,18733
I spoke by phone today to CDC Director Redfield. I told him:  1. Connecticut needs more tests. Now. Hard to know how/where to respond if we can't see the virus.  2.

FYI the Saudi price war is all about killing American shale. If they succeed could be bad in places like North Dakota and Texas.

Next week Congress needs to start considering policies that will protect workers (especially hourly workers) in the case of large scale economic disruptions.

10/ 9 months after #HR8 got to the Senate in November 15-year-old Gracie Anne Muehlberger was shot by a classmate with a semiautomatic untraceable "ghost gun" in Santa Clarita CA.

THREAD: Today marks one year since the House passed #HR8 a bill requiring a background check for every gun sale.   In the year Mitch McConnell has refused a vote in the Senate 40000 people have been shot and killed.   I want you to hear a few of their stories. It's important.,2020-02-27 15:13:36,TweetDeck,3591,7705
A year ago today #HR8 the Bipartisan Background Checks Act passed the House.  Since then for 365 days Mitch McConnell has done nothing. No debate. No vote. NOTHING.

Mike Pence is not an upgrade.   Putting a guy in charge of a deadly major pandemic who doesn’t believe in science and thinks smoking doesn’t cause cancer is...well...NOT A GREAT IDEA.   Radical idea: put someone qualified in charge. Take this seriously.,2020-02-27 02:00:49,Twitter for iPhone,9214,37554
This is what we need.   President Trump's $1.5B emergency request is abysmally small. It won't get the job done. But it reflects an Administration that lives in a fantasy world where they think Coronavirus is contained "air tight". https://t.co/X5yeqsIyMs,2020-02-26 16:47:21,Twitter Web App,474,1654
This is extraordinary and underscores why so many of us believe that democracy is at risk.   Trump is saying he is going to fire federal employees (not just political appointees) who oppose him politically.   Dictatorships not democracies require loyalty tests. https://t.co/f0GcnKc6WI,2020-02-26 15:13:54,Twitter for iPhone,5059,11492
Mr. President this is serious and we all need you to be acting like it’s serious.  And for the record Democrats begged you for an emergency funding bill 3 weeks ago and you sat on your hands. https://t.co/T05oxIsjpp,2020-02-26 14:43:45,Twitter for iPhone,1765,6423
Trump has put no one in charge of Coronavirus.  He is pushing cuts to the budgets of all the agencies that fight pandemics.   He shut down 37 of 47 global anti-pandemic programs.   Trump made a choice to make us vulnerable...to this pandemic and the next one and the next one.,2020-02-25 19:00:58,Twitter for iPhone,15814,40070
We absolutely haven’t. But Trump’s belief that Coranavirus is contained explains why they have no plan nobody in charge no real funding request and no international strategy. https://t.co/SC6VV9ns2E,2020-02-25 18:48:38,Twitter for iPhone,607,2003

Our democracy today is like the frog slowly being boiled to death.   The President found out that Russia is secretly trying to help him get re-elected and when the secret leaked he took steps to tighten his grip on the information.

More evidence of Iran’s increasing influence in Lebanon.   In every way Trump’s disastrous Iran policy has empowered Tehran.   Their proxies are more confrontational.

3/ Congress is a co-equal branch to the executive. We set foreign policy too. Many of us have met w Zarif over the years under Obama and Trump.

@brianschatz AND the Administration isn’t asking for any emergency funding. When less than 6 people caught Ebola in the U.S. Obama asked for (and got) $4 billion. That’s how we beat it.

@brianschatz It’s hard to comprehend. Their response to Coronavirus is to literally RAMP DOWN efforts to fight Coronavirus.   A 34% cut would mean massive layoffs of the people who are trying to stop pandemic diseases from hitting the U.S.,2020-02-10 22:09:16,Twitter for iPhone,1252,3100

8/ Now panicking in the face of months of failure the U.S. tried to secretly organize a military coup but we bungled it and it failed miserably and publicly leaving Guaido more isolated and embarrassed than ever before.,2020-02-05 20:38:30,Twitter Web App,145,676
7/ Trump's reversal of the diplomatic thaw with Cuba also meant that there was no way to work with Cuba a huge backer of Maduro to ease an end to the regime.,2020-02-05 20:38:30,Twitter Web App,96,564
6/ But it got EVEN WORSE - Trump appointed Elliott Abrams as our envoy even though most of our Latin American allies viewed Abrams as a proponent of U.S. Western Hemisphere imperialism. Abrams assured to alienate our allies was probably the worst pick possible for this job.,2020-02-05 20:38:29,Twitter Web App,109,628
5/ And then it got worse. Turkey UAE and India in league with Russia sided against the U.S. and constructed a means for Maduro to avoid sanctions. A nuclear meltdown of American diplomacy - the nations that mattered on sanctions were either neutral or actively undermining us.,2020-02-05 20:38:29,Twitter Web App,114,622
4/ Trump's isolation from our allies now began to hurt. We moved to impose sanctions on Maduro but the EU - insulted time and again by Trump - largely wouldn't help. Without Europe our sanctions were at best feckless.,2020-02-05 20:38:28,Twitter Web App,120,632
3/ Some of us counseled holding back recognition of Guaido as leverage to get Maduro to make concessions. But Trump played his most important card on day one leaving him no room to maneuver. Diplomatic malpractice.,2020-02-05 20:38:28,Twitter Web App,113,670
2/ Trump's theory of the case was as simple as it was ignorant of reality: recognize Juan Guaido as the leader of Venezuela and Maduro would just back down. It was an idea not a strategy and it had no hope of working.,2020-02-05 20:38:28,Twitter Web App,110,612
Amazing that Trump tried to put a positive spin on his Venezuela debacle last night.   THREAD: 1/ Here's the real story on how Trump's Venezuela policy has been an utter failure empowering Maduro and weakening the U.S. in our hemisphere and the world.,2020-02-05 20:38:27,Twitter Web App,1052,2610
I'm LIVE sharing my closing thoughts on impeachment ahead of today's vote at 4 PM https://t.co/X97eTFGCoG,2020-02-05 20:21:52,Twitter for iPhone,189,701
I sat silently across the chamber listening to my friend give one of the most important speeches I have ever had the good fortune to hear in person.   At a time when many wonder what honor is left in public life there stands Mitt Romney.,2020-02-05 19:21:22,Twitter for iPhone,10656,69104
Heading down to the Senate floor to outline my final thoughts on impeachment ahead of the vote this afternoon. Turn on C-SPAN 2 to watch live soon.,2020-02-05 18:49:56,TweetDeck,108,999
Trump at #SOTU: "I will protect people with pre-existing conditions"  Also Trump: Supporting a lawsuit to completely overturn protections for pre-existing conditions and kick 20 million people off insurance.,2020-02-05 16:27:39,TweetDeck,874,2608
Last Mookie tweet.   This is an underrated moment from the Sox 2018 World  Series run. Betts throws out the lead runner in the 8th of Game 4 in Houston.  https://t.co/v8efZgEAVa,2020-02-05 15:21:16,Twitter Web App,10,88
Ok this is only for hardcore baseball fans but this is one of the best at-bats you will ever see. 13 pitches. Go-ahead grand slam. And an iconic call by Eck.    One of my favorite Mookie moments.  https://t.co/oHGpNa7wdV,2020-02-05 15:17:51,Twitter Web App,21,145
Just left the Administration briefing on Coronavirus. Bottom line: they aren't taking this seriously enough.   Notably no request for ANY emergency funding which is a big mistake. Local health systems need supplies training screening staff etc. And they need it now.,2020-02-05 15:09:34,Twitter Web App,19202,51214
I can’t believe they traded Mookie. It will hurt the franchise chill interest in the team. Just feels like a middle finger from the Red Sox ownership to the fans. I don’t get it.,2020-02-05 13:47:49,Twitter for iPhone,49,540
This is a MUST READ this morning. Democrats need to go toe to toe with Trump on the economy and stop pretending like his lies are true.  Obama created more jobs.   Wages grew faster before Trump took office.   Manufacturing is doing worse under Trump. https://t.co/gzsUyb6PpC,2020-02-05 13:38:05,Twitter for iPhone,5696,12798
That was a disgrace. I should not have gone.   It was a re-election pep rally from beginning to end filled with political stunts and verifiable lie after verifiable lie.  I get it - presidents use their last SOTU to make the case for re-election. But that crossed a line.,2020-02-05 03:41:09,Twitter for iPhone,10700,61334
It’s just nonsense to think that Trump has learned from his mistakes.   When Rudy went back to Ukraine in December - in the middle of impeachment - to dig up more dirt Trump called him seconds after his plane landed to find out what he got.   He’s still doing it.,2020-02-04 23:32:43,Twitter for iPhone,3722,13261
Awesome. Thanks for the advice.   FYI you carried my fantasy baseball team from 03-05. Good times. https://t.co/uSnh6k9OBv,2020-02-04 23:28:15,Twitter for iPhone,49,1109
I'm honored to have Deborah Davis from Mothers United Against Violence in Hartford joining me for tonight's State of the Union. #SOTU https://t.co/hy1i8VEkNI,2020-02-04 19:04:31,TweetDeck,90,618
3 things that should happen ASAP to protect the U.S. from Coronavirus:  1. Trump should reinstate the NSC anti-outbreak position he eliminated.  2. Trump should reverse plans to slash pandemic disease funding.  3. Congress should pass an emergency funding bill this month.,2020-02-04 18:02:18,Twitter Web App,975,3004
Trump proposed slashing pandemic disease funding.  He eliminated the White House position dedicated to protecting the nation from outbreaks.  He gutted and demoralized our diplomatic corps.  We could have been ready for Coronavirus.   Trump has left us vulnerable.,2020-02-04 17:59:57,Twitter Web App,3855,10050
My 11 year just nearly had a heart attack when he saw the exit polls in Iowa saying health care was the number one issue.   “Not climate change?” he moans. “It’s like the the house is on fire and all people care about is doing renovations.”,2020-02-04 01:17:59,Twitter for iPhone,9391,68159
Happy Sunday.   What’s the point of the impeachment power if not to protect against a president who tries to use the massive power of his office to bribe a foreign power into helping his re-election?,2020-02-02 14:00:44,Twitter for iPhone,1858,10479
But it’s a “peace plan”. I mean it’s in the TITLE. What gives? https://t.co/YCHZqHKeT7,2020-02-01 21:25:53,Twitter for iPhone,427,3149
7/ This is a CRAZY view of the world (I'm just explaining not excusing) but I think it's important for everyone to see the prism through which many Rs (not all) view impeachment.  For both D and R Senators the trial is about threats to democracy. We just see different threats.,2020-02-01 02:06:35,Twitter Web App,1089,7815
6/ Republicans don't love Trump but they do believe that if they don't stand up to this deep state/media cabal RIGHT NOW then they set a precedent that will allow this same conspiracy to take down every future Republican president.,2020-02-01 02:06:34,Twitter Web App,657,3903
5/ You see many Republicans don't think any self respecting conservative would EVER work for government or the mainstream media so all these people testifying and breaking stories MUST be Democrats and they must have political agendas.,2020-02-01 02:06:34,Twitter Web App,650,4241
4/ For them this trial is ALSO about evidence of the most serious threat to democracy - an anti-Trump whistleblower working with secret Republican-hating Democratic civil servants backed by the liberal media attempting to take down a conservative Republican president.,2020-02-01 02:06:34,Twitter Web App,635,4002
3/ Many (most?) Republicans as shown in Sen. Alexander's statement also think Trump is reckless and dangerous.   But what you need to understand is that they think there exists a MUCH bigger threat to democracy than Trump - the deep state/media elite conspiracy.,2020-02-01 02:06:33,Twitter Web App,772,4844
2/ Democrats like the majority of Americans view Trump as a threat to democracy and this trial put on evidence of the most serious example of this threat - his use of his official powers to destroy his political rivals and cheat in an election.,2020-02-01 02:06:33,Twitter Web App,923,6079
1/ For tonight's impeachment behind-the-scenes something different:   I want to tell you my theory about why Democrats and Republicans are on different planets during this trial. I want to tell you why we could only get 2 R votes today against a rigged trial. This is important.,2020-02-01 02:06:33,Twitter Web App,3773,11982
Filmed this a year ago as I was heading abroad to advocate for the preservation of the Good Friday Agreement.  While Brexit is still a raw deal for our natl. security the EU and the Western alliance I'm encouraged that there are more protections in place for Northern Ireland. https://t.co/WlnBr56Vik,2020-01-31 17:58:04,Twitter Media Studio,61,242
This seems important. Guiliani essentially saying the meeting Bolton describes - and Trump denies - happened.   “I wouldn’t call it making it up.” https://t.co/6otvi2uwCr,2020-01-31 17:47:57,Twitter for iPhone,807,2306
Bolton's story is going to come out. Republicans can't stop that.  Thus the purpose of keeping his story hidden NOW is to make sure voters don't have the information in time to pressure their Senator on the impeachment vote.  That's why this is a cover up.,2020-01-31 14:27:04,Twitter Web App,3781,13301
It’s simple really.   If the trial is rigged to keep hidden the most damming most important most relevant evidence then it’s not a trial.   Nor is it an acquittal.   It’s a coverup.   If this is what happens tomorrow the Senate will be disgraced.,2020-01-31 04:26:27,Twitter for iPhone,14324,54769
7/ I gave my first question of the away to a Senator who hadn't asked a good one yet and then by the time I wrote a new one I liked (on the importance of Bolton's testimony) the clock had run out (I was the next question up at adjournment). But here it is in case you care: https://t.co/GHWVXrbvxc,2020-01-31 04:11:53,Twitter Web App,200,1599
6/ Manchin has chocolate milk! This is a big deal because it suggests that the rules might allow things to be added to milk. I tell Manchin he should be really careful about the precedent he just set because there's a lot more powerful additives available than chocolate sauce.,2020-01-31 04:11:49,Twitter Web App,122,1435
5/ Let me just note for all of you who still remember we have a Democratic presidential primary in four days that all the Dem Senators who are running are getting along swimmingly. Lots of chatter between Amy Elizabeth Bernie and Michael during the breaks in action.,2020-01-31 04:11:49,Twitter Web App,187,1701
4/ The second question of the day is from Rand Paul and Roberts rejects it. I notice that he reads Paul's question first to himself (something he never does) so maybe he got tipped off that Paul's question was way out of line?,2020-01-31 04:11:48,Twitter Web App,131,1271
3/ Huh - no Dershowitz at the President's counsel's table. My fingers are crossed they banned him after the crazy dangerous argument he made last night about a president's immunity if he abuses his power to secure his reelection.,2020-01-31 04:11:48,Twitter Web App,152,1383
2/ A reporter from the Boston Globe (Go Sox!) called me this morning to talk about how novel these behind-the-scenes threads are. She filed this story (in which I learned that I've gained 30000 followers since the beginning of the trial!) https://t.co/AMLwrK2qa7,2020-01-31 04:11:47,Twitter Web App,167,1397

Thank you for your leadership on this @RepBarbaraLee.  This is a huge step toward reasserting Congress's constitutional authority over matters of war.  The Senate should take this up immediately. https://t.co/Yn1H1Jdjzj,2020-01-31 00:36:35,Twitter for iPhone,203,1084

Even if Republicans believe that the House should have called Bolton they cannot deny that two huge things have changed :  1/ Bolton was refusing to testify in House; he’s willing testify in Senate  2/ We now know he has relevant explosive information to share.,2020-01-30 17:54:47,Twitter for iPhone,1483,5238
To me the most damning evidence is this:  If Trump was really concerned about corruption he would have referred Zelensky to the people in his Administration who work on corruption.  But he told Zelensky to call Rudy the guy who works only on the President's reelection.,2020-01-30 16:59:06,Twitter Web App,4575,14601
Just like Trump didn't care about Burisma until Biden was running no GOP Senator raised an issue about Biden and the entire U.S. government working to get Shokin fired when it was happening.  https://t.co/uPZzdawvEj,2020-01-30 16:53:59,Twitter Web Client,1303,3240
The president's lawyers keep saying that Zelensky felt no pressure from Trump.  That's simply not true.  When Sen. Johnson and I met with Zelensky last fall the Ukrainian president did not dispute that he was being pressured and promised not to interfere in U.S. elections. https://t.co/xfYe4N5vvo,2020-01-30 16:15:47,Twitter for iPhone,1312,3272
You said as long as the President doesn’t commit a crime he can abuse his power in any way he likes in service of his re-election. He can trade taxpayer aid for foreign interference. He can sick law enforcement on his political rivals.   I was there. That’s what you said. https://t.co/zwX4STei1E,2020-01-30 15:16:14,Twitter for iPhone,4658,16479
9/ The trial ends at 11. I run over and do a quick appearance on @11thHour on @MSNBC and head back to the office.   I run into @SenJohnThune in the elevator. “John I never knew you could get so tired from just sitting on your ass 10 hours.”,2020-01-30 05:04:42,Twitter for iPhone,141,2352
8/ With 15 minutes to go I finally get to ask my question. Sekukow smacks it down reserving the right to contest Bolton and other witnesses in court for months. This is their game - threaten the Senate with endless delays if we dare try to seek the truth. https://t.co/Y5fpB25de2,2020-01-30 05:04:42,Twitter for iPhone,494,2639
7/ Right before the final break the Presidents team makes another novel argument: that there’s nothing wrong with getting political dirt on your election opponents from a foreign nation. I wonder whether the late hour is causing his folks to get sloppy.,2020-01-30 05:04:41,Twitter for iPhone,205,1992
6/ I scribble down my question as legibly as I can and hand it Schumer’s staff. They agree that it’s a good question and they send it to get typed up. I wonder if my staff will be sore that we worked for hours on questions and now I wrote a new one in 5 seconds. Improvisation! https://t.co/HzVpt9aWAP,2020-01-30 05:04:40,Twitter for iPhone,102,1693
5/ Schiff says that the House managers will commit to not appealing any rulings by Roberts on witnesses and documents. This would be a way to quicken testimony. So I decide to ask the President’s team if they would commit to the same.,2020-01-30 05:04:39,Twitter for iPhone,142,1623
4/ I have a list of like 5 questions I want to ask. I’ve given them to Schumer and his team so they can group the questions in some logical order. But halfway through the day Schiff says something that changes my mind.,2020-01-30 05:04:39,Twitter for iPhone,102,1324
3/ Dershowitz is clearly made for TV and I guess that’s why Trump insists that he get so much time. But every time he gets up he makes a new crazy argument. Today: anything the President does to get re-elected is by definition unimpeachable. Yikes.,2020-01-30 05:04:38,Twitter for iPhone,258,2743
2/ It’s now day 8 and habits are loosening up in the Senate chamber. More side conversations more milling about. I even heard about some Senators sneaking some pleasure reading onto their desks.,2020-01-30 05:04:38,Twitter for iPhone,101,1259
Welcome to my daily behind-the-scenes thread on the impeachment trial.   1/ I have a vague recollection that my day started w a meeting w the Amtrak CEO (my work on other stuff doesn’t stop) but my memory is hazy after 8 hours and 100 questions.,2020-01-30 05:04:38,Twitter for iPhone,765,4168
It’s all out in the open now.   The President’s counsel just argued that there is nothing wrong with any candidate for office soliciting dirt on their opponents from foreign countries.   They’re not even trying to fake it anymore.,2020-01-30 03:04:33,Twitter for iPhone,15801,55813
The President’s new argument today that anything he does to benefit his re-election no matter how corrupt is unimpeachable is   B A N A N A S,2020-01-29 21:00:53,Twitter for iPhone,6055,30128
I refuse to turn the Senate into an accomplice of the President by using the impeachment proceedings to help him further attack his political opponents. https://t.co/omiQHYXQXj,2020-01-29 04:39:00,Twitter Web App,905,4686
For the record I was for impeachment when President Tyler used aid to the Principality of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt to get them to investigate Henry Clay.  No wait...double checking...  Nope I’m wrong. No other president used foreign aid to try to destroy his political opponents. https://t.co/eh7EecbTBw,2020-01-28 23:41:34,Twitter for iPhone,1177,5374
4/ I remain a devoted supporter of Israel and our commitment to their security and defense. But this proposal compromises the long term security of both Israel and the United States. That's why I oppose it.,2020-01-28 17:25:03,Twitter Web App,2135,14079
3/ The unilateral annexation of the Jordan River valley and existing settlements deemed illegal under U.S. and international law will set back the peace process decades. And it risks real violence and massive destabilization inside places like Jordan.,2020-01-28 17:25:03,Twitter Web App,2013,11298
2/ Any claim that this plan envisions a Palestinian state is just false. The plan allows Israel to control all security matters inside the Palestinian "state" and thus it's not a state at all.,2020-01-28 17:25:03,Twitter Web App,2053,11696
1/ This plan was negotiated with no one but the Israelis and thus it's not a peace plan at all. Peace can only be achieved through agreement between Israel and the Palestinian people. By setting these new terms it makes it harder for Israel to compromise later.,2020-01-28 17:25:02,Twitter Web App,2690,14524
I met this morning at the White House with Jared Kushner and Ambassador Friedman. I appreciate the meeting. I gave them my unvarnished opinion on their so-called "peace plan" which in reality is a total abandonment of decades of U.S. Middle East policy.  Here's what I told them:,2020-01-28 17:25:02,Twitter Web App,10857,35254
The Presidents defense thus far hopscotches back and forth among   - he didn’t do it  - he did do it because the Bidens - he did do it and it’s unimpeachable - Schiff is mean - the bunker  But no denial that his entire Ukraine team was working on aid-for-investigations.,2020-01-28 13:29:13,Twitter for iPhone,2052,8527
America has never been weaker. We have never had less influence. Not even our closest ally Britain with a Trump soulmate in Downing Street listens to us anymore. https://t.co/yvM1ZORtgS via @NYTimes,2020-01-28 13:23:40,Twitter for iPhone,437,1197
8/ At the end of the day I have one more goal - find Jayvon Eason. The new class of Senate pages started today and I nominated Jayvon an honors student from Waterbury to the post. I find him and we chat for a few. "Quite the first day of work" I tell him.,2020-01-28 04:09:37,Twitter Web App,223,4425
7/ At dinner I do a quick @MSNBC appearance and then I tell a gathering of reporters that that Senate Democrats would be "co-conspirators" with Trump if we allowed the Senate floor to become a forum for his Biden-trashing operation. I'm hot about this and I let it show.,2020-01-28 04:09:37,Twitter Web App,384,4161
6/ Pam Bondi and the other Trump lawyers spend most of the day savaging the Bidens (as expected) and it become crystal clear to me: Trump is trying to use the trial to do what Ukraine wouldn't - destroy his political rivals.,2020-01-28 04:09:37,Twitter Web App,1297,5961
5/ You could hear a pin drop as Ken Starr has the gall to lecture the Senate on how the "age of impeachment" has been so dangerous for America. Mouths hang open on the Democratic side. A famous Alanis Morissette song rattles around in my head.,2020-01-28 04:09:36,Twitter Web App,495,4890
4/ As the testimony starts I lean over an apologize to @ewarren about the bad cough I picked up (from one my kids no doubt) over the weekend. It's going to be pretty annoying to sit next to me today but she's a good sport.,2020-01-28 04:09:36,Twitter Web App,170,2631
3/ As the trial begins I start getting asked by press about a proposal by my friend @SenToomey to pair Bolton's testimony with testimony from Hunter Biden. I tell reporters it sounds like a bad idea.,2020-01-28 04:09:36,Twitter Web App,186,2396
2/ I've kept in touch with my Republicans Senate friends over the weekend and I know the few wanting witnesses were on the verge of losing the case. I wonder if the Bolton news is too late with too many GOP Senators resolved to speed the trial to an end.,2020-01-28 04:09:35,Twitter Web App,229,2487
Day 2 of the President's impeachment case. My nightly behind-the-scenes report:  1/ Last night I'm doing the grocery shopping and my phone starts lighting up. @brianschatz is the first to text me about the Bolton story. I read it mouth agape in the middle of the cereal aisle.,2020-01-28 04:09:35,Twitter Web App,1475,8124
The Republican plan to defend the President from an illogical aid quid pro quo is an illogical witness quid pro quo. https://t.co/joKY5ZGMmu,2020-01-27 20:02:10,Twitter for iPhone,237,1046
This argument that the security aid hold is ok because once he got caught he released it is fabulous.   If the police rescue the hostage from the shed in your backyard you still get put in jail for kidnapping.,2020-01-27 19:59:55,Twitter for iPhone,2871,11380

Day 6 of the trial. Bolton willing to confirm the high crime. An upcoming vote on witnesses. A lot to unpack.  I’ll be live on Twitter in a bit to answer your questions. Drop them below ⬇️,2020-01-27 14:25:48,Twitter for iPhone,823,5794
For months there just hasn’t been any question what happened.   But Republicans hung on to the idea that if they kept Trump’s top people from testifying they could plausibly deny he was behind it all.   The game is now up. Their coverup has fallen apart.   BOLTON MUST TESTIFY.,2020-01-27 00:38:31,Twitter for iPhone,7828,30151
There is no pretense left. There are no excuses remaining.   Now with Bolton ready to definitely confirm Trump’s high crime every Republican who refuses to hear his testimony lands a potentially mortal blow to the rule of law in America. https://t.co/h2EK5kI6SM,2020-01-27 00:31:31,Twitter for iPhone,2224,7138
What these brave Senate Republicans threatening to call Schiff and Biden as witnesses won’t tell you is that they are going to vote AGAINST calling witnesses.   The threats are just for show.,2020-01-26 14:04:37,Twitter for iPhone,3083,12634
By saying over and over that we’ve heard limited evidence from people who spoke directly to Trump about this conspiracy the president’s lawyers actually helped MAKE our case to hear from witnesses. https://t.co/kZDvv5QG7I,2020-01-25 22:34:42,Twitter Media Studio,595,2332
These guys think the law doesn’t apply to them.   These guys think they are immune from oversight.   These guys think the free press is a nuisance.   These guys are a threat to democracy.,2020-01-25 22:18:12,Twitter for iPhone,4126,16827
“Do you think Americans care about Ukraine?” angrily barks the chief diplomat of the President who is defending himself against impeachment by trying to prove he cares about Ukraine.,2020-01-25 22:15:03,Twitter for iPhone,1487,6314

4/ The POTUS team's focus on when Ukraine learned of the aid hold was curious. Sure maybe they didn't learn until Aug. 28th but once they learned it became clear that the aid was dependent on the investigations. Why does it matter when the quid pro quo began?,2020-01-25 18:00:35,Twitter Web App,104,1368
3/ I thought the President's lawyers made a compelling case for witnesses. They said little testimony exists of first hand contact with POTUS. That's true bc the White House has refused to allow people who regularly talk to the president (Mulvaney Pompeo etc) to testify.,2020-01-25 18:00:35,Twitter Web App,291,2072
2/ A happy coincidence - walking over the Capitol I ran into my research partner on my upcoming book on violence in America. She is in town to watch the trial. "As an American I just couldn't miss this" she noted.,2020-01-25 18:00:34,Twitter Web App,49,1033
Short day of testimony so short behind the scenes thread.  1/ Definitely a palpable nervousness as the POTUS lawyers began. Many Dem Senators were worried that their tone would be abrasive and over-the-top. It wasn't. That's a good thing. But will it continue?,2020-01-25 18:00:34,Twitter Web App,304,2044
It’s just 100% unacceptable to lie about battle injuries. Trump’s disregard for the truth is infecting the entire government.   The Department of Defense is full of good dedicated public servants. They need to fix this now. https://t.co/59tEDSBhIC,2020-01-25 14:07:50,Twitter for iPhone,1554,4824
Let’s be clear - Come hell or high water Republicans were going to find something the House managers said that outraged them:  (1) to get the media to be distracted from the substance ✅  (2) to justify voting against he managers’ case w/o having to deal w the merits ✅ https://t.co/xOJMjvlTme,2020-01-25 14:04:12,Twitter for iPhone,944,3939
7/ After Schiff wraps I do a quick @andersoncooper appearance and then head back to my office to work on my questions for the trial managers. The trial may be 8 hours a day but the work before and after takes just as long.,2020-01-25 02:53:32,Twitter Web App,246,3888
6/ During Schiff's closing he references the Trump confidante who said GOP defectors would get their heads "on a pike". It's the first time the GOP audibly grumbles during the entire trial. But c'mon- like it's totally implausible that one of Trump's sycophants would say that?,2020-01-25 02:53:31,Twitter Web App,352,3582
5/ At the dinner break I head over for an interview with @MSNBC. But they don't put me on immediately and I panic worrying that the trial will restart while I'm on the air (a definite no-no). I tug out my earpiece and rush back to the chamber. Sorry for ditching you @AriMelber!,2020-01-25 02:53:30,Twitter Web App,188,2893
4/ During breaks my Senate colleagues want to know more about my trip to Ukraine. I tell them how impressive Zelensky is as a real reformer and how tragic it is that at the exact moment we had a guy we could work with we cut his legs off.,2020-01-25 02:53:29,Twitter Web App,363,3087
3/ Crow introduces more information about my meeting with Zelensky in their presentation - this time it's my argument to Zelensky to stay out of American politics. Trump attacked me for this in the fall saying that I not him was the one trying to corruptly influence Zelensky.,2020-01-25 02:53:28,Twitter Web App,256,2450
2/ The cover up is the early focus today.   I know a lot about it because I was in the middle of it. I went to Ukraine in September got briefed by the State Department and no one told me about the quid pro quo. If it was legit policy they wouldn't have hid it from me.,2020-01-25 02:53:27,Twitter Web App,426,3407
House managers' case is closed. My nightly behind-the-scenes account follows:  1/ A half an hour into testimony I start feeling regret for working out this morning. For some reason morning workouts make me more tired during the day. Today isn't a good day to be tired.,2020-01-25 02:53:27,Twitter Web App,1058,6292
I’m gonna let you in on a secret.  Republicans who don’t want to defend Trump’s corruption on the merits are instead going to complain about how mean the House managers are.,2020-01-25 02:08:15,Twitter for iPhone,3460,16360
Iran attacked us and 34 Americans were injured. The Administration covered it up to claim they “restored deterrence” against Iran.   They were right to deescalate but they shouldn’t have made stuff up to justify it. https://t.co/793Oc750gz,2020-01-24 17:56:22,Twitter for iPhone,546,1827
Remember there is no anxiety or fear or anger that you are feeling right now that cannot be cured by political action.  There are great candidates in every corner of the country right now who want to end this corruption that NEED YOUR HELP.  Don’t just be mad. Do something.,2020-01-24 13:53:24,Twitter for iPhone,1470,4396
Sometimes people suggest that I’m overreacting when I worry that our democracy is crumbling underneath our feet right now.   But this is why. https://t.co/D1wSggOjO3,2020-01-24 13:51:20,Twitter for iPhone,992,2900
What if a judge and a defendant conspired at the beginning of a criminal trial and decided that the prosecutor wouldn’t be allowed to call the witnesses that saw the defendant commit the crime?  The judge would be disbarred of course.  But that’s what’s happening here.,2020-01-24 13:47:44,Twitter for iPhone,4173,13033
6/ Man Schiff's closing was powerful. Senators' egos don't tend to allow gushing over other politicians' performance but as we walked out the trial tonight Senator after Senator (albeit the Dem ones) were awestruck. Schiff is right - Trump doesn't care about us just himself.,2020-01-24 04:02:51,Twitter Web App,1048,7471
5/ Chatting with @SenatorMenendez and @SenJeffMerkley during a break we agreed how crystal clear the facts are now. It just seems implausible that any Senator can believe that this scheme didn't happen. All that's left is whether it deserves removal from office.,2020-01-24 04:02:51,Twitter Web App,426,3807
4/ I brought my phone into the chamber today by accident. It was only for a few minutes before I realized my mistake (and I didn't turn it on). I may be in Senate prison by tomorrow but I feel better having admitted my crime.,2020-01-24 04:02:50,Twitter Web App,229,3715
3/ Felt today like pressure was building inside the GOP caucus to close ranks on witnesses/documents. Chatter on the floor that McConnell is pushing hard to stifle all GOP dissent. It's sickening that this trial could turn into a cover up. But we aren't giving up!,2020-01-24 04:02:50,Twitter Web App,523,4199
2/ I thought Nadler's opening seminar on the history of the impeachment clauses was a tour de force. He closed the case on whether you need to prove a crime (you don't) and if foreign entanglements mattered most to the framers (they did). Lots of Senators agreed he nailed it.,2020-01-24 04:02:50,Twitter Web App,418,3922
1/ THREAD: My wife picked a hell of a week to travel for work. It's 11pm and we just finished today's trial. Our babysitter needs to get some sleep so tonight's behind-the-scenes account of the trial will be quick!,2020-01-24 04:02:49,Twitter Web App,1040,6453
The country is not going to accept the first impeachment trial in the history of the nation with no witnesses. It’s just not.   Because that’s not a trial. It’s a coverup.,2020-01-24 01:22:34,Twitter for iPhone,10264,45095
There is more than one really important thing happening tonight. https://t.co/Wpa3mPgBwk,2020-01-24 00:08:43,Twitter for iPhone,30,331
Trump’s national security catastrophes don’t take the impeachment trial off.   News today that the counter-ISIS mission is STILL not back up and running.   ISIS has now had almost a month to regroup and mount attacks against America and its allies.,2020-01-23 17:51:13,Twitter for iPhone,445,1194
The Trump Administration has regularly abused classification rules to hide information the public and public servants should know.   - the Trump/Zelensky call - the Pence/Zelensky call - the Iran War Powers notification  This is unacceptable and unconstitutional. Period. Stop.,2020-01-23 17:37:48,Twitter for iPhone,1840,5446
Just left the secure room having read the classified document regarding VP Pence’s Sept 18 call w Zelensky.   1. Nothing in it is classified. It should be made part of the public record immediately.   2. Hiding evidence of wrongdoing through bogus classification is unacceptable.,2020-01-23 17:14:54,Twitter for iPhone,22433,69789
9/ Finally today was the day that I became part of the trial. Around 8pm @RepZoeLofgren puts the notes of my September meeting w Zelensky into the record. I’m part of history now.   Night!,2020-01-23 05:05:41,Twitter for iPhone,485,7321
8/ I’m struck by how good speech cadences can make long remarks much easier to listen to. @RepJeffries and @RepValDemings are especially good at varying their pacing as they go along. They are both impressive speakers.,2020-01-23 05:05:41,Twitter for iPhone,411,5325
7/ I let @ewarren on to my new impeachment trick. During the short breaks unwrap a few hard candies and put them in your desk drawer. That way you avoid the noise of unwrapping them when you sneak one mid-trial.,2020-01-23 05:05:41,Twitter for iPhone,294,4577
6/ Schiff and the managers are kicking ass. So prepared. Such good storytellers. Their use of video is especially sharp. I wonder if some of my GOP colleagues are seeing this Sondland and Taylor testimony for the first time.,2020-01-23 05:05:40,Twitter for iPhone,589,5926
5/ I’m thinking today as I look across to the Republican side how many of these Senators campaigned hard against Trump in the primary. So many of them warned how out of control he would be.  And now they are readying to green light his corruption. Corruption they saw coming.,2020-01-23 05:05:40,Twitter for iPhone,1537,7194
4/ Milk is the big news today. Senate rules allow Senators to have water or milk at their desks and today Senators (including my seat mate @ewarren) are going w milk. I stick w flat water (and a secret Diet Mtn Dew in the back room fridge).,2020-01-23 05:05:40,Twitter for iPhone,226,3259
3/ I spend a little time catching up w the pages as the trial begins. They are high schoolers who spend a semester working in the Senate. This is exam week so they got home at 3am last night and had an exam first thing this a.m.. So I have no right to complain about being tired.,2020-01-23 05:05:39,Twitter for iPhone,333,4015
2/ All the other crises don’t stop for impeachment. I spent the morning at the CBS News bureau talking about Trump’s dangerous failure to be straight w America about the intel and injuries surrounding the Iran strikes. https://t.co/RNgGQPLZ0n,2020-01-23 05:05:39,Twitter for iPhone,585,4041
1a/ You cannot use the massive powers of the Oval Office to destroy your political rivals. FYI.   1b/ Time for tonight’s behind the scenes rundown of today’s impeachment proceedings.,2020-01-23 05:05:38,Twitter for iPhone,3126,14730
We can’t let impeachment distract us from this ongoing scandal. The Administration is playing dangerously fast and loose with the truth about the Iran strikes.   We need answers. And we can’t wait.  https://t.co/RNgGQPLZ0n,2020-01-23 03:31:53,Twitter for iPhone,1087,3550
This is a tried and true Republican tactic. They used to do this all the time w Pelosi - claim they they were voting a particular way because she was mean to them.   It’s BS - just a way to try to build cover for a reckless vote. https://t.co/oNL8hPMhY4,2020-01-22 17:57:33,Twitter for iPhone,1325,4328
I’m not sure which is more  infuriating -   that the Trump Administration lied and claimed that there weren’t injuries in the Iran missile strike   or   that once caught Trump called the traumatic brain injuries “headaches”,2020-01-22 17:40:04,Twitter for iPhone,5103,16816
Democrats should stop letting Trump get away with these lies about the economy.   The truth:   Over 1 million more jobs were created during Obama’s last 3 years than Trump’s first 3. Job growth is SLOWING.  And deficits are SPIRALLING. Over $3 trillion in new debt under Trump.,2020-01-22 14:20:10,Twitter for iPhone,6316,14421
8/ We wrap at 2am. McConnell could have sent us home at a reasonable hour and reconvened Wednesday but he’s happy to have as much of this trial happen in the dead of night as possible. Get ready for more of this.   Ok I’m off to get a few hours of sleep.,2020-01-22 07:23:15,Twitter for iPhone,1701,13577
7/ It’s so heartbreaking to spend all night enduring Republicans’ stonewalling of a fair trial. We lose every single roll call even the one to just give the managers more than 120 minutes to provide written responses to motions. McConnell keeps his folks in line on every vote.,2020-01-22 07:23:15,Twitter for iPhone,1124,7826
6/ As it gets late both sides start to get overly chippy and personal. I’m alarmed at how often the parties are directly addressing each other. Neither the managers nor the President’s lawyers are on trial. Trump is.   Good for Roberts for stepping in gently.,2020-01-22 07:18:17,Twitter for iPhone,657,7707
5/ The contrast between the preparedness of the House managers and the POTUS team is striking. Schiff and his team carefully build their case w prepared remarks choreographed with video. Cipollone and his lawyers seem to be winging it mostly. Kind of wild to watch.,2020-01-22 07:10:26,Twitter for iPhone,1235,9740
4/ During another break a Republican who is tempted to vote for witnesses later in the trial flags me down to warn that too many votes on witnesses tonight might scare off other like minded Republicans. I hear my colleague out. I want to keep these lines of communication open.,2020-01-22 07:07:38,Twitter for iPhone,678,6860
