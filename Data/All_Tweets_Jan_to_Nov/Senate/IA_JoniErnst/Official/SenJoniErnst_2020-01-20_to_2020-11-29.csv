#ICYMI: Senate Democrats blocked Sarah’s Law—my commonsense bill that would put an end to tragedies like what happened to Iowan Sarah Root on January 31 2016. https://t.co/Vh8EyIoeCk,2020-08-06 20:40:47,Twitter Media Studio,46,108
Sarah’s Law is about justice – for families like the Roots who saw the death of their daughter at the hands of an illegal immigrant. Today I called on my Senate colleagues to pass my bill that would hold criminals like Sarah's killer accountable for their actions. https://t.co/u5n7N7tXK2,2020-08-06 19:08:24,Twitter Media Studio,62,112

I intend to fulfill that promise to Sarah’s loving parents – Michelle Root and Scott Root – the promise that I will do everything I can to ensure that not one more parent has to go through what the Roots have faced…the loss of both their daughter and the promise of justice.,2020-08-06 15:17:21,Twitter Web App,3,10
This bill isn’t about the southern border or the wall or visa numbers or the larger immigration debate at all…this bill is about changing the system for the better and ensuring that families have the promise of justice.,2020-08-06 15:16:49,Twitter Web App,0,10
Despite provisions of Sarah’s Law being put in place by executive order it is critical that the Senate codify these enforcement priorities so that they cannot be removed by future administrations.,2020-08-06 15:15:59,Twitter Web App,3,8
Here’s a bit of good news: President Trump implemented parts of Sarah’s Law through an executive order in 2017 including directing the Secretary of Homeland Security to prioritize the removal of violent criminals.,2020-08-06 15:15:37,Twitter Web App,3,7
Sarah’s Law is about as commonsense a reform as there is. It recognizes the simple fact that all criminals should be held accountable for their actions and not simply allowed to slip back into the shadows.,2020-08-06 15:15:05,Twitter Web App,1,3
Sarah’s Law is simple: it requires that ICE take custody of a person who is in the country illegally if they are charged w/ a crime that seriously injures another person.,2020-08-06 15:14:39,Twitter Web App,2,12
Today I rise to call upon my Senate colleagues to end this senseless madness. To do something and stop another tragedy like this from happening with a simple and clean fix. I am asking the Senate to join 26 of their colleagues and pass my bill Sarah’s Law.,2020-08-06 15:14:23,Twitter Web App,1,7
Sadly what happened to Sarah is not an isolated incident. We have seen this story play out time and time again in the more than four years since Sarah’s killing. Innocent lives taken by criminals that entered the U.S. illegally through a porous border—but nothing ever changes.,2020-08-06 15:13:47,Twitter Web App,0,5
Mejia posted bond was released and disappeared. Still more than 4 years later he remains a fugitive – denying Sarah’s loved ones any sense of justice or closure. As a mother I cannot fathom the grief that her family and friends continue to feel after such a devastating loss.,2020-08-06 15:12:50,Twitter Web App,0,8
Despite repeated requests by local law enforcement Immigration and Customs Enforcement failed to detain Mejia because of a nonsensical policy that allows ICE to use discretion when determining whether to detain a criminal alien charged with a violent offense.,2020-08-06 15:12:19,Twitter Web App,1,6
In Iowa we’ve learned this in a very tragic way.   On January 31st 2016 – the same day as her college graduation – Sarah Root was killed by an illegal immigrant named Edwin Mejia. He was drag racing with a blood alcohol level more than three times the legal limit.,2020-08-06 15:11:54,Twitter Web App,2,5

Whether at a VA facility in Iowa or anywhere across the country our vets should be receiving the best care possible. I’m thrilled to see my bipartisan bill advance in the Senate which would ensure those treating our nation’s vets are thoroughly vetted. https://t.co/XWLB8b3Vzm,2020-01-30 17:30:19,Twitter for iPhone,14,52
This is disheartening. Having worked on this issue for a long time it’s important we get answers &amp; clarity. I‘ll continue to work with DoD to address this because the brave young men and women who choose to serve and protect our country deserve better. https://t.co/4QicEqFOE0,2020-01-30 16:22:04,Twitter for iPhone,39,156
Deepening the stretch of the Mississippi River where over half of all US corn &amp; soybean exports are shipped thru will lead to better prices for Iowa farmers &amp; make our ag products more competitive. In my mtg w/Asst. Sec James I urged the Corps to prioritize this project in 2020. https://t.co/bGsslOIhOZ,2020-01-30 15:32:28,Twitter for iPhone,26,101
The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling confirms what we’ve been saying all along that @EPA hasn’t been upholding the law when it comes to the #RFS.

Given that not a single one of the candidates running for president this year has even asked for these funds and no candidate that has taken the money has won in 16 years I say we eliminate it.,2020-01-29 20:41:07,Twitter Web App,9,54
What’s the Presidential Election Campaign Fund you ask? Put simply it’s a federal program that’s used to fund presidential campaigns.,2020-01-29 20:41:07,Twitter Web App,8,42

Did you know? More than $350 million of your hard-earned tax dollars are currently sitting in a fund that’s sole purpose is to finance presidential campaigns—and candidates aren’t even using it.
