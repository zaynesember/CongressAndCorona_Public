Senate Democrats just introduced legislation to follow California’s lead and ban gas powered cars in the next 15 years. This would devastate Iowa’s biofuels industry and ag economy.

Extreme liberal groups that want to restrict our 2nd Amdt and allow late-term abortion are pouring millions in to back their handpicked candidate @GreenfieldIowa.

Iowa does more trade with Mexico and Canada than with the next 27 countries combined. #USMCA is a big win for Iowa. https://t.co/VKlj6Niq6T,2020-01-30 16:01:12,TweetDeck,29,133
Tomorrow’s rally will provide a clear contrast of our choice this year. We can continue the economic success we’ve had under @realDonaldTrump and a Republican Senate or we can undo this progress with higher taxes and more government control over our lives. I know which I prefer.,2020-01-29 23:35:59,TweetDeck,68,336
The forces of the radical socialist left are on the march across our state. We know there is a better way. But there’s more work to be done to push back on the coastal liberal insanity; to stand up for Iowans our farms and our very way of life in Iowa. https://t.co/QqGNmBkM5o,2020-01-29 16:42:00,TweetDeck,82,316
.@EPAAWheeler needs to honor the administration’s promises on ethanol period.  If he fails to honor the renewable fuel standard and President Trump’s promises to farmers and ethanol producers he should be replaced.   https://t.co/H4vxoeWJuW,2020-01-29 01:19:07,TweetDeck,20,81

Obama’s WOTUS rule let the federal government regulate 97% of the land in Iowa. If that isn’t government overreach I don’t know what is.   Scrapping this law is another big win for Iowa. https://t.co/T9uulEvbtN,2020-01-28 21:04:41,TweetDeck,42,127
.@JoeBiden thinks my comments prove his point about @realDonaldTrump. Wrong. Yesterday the president’s counsel showcased that the Bidens were knee deep in corruption. Corruption isn’t good politics nor is it good for the American people.,2020-01-28 16:22:27,TweetDeck,358,1361
This Impeachment mess is only serving to further divide our country. Folks in Iowa want to see us getting work done. This is not helpful to that. We need to get back to the people’s business.,2020-01-27 23:21:05,TweetDeck,9656,40723

In 2014 Pres. Obama refused to send Ukraine lethal aid.  Under @realDonaldTrump we provided lethal aid but some Dems voted no.  Now those same Dems are trying to mislead folks and their hypocrisy is stunning.  Dems only care about Ukraine if it helps them impeach the president.,2020-01-24 17:56:11,TweetDeck,129,359

What we’ve seen so far in this impeachment process is a highly partisan approach from Democrats who have been after @realDonaldTrump from day 1.   I’m committed to holding a fair trial and that’s what we’re going to do. Not the partisan mess we saw in the House.,2020-01-22 15:31:38,TweetDeck,397,1891

In 1 year we could celebrate the start of @realDonaldTrump’s 2nd term with a conservative Senate majority.  Or we could see a socialist Democrat take office with House and Senate majorities.
