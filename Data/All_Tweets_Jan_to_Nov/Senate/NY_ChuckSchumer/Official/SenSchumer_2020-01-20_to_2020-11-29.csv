The fight to #CancelStudentDebt is critically important to communities of color.  They have been hit hardest by consequences of COVID.  And they disproportionately bear the burden of student debt.

President Trump always likes diversions.  He’s miserably failing at testing.  He’s miserably failing at contact tracing.  He’s miserably failing at getting the economy going.

To @VP Pence:  The Trump admin must immediately address:  1—Availability of tests 2—Lack of clarity on how testing and care is covered for those who need it 3—Junk insurance and whether patients will face unexpected cost-sharing when being tested 4—Paid sick days for millions https://t.co/o6jMKyNlfo,2020-03-10 21:51:18,Twitter Web App,891,2190

He even said it was “actually the easiest of all things.” https://t.co/uE6FcSbUpz,2020-01-23 17:15:21,Twitter Media Studio,6093,11174
I’m heartbroken by the loss of these Americans fighting the fires in Australia.  We are forever in their debt for going to Australia to fight to protect lives animals and the environment.  https://t.co/cRV6JplIAb,2020-01-23 17:00:10,Twitter Web App,348,1390
Our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico continue to ache as they uncover more damage from this swarm of earthquakes.  President Trump: Approve the additional FEMA IA funds that Governor @WandaVazquezG's requested for recovery. ASAP.  https://t.co/fVC9EuaBiZ,2020-01-23 16:46:55,Twitter Web App,268,688
President Trump promised that unlike other Republicans—he wouldn’t touch Social Security and Medicare.  He’s already broken that promise and gone after Medicare.  And now he’s casually talking about cutting Americans’ Social Security while at a Swiss ski resort!? https://t.co/V3HVjknMbn,2020-01-23 16:34:44,Twitter Media Studio,3588,6056
The Senate Republicans saying they learned nothing new yesterday are the same Senate Republicans who voted over and over and over again on Tuesday to not bring in new important witnesses and documents.  https://t.co/Ym61MtVgjv,2020-01-23 14:05:41,Twitter for iPhone,4076,11704
The American people deserve a fair trial.  But President Trump and Senator McConnell don’t even want to consider witnesses and documents.  Why are Senate Republicans enabling a cover-up? https://t.co/zyWflKKdSt,2020-01-23 04:29:01,Twitter Media Studio,1909,6152
This is first time many of the Republican Senators have heard all these facts put together in a very cogent way with powerful speeches from Adam Schiff and the House Impeachment Managers.  I don’t see how they can listen to this and not demand witnesses and documents. https://t.co/qnHrJUsCbM,2020-01-23 03:46:44,Twitter Media Studio,5230,20851
I don't see how any Senator—Democrat or Republican—could sit on the floor hear Adam Schiff and the House Impeachment Managers and not demand witnesses and documents. #TrumpImpeachmentTrial https://t.co/pN1Dyx7K7z,2020-01-22 23:38:00,Twitter Media Studio,5902,24143
The bottom line is this:  The very first thing the American people saw when they tuned in to the impeachment trial of President Trump was Republican Senators voting against having a fair trial with relevant witnesses and documents. https://t.co/uXY8hLN41Q,2020-01-22 17:51:06,Twitter Media Studio,2873,8679
The PJM is right.  FERC needs to reverse course on this terrible rule that will exacerbate climate change and discourage clean energy.  FERC should stop bowing to the demands of special interests and act like the independent agency it’s supposed to be. https://t.co/KWWoiqpCAO,2020-01-22 17:21:32,Twitter Web App,124,351
Today marks 47 years since the Supreme Court decided Roe v. Wade.  But the Trump administration and Republicans are actively taking away a woman’s constitutional right to make her own reproductive healthcare decisions.  We must keep up the fight to protect Roe and access to care.,2020-01-22 15:36:31,Twitter for iPhone,1721,6714
I stand with the New Yorkers marching to keep the Community Reinvestment Act strong and keep banks committed to investing responsibly and equitably in their local communities.

Americans deserve a fair trial  But @SenateGOP blocked reasonable amendments that subpoena 1—WH Docs 2—State Dept Docs 3—OMB Docs 4—Mulvaney 5—DOD Docs 6⁠—Blair/Duffey 7—Relevant Docs 8—Bolton and that make (9 10 11) commonsense rules changes  Why are they enabling a cover-up?,2020-01-22 06:52:17,Twitter Web App,19850,60919
I just demanded a vote on calling as a witness Mick Mulvaney President Trump’s Acting White House Chief of Staff  Will Senate Republicans vote with us for a fair trial?  Or will they keep enabling a cover-up like they’ve done all day by voting against our requests for documents?,2020-01-22 01:11:10,Twitter Web App,8131,36246
I just took the floor to demand a vote to subpoena the witnesses and documents needed for a fair trial.  Will Senate Republicans vote for a fair trial?  Or will they enable a cover-up?,2020-01-21 20:00:02,Twitter Web App,7106,36255
Republican Senators will face a choice about getting the facts or joining Senator McConnell and President Trump in trying to cover them up.  This is a historic moment.  The eyes of America are watching. https://t.co/Jie7RfpXY9,2020-01-21 17:25:47,Twitter Media Studio,2184,6258
The Supreme Court just announced that it would delay ruling on the Administration’s lawsuit against our healthcare law.  It’s a sharp reminder to the American people that President Trump and Republicans are trying to take away Americans’ health care. https://t.co/pKng4RPoSC,2020-01-21 17:19:30,Twitter Media Studio,2303,5296
FEMA's releasing more than $39M in federal funding for rebuilding the hospital on the Puerto Rican island of Vieques after it was destroyed by Hurricanes Maria &amp; Irma.  I'm proud I've pushed for FEMA funding like this. It shouldn't take this long to help our fellow Americans.,2020-01-21 17:07:33,Twitter Web App,387,1803
10 years ago the #CitizensUnited decision opened the floodgates to dark money in our elections.  Senate Democrats are fighting to put power back in the hands of the American people.  Senator McConnell: It’s long past time for the Senate to vote on #HR1 the For The People Act.,2020-01-21 16:57:05,Twitter Web App,906,2889
Today with New Yorkers I had the honor of celebrating the legacy of Dr. King—who accomplished nothing less than the elevation of the human race  Yet we can't help but pause to consider how much of his dream still remains unrealized—how much injustice we still must fight  #MLKDay https://t.co/sZghZ4wzPf,2020-01-21 04:00:35,Twitter Web App,158,802
As soon as Senator McConnell offers this resolution I will be offering amendments to address the many flaws in this deeply unfair proposal and to subpoena the witnesses and documents we have requested. https://t.co/g25Xl8RTmU,2020-01-21 01:16:01,Twitter Media Studio,3251,10725
Under this resolution Senator McConnell is saying he doesn’t want to hear any of the existing evidence and he doesn’t want to hear any new evidence.  A trial with no evidence—no existing record no witnesses no documents—isn’t a trial at all.  It’s a cover up. https://t.co/NTvChfcnrJ,2020-01-21 00:20:02,Twitter Media Studio,12427,32007
After reading his resolution it’s clear Sen. McConnell is hell-bent on making it much more difficult to get witnesses &amp; documents and intent on rushing the trial through  On something as important as impeachment—Sen. McConnell’s resolution is nothing short of a national disgrace https://t.co/hyDVTYqdC5,2020-01-20 23:35:43,Twitter Web App,3414,8398
Congratulations to my friend and role model Johnny Ray Youngblood on his consecration as a Bishop.  He’s a beacon of strength to me and thousands of his followers who benefit from his advocacy and spiritual guidance. https://t.co/AGxQFq2Reg,2020-01-20 22:59:55,Twitter for iPhone,45,283
Senator McConnell is trying to stop witnesses and documents from coming to light.  Democrats will force a vote on witnesses and documents.  All America needs are four Senate Republicans for a fair trial.,2020-01-20 19:00:23,Twitter Web App,10491,39312
Dr. King reminded us that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.  As we continue to fight injustice let us hope and pray and work for Dr. King’s dream with the “fierce urgency of now.”  Today I’m proud to celebrate his life and dream with New Yorkers. #MLKDay https://t.co/10bdvWUCjR,2020-01-20 18:37:27,Twitter Web App,213,831
President Trump:  You keep saying you did nothing wrong.  If you really believe that: Let your men testify. Release the emails. Let the truth come out! https://t.co/4gNgHgQEwu,2020-01-20 17:50:27,Twitter Web App,8305,32087
To @SecAzar:  We need a coordinated mental health campaign in Puerto Rico NOW.  With the unprecedented devastation from the earthquakes it’s past time to act and help our fellow Americans access the care they need.  https://t.co/9M2ugj2FOx,2020-01-20 15:23:03,Twitter for iPhone,753,2609
Today I read the House managers’ brief—Smart sharp laid out a compelling case reflecting the seriousness of the charges  Then I read Pres. Trump’s counsel’s response to the summons—More like a transcript of his rallies or 6 pages of @realDonaldTrump tweets than a legal defense,2020-01-20 02:58:16,Twitter for iPhone,6992,26822
Democrats will force votes on witnesses and documents.  Trials have witnesses and documents.  Cover-ups don’t.,2020-01-20 02:27:33,Twitter for iPhone,9696,44977
