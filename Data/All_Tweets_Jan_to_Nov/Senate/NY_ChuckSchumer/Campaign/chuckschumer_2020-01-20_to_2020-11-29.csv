Joe Biden is showing courage strength and foresight in putting forward his far-reaching proposal and including Clean Cars for America in this bold plan.  Taking necessary action to confront the climate crisis is a top priority for Democrats in Congress.  https://t.co/WROSpKKoUI,2020-07-14 22:58:23,Twitter Web App,24,86
My Clean Cars for America initiative would accelerate America’s transition to all-electric vehicles on the road by 2040 and create good-paying jobs.  And it's supported by a diverse coalition of environmental labor and auto leaders.  https://t.co/WROSpKKoUI,2020-07-14 20:38:28,Twitter Web App,1,11
Vice President Biden’s bold clean energy and infrastructure plan is a breath of fresh air for America’s future.

What happened in Georgia yesterday is unacceptable. This is a democracy!  We need to fight voter suppression and we need to fight it now to make sure this doesn't happen again in November. https://t.co/aGdlvDx1Pl,2020-06-10 12:12:05,Twitter Web App,19,49
President Trump should watch @JoeBiden’s speech to the nation. That’s what real leadership looks like. https://t.co/jJdxDh98ME,2020-06-02 15:12:53,Twitter Web App,1003,3715
This statement is pathetic. President Trump quoted a racist police chief and then tries to blame everyone else for it. https://t.co/ce1OO9SkhL,2020-05-29 21:05:46,Twitter Web App,22,42

I’m so proud of history-maker Assemblywoman Rodneyse Bichotte @AMBichotte for becoming chair of the Brooklyn Democratic Party. I look forward to continuing to work with her to fight for Brooklyn and for a more just America.,2020-01-20 16:39:48,Twitter for iPhone,18,71
