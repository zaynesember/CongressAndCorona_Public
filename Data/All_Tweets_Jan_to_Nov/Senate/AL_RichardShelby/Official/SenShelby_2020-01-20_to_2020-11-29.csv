Proud we're finally closer to addressing this urgent matter. The #CARESAct contains $340B in emergency supplemental funding for those suffering due to this crisis. More than 80% of total funds in the #appropriations division will go directly to state &amp; local govts &amp; communities.,2020-03-25 17:15:47,Twitter Web App,10,25
The American people need our help in the midst of this emergency.

Instead we are allowing the Treasury Secretary to make or guarantee collateralized loans to industries whose operations the Coronavirus outbreak has jeopardized. In my judgment this approach strikes an appropriate balance between providing assistance and protecting taxpayers.,2020-03-19 22:34:33,Twitter Web App,3,16
American businesses didn’t cause this crisis &amp; aggressive action is warranted to ensure they have the liquidity necessary to weather its direct impacts.
