The Az National Guard is stockpiling medical supplies for the field hospitals we will need soon bc our hospitals are overflowing.

I cannot understand the misplaced priorities of state leaders. Our kids need school.,2020-07-07 20:19:31,Twitter for iPhone,8,89
If anyone thinks our schools are opening Aug 17th given our current trajectory think again.  @dougducey has been behind the 8 ball from the start of this pandemic and the too-little-too-late half-efforts now will not lead us to safely open schools anytime soon.

Our economy can’t recover during a rising health crisis. The virus will shut things down when left to its own devices. It is our job to reduce the virus via testing infection tracking &amp; social distancing/masks.   You can’t cheat on this or the virus will always win. /end,2020-06-30 02:20:07,Twitter for iPhone,103,647
Our first job as stewards of the state is to protect the safety of our constituents. That went by the wayside for so many weeks.

Today @dougducey said he would “err on the side of caution.” But that ship sailed a long time ago when he opened up too early opened up too much didn’t take mask wearing seriously and banned localities from taking action to protect their citizens. /4,2020-06-30 02:20:06,Twitter for iPhone,59,350
Back in April/May I expressed concern that we would would find ourselves in an endless cycle of open/shut/open/shut if the state moved to open too soon without testing tracing and isolating cases effectively and w/o citizens wearing masks and social distancing. /3,2020-06-30 02:20:05,Twitter for iPhone,38,268
Today’s executive order will help - I hope.  But a very serious question remains will it be enough? We are still operating like a Phase 2 or 3 state even though our infection numbers are the worst in the country. /2,2020-06-30 02:20:04,Twitter for iPhone,42,271
@dougducey was one of the last to enact stay-at-home &amp; one of the first to lift stay-at-home despite the fact that Az hadn’t met the CDC guidelines for Phase 1 reopening. Today Az doesn’t meet a single indicator of Phase 1.  /1,2020-06-30 02:20:01,Twitter for iPhone,280,1052
Statewide orders to #slowthespread are good though they have continually come (too) late since March.  Prohibiting local leaders from taking action to protect their constituents in the absence of state leadership is disastrous. It has exacerbated the spread of the virus.

Hoping @dougducey takes action today. It is woefully overdue.

Well it turns out we aren’t on a 14-day downward trend yet.   The CDC guidelines require a state to show 14 days of downward movement of infection/mortality rates before moving to Phase 1 of reopening. Opening too quickly will result in faster spread of coronavirus. https://t.co/Q77NwjwoBY,2020-05-05 17:28:33,Twitter for iPhone,488,1507
