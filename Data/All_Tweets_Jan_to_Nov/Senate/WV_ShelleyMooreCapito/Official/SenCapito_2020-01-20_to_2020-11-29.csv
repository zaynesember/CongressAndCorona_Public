The Navigable Waters Protection Rule is emblematic of @POTUS' insistence on commonsense regs that do not inhibit economic growth &amp; is predicated on a clear reading of Clean Water Act that protects the environment &amp; preserves the role of states in protecting their water resources.,2020-01-23 17:59:09,Twitter Web App,10,33
The previous #WOTUS rule promulgated by the Obama Admin. would have made it difficult for most Americans to determine if a federally protected body of water is located on their property &amp; severely harmed the coal natural gas construction and ag industries in West Virginia. https://t.co/tWqNBsLFEG,2020-01-23 17:59:09,Twitter Web App,64,138

Consistent with the precedent established by the Senate during the Clinton impeachment trial I believe that Senators should hear the arguments from both sides and have the opportunity to ask questions before determining whether additional evidence is needed.,2020-01-22 14:12:08,Twitter Web App,5,52
The Senate will then debate and vote on whether to subpoena additional witnesses or documents.  I voted against the amendments offered by Minority Leader Schumer that sought to subpoena documents and lock in witness testimony in advance.,2020-01-22 14:12:08,Twitter Web App,2,33
