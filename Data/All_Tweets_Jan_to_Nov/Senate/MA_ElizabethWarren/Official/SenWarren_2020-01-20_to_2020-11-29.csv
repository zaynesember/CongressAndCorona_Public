Huge numbers of Americans agree: instead of forcing student borrowers to keep signing over their paychecks the federal govt we should #CancelStudentDebt and boost our economy by putting those monthly payments back into communities and small businesses. https://t.co/MEeC6pBvIc,2020-10-09 18:49:07,Twitter Web App,823,3727
The federal govt shares responsibility for our student debt crisis. Anyone whose family couldn’t write a check for college got loaded up with debt AND charged high interest.

Too many Americans are struggling to find jobs and keep a roof over their heads during this pandemic.

I don’t have a problem with our tax-dodging President getting great medical care. I do have a problem with him trying to ram through a Supreme Court nominee who will overturn the ACA during the COVID crisis so struggling Americans can’t get health care too. https://t.co/Bi3PdpJ8IO,2020-10-08 17:32:45,Twitter Media Studio,1178,5330

People are struggling with addiction and opioid overdoses have increased during COVID-19.

Trump McConnell and Supreme Court Justices have access to some of the best medical care in the world. Many Americans don’t – and people will die if they repeal the ACA. It is reckless and wrong to ram through a nominee hand-picked to rip away health care during a pandemic.,2020-10-06 14:10:23,Twitter Web App,656,3129
Cancer survivors high-risk seniors and mamas of babies with complex medical needs are all holding their breath during this pandemic praying they won’t get sick.

Repealing the ACA would harm Americans’ health while simultaneously making it harder to contain this pandemic.

COVID-19 has also triggered depression anxiety and substance use disorders for many people across the country.

Trump has accused FDA officials of being “deep state” operatives and tied vaccine development to his reelection campaign.

Louis DeJoy has millions of dollars worth of @USPS financial conflicts. His actions are placing mail-in ballots at risk &amp; delaying delivery of millions of prescriptions.

USPS delays have also caused a big jump in prescription reshipments &amp; higher costs to send with @USPS competitors.

More Americans are getting medications filled by mail during COVID-19. But our report found that @USPS delays slowed delivery times by a lot.

My anti-corruption bill would close the ridiculous loophole that allows part-time officials to keep their financial disclosures secret.

The @USPS Board's “full support” of Louis DeJoy’s efforts to delay and degrade mail service raises serious questions about its members' motivations.

My staff requested the @USPS Board of Governors' financial disclosure reports to look for conflicts of interest but they're “not releasable” since they work less than 130 days/year.

Renters don't need empty words about protection from eviction &amp; rental assistance – they need guarantees.

The unemployment rate for white Americans is 9.2%. The rate for Black Americans is 14.6%. That racial gap isn’t a bug – it’s a part of the long-term systemic racism in our economy.

We wouldn’t have a strong @CFPB today without President @BarackObama &amp; Vice President @JoeBiden. They believed in my idea for the agency fought to keep it in the bill and helped to get it across the finish line. I’m eternally grateful their leadership.,2020-07-21 15:47:22,Twitter Web App,76,458
Here’s the way I see it: before the ink from President @BarackObama's pens were dry Wall Street’s army of lawyers &amp; lobbyists were already out to kill the agency. Trump’s team has spent 3+ years trying their hardest to break it. But the @CFPB is still here &amp; here to stay.,2020-07-21 15:47:22,Twitter Web App,64,452
Things aren't easy at the @CFPB right now. @MickMulvaneyOMB &amp; @CFPBDirector Kraninger gutted the office that fights lending discrimination &amp; have given the green light for payday lenders to trap consumers in cycles of debt.,2020-07-21 15:47:22,Twitter Web App,67,377
I talk &amp; tweet about the @CFPB every chance I get because I'm proud of that new agency.

So @RepRichmond @SenatorDurbin @maziehirono &amp; I have a bill to strengthen these investigations. https://t.co/YYfOqxvPfG,2020-07-06 23:17:52,Twitter Web App,425,1756
The @NYTimes shouldn’t have to sue the @CDCgov for access to COVID-19 racial disparities data that confirm Black &amp; Brown families are bearing the brunt of this virus.

My friend &amp; former @USDOL Secretary @RBReich is right: @OSHA_DOL abandoned workers by refusing to issue an Emergency Temporary Standard for COVID-19.

Most people assume retirement advisers must do what’s best for their customers but conflicts cost families $17B/year. @USDOL needs to scrap its proposal &amp; work on a strong conflict of interest rule that protects Americans’ retirement savings &amp; complies with Congress's intent.,2020-07-03 14:47:10,Twitter Web App,165,811
In December I warned @USDOL not to propose a conflict of interest standard that mirrored the SEC's deeply flawed new rule for broker-dealers. It waters down the fiduciary standard that has governed advisers for decades. But that's what DOL did. https://t.co/xPcx5u19QN,2020-07-03 14:47:09,Twitter Web App,138,651
For years I’ve fought the fancy trips cars &amp; kickbacks retirement advisers can receive for selling lousy products to clients.

In 2016 @BarackObama's @USDOL wrote a strong conflict of interest rule so retirement advisers would have to put their clients' interests first. But in 2018 Eugene Scalia sued to overturn it.

Public health officials &amp; assisted living residents &amp; their families need to know about COVID-19 cases &amp; fatalities. @RepMaloney @SenMarkey &amp; I have a new bill to enact strict data collection and reporting requirements for assisted living centers. https://t.co/pVWDj2xbHm,2020-07-02 16:56:01,Twitter Web App,201,529
My report with @RepMaloney &amp; @SenMarkey found: ❌ 24% of assisted living facilities had at least 1 COVID-19 case. 8% had 10+ cases ❌ 43% of infected residents were hospitalized. 31% died.  That means about 7000+ assisted living residents may have died from COVID-19 as of 5/31.,2020-07-02 16:56:01,Twitter Web App,388,730
Assisted living centers have similar COVID-19 risks as nursing homes but not the same regulations &amp; reporting requirements.

There is no easy fix for the systemic racism in our policing and justice systems. But if the Trump administration won’t do everything in its power to hold police departments accountable when officers use excessive force and kill Black Americans then Congress should make them.,2020-06-04 22:27:54,Twitter Web App,671,4112

The federal government has the power to investigate police departments with a history of discriminatory policing. But racist former AG Jeff Sessions took away @TheJusticeDept’s tools to force those police departments to reform. We can change that.,2020-06-04 22:27:53,Twitter Web App,3331,12597
There is no justice in @TheJusticeDept when the Attorney General of the United States uses an unidentifiable and unaccountable police force to respond to peaceful protests for Black lives. @CongressmanRaja @RepJeffries @SenBooker and I are demanding answers from AG Barr. https://t.co/Jwh2zrk1pF,2020-06-04 20:24:22,Twitter Web App,2476,8037

Step 7: Hold bailout recipients accountable. Create extreme transparency around how companies spend their bailout money &amp; how it helps workers. And if companies violate their bailout terms strip CEOs of their salaries &amp; allow workers to sue the company. #StopCOVIDCorruption,2020-05-12 19:07:43,Twitter Web App,153,777
Step 6: Restrict lobbying &amp; political spending. Lobbyists must disclose work related to COVID-19. No closed door meetings or calls. And any company bailed out should be banned from lobbying or political spending for at least a year after the loan is repaid. #StopCOVIDCorruption,2020-05-12 19:07:43,Twitter Web App,73,398
Step 5: Protect whistleblowers. Workers who witness COVID-19 waste fraud or abuse – or are victims of misconduct – should be protected from retaliation for reporting it. We must make it safe &amp; secure for whistleblowers to submit complaints. #StopCOVIDCorruption,2020-05-12 19:07:42,Twitter Web App,63,282
Step 4: Empower CARES Act independent watchdogs. If Treasury doesn't comply with their oversight Congress should be told &amp; Mnuchin shouldn't get paid. And if Mnuchin lies to Congress he should be liable for perjury. #StopCOVIDCorruption,2020-05-12 19:07:42,Twitter Web App,64,258
Step 3: Strengthen the Congressional Oversight Commission tasked with oversight of the CARES Act bailout.

Step 1: No more conflicts of interest in who gets relief funds &amp; who distributes them.

VA forms can be confusing &amp; veterans service orgs provide a crucial service to review vets’ claims for errors &amp; corrections before they're final so vets receive accurate benefits the first time.

For many Americans a $1200 check won’t come close to covering the bills that are piling up.

MA has the third most COVID-19 cases in the country. Our cities &amp; counties need help.

We can’t let struggling families get squeezed even further by companies out to make a quick buck. I’m introducing @RepJoeNeguse’s bill in the Senate to set tougher rules against price gouging.

Reagan was wrong: "I’m from the government &amp; I’m here to help" aren't the most terrifying words in the English language. "We're in a crisis &amp; the government has no plan" are.

Sustaining our economy also means taking steps to keep workers on payroll even if they need to stay home. Congress has already provided payroll support grants to the airlines.

And funding isn’t the only problem. Everyone except Trump knows the launch of the small business program – PPP – was a fiasco. Regulations were late systems crashed and people couldn’t do loan applications. @SBAgov &amp; @USTreasury need to fix it.,2020-04-08 14:23:05,Twitter Web App,173,995
Small business owners are panicked that there isn’t enough money to go around. Raising the cap is a start – but it won’t be enough. Every small business that qualifies should get the help they need period. We should provide an absolute guarantee.,2020-04-08 14:23:04,Twitter Web App,87,563

I am glad to continue my work with @SenatorTomUdall and colleagues to ensure that tribal nations – in MA and across the United States – receive the help they need and are entitled to in addressing COVID-19. https://t.co/6VTZ9AXSSJ,2020-04-01 23:27:01,Twitter Web App,231,1042
States like Massachusetts have opened special enrollment periods for uninsured Americans to sign up for health care. It’s unacceptable that President Trump won’t do this nationally during a pandemic. He needs to stop playing politics &amp; start saving lives. https://t.co/AbxPnMVK2L,2020-04-01 23:11:00,Twitter Web App,1645,6175

I joined @SenatorHassan @SenSherrodBrown and 31 other senators in urging @USTreasury Secretary Mnuchin &amp; @SocialSecurity Commissioner Saul to reverse the IRS’s guidance and provide stimulus payments to Social Security beneficiaries even if they don’t file tax returns. https://t.co/5g0NGf6CTx,2020-04-01 18:45:13,Twitter Web App,296,947
The @SocialSecurity Admin already knows how to deliver money to 64M Americans. Requiring seniors veterans &amp; people with disabilities to file tax returns in order to receive a stimulus check is a huge &amp; unnecessary burden for people who need relief now. https://t.co/YkFhfPYJTl,2020-04-01 18:45:13,Twitter Web App,780,2302
In this public health emergency it’s more important than ever to fairly compensate delivery workers and provide them health and safety protections. I urge these delivery companies to treat their employees with the dignity and respect they deserve.,2020-04-01 14:50:05,Twitter Web App,161,986
Because delivery companies classify workers as contractors &amp; not employees they don’t have guaranteed access to standard benefits like a minimum wage health insurance paid leave unemployment &amp; OSHA protections. This misclassification is wrong &amp; it endangers everyone's health.,2020-04-01 14:50:05,Twitter Web App,183,1190
Delivery workers at @Instacart @DoorDash @Grubhub and @UberEats are risking their health to keep Americans fed – but they don’t receive basic labor protections from their employers.

During the coronavirus crisis women are working jobs that put their lives at risk – but they’re still not getting equal pay for equal work. That's especially true for women of color. This #EqualPayDay should be a wakeup call to end the wage gap once and for all. https://t.co/RUDkk6XiC9,2020-03-31 21:23:22,Twitter Web App,532,1972
I’ll be watching Secretary Mnuchin &amp; Chairman Powell carefully as they administer this $500 billion bailout for corporate America.

One more thing: we want to see where the money goes. Bailed out companies should be required to comply with all document &amp; information requests &amp; appear as witnesses before the Special Inspector General Congressional Oversight Panel &amp; Pandemic Response Accountability Committee.,2020-03-31 20:22:33,Twitter Web App,158,917
Money that goes to bail out big companies should come with serious long-term change: a $15 minimum wage at least one seat for workers on their board of directors &amp; no union-busting. And CEOs should face civil &amp; criminal penalties for violating these terms.,2020-03-31 20:22:33,Twitter Web App,88,531
Bailouts can’t be handed out with the same old corrupt rules that reward the wealthy &amp; well-connected. Mnuchin &amp; Powell must use strong conflict of interest protections clear public rules on how they choose recipients &amp; total transparency beyond the law's requirements.,2020-03-31 20:22:33,Twitter Web App,58,315
Companies that receive federal bailout money should be barred from political spending or lobbying expenditures for the duration of the assistance. Taxpayer money shouldn’t be spent to reward politicians or pad lobbyists’ pocketbooks.,2020-03-31 20:22:33,Twitter Web App,72,357
Any bailout funds should come with strict restrictions that protect workers &amp; don’t reward corporate misbehavior. Taxpayer money should be used to keep workers on the payroll – not for executive pay bonuses or stock buybacks.,2020-03-31 20:22:32,Twitter Web App,67,382
The coronavirus bill didn’t do enough to stop corporate bailouts but Treasury Sec. Mnuchin &amp; Fed Chair Powell have vast power to decide how to hand out this money. I sent a detailed list of principles that would protect workers &amp; root out corruption. https://t.co/eK8lXdx2kn,2020-03-31 20:22:32,Twitter Web App,1294,5504

Health care providers &amp; public health leaders in MA &amp; across the country are doing everything they can to fight this crisis but the Trump administration continues to fail them. I want @FEMA to explain how the federal govt will make sure states like MA receive their supplies.,2020-03-31 15:04:44,Twitter Web App,1525,6036
MA requested supplies from the Strategic National Stockpile nearly a month ago. Only a fraction ever came. Without Trump’s full &amp; consistent use of the DPA state officials are still scrambling to find essential equipment but the federal govt has created a logistical black hole.,2020-03-31 15:04:44,Twitter Web App,1680,6323
Trump told states they were on their own to purchase medical equipment so that’s what MA tried to do. But then the federal government outbid MA at least 3 times – and reports show two of our orders were seized by federal authorities. This is unacceptable. https://t.co/QlyFUpkdpf,2020-03-31 15:04:44,Twitter Web App,25800,57862
Massachusetts has some of the very best doctors in the world and I’m grateful for their lifesaving work every day.

Comprehensive demographic data on who is being tested &amp; treated for coronavirus doesn’t exist. @RepPressley &amp; I aren't going to let up until we see @HHSgov collect solid data &amp; make real progress to ensure communities of color have equal access to free testing &amp; treatment.,2020-03-30 22:54:01,Twitter Web App,219,1096
Decades of structural racism have prevented people of color from accessing quality health care affordable housing and financial security. The coronavirus outbreak is blowing these disparities wide open.,2020-03-30 22:54:01,Twitter Web App,316,1729
Coronavirus doesn’t discriminate but racial disparities in our health care system may mean Black and Brown families aren't being tested or treated equally for COVID-19. @RepPressley and I want @HHSGov to find out. https://t.co/bS5qV16n6B,2020-03-30 22:54:01,Twitter Web App,1932,7594
This isn’t just a matter of life or death – it’s an economic necessity. Helping state &amp; local govts that are facing billions of dollars in debt fighting this crisis could mean the difference between a brief recession &amp; prolonged depression. It must be Mnuchin’s top priority. https://t.co/PpRv8UCzQ0,2020-03-30 20:33:48,Twitter Web App,200,619
MA is in a race against time for medical supplies while hundreds of our hospital workers already have COVID-19. NY has put up trailers as morgues. Mnuchin has a choice: he can help save lives on the frontlines of this pandemic or he can bail out a bunch of corporate executives.,2020-03-30 20:33:47,Twitter Web App,246,1084
The law is clear: the $454B fund Congress approved last week can be used to help struggling state &amp; local governments – not just big corporations. Secretary Mnuchin should meet every one of their needs before a single unnecessary cent goes to enrich CEOs. https://t.co/whZ33uGHNQ,2020-03-30 20:33:47,Twitter Web App,1040,3800

No President Trump Massachusetts is not happy. The Commonwealth has received a fraction of its requested supplies. Your administration has outbid or seized our direct purchases. Health workers’ lives are at risk and people are dying. https://t.co/atEF0tMdL0,2020-03-30 00:10:13,Twitter Media Studio,10070,33396
Finally we can’t learn from widespread testing if we don’t track who we’ve tested and when we’ve tested them. @HHSGov must collect more data on our testing capacity and results so state and local officials know where and how to distribute resources to combat COVID-19.,2020-03-28 16:41:46,Twitter Web App,421,2196
Testing at scale will require a massive public health workforce which is why the federal government should also fund the training of more workers at all levels to set up testing sites across the country and determine how many people have or have had coronavirus.,2020-03-28 16:41:46,Twitter Web App,453,3018
The Defense Production Act can also help us boost production of the masks gowns and other protective equipment that medical workers need to conduct tests in the first place. Without gear we can’t safely test. The federal government must increase the production of PPE too.,2020-03-28 16:41:45,Twitter Web App,376,2364
We need a federally-funded surge in the production of diagnostic tests to ramp up our capacity &amp; minimize supply disruptions. The best tool we have to boost production at scale is the DPA a tool that President Trump has repeatedly waffled on. Congress must force him to.,2020-03-28 16:41:45,Twitter Web App,384,1767
Diagnostic tests personal protective equipment &amp; medical workers are intricately connected. Our comprehensive federal response must recognize how these pieces of the coronavirus puzzle fit together. I’ve outlined a series of proposals that do just that. https://t.co/ZbtQEUbeSY,2020-03-28 16:41:45,Twitter Web App,459,1849
We can’t stop coronavirus without widespread testing. But we can’t test widely without boosting the production of test materials ramping up the supply of protective gear needed to conduct tests and increasing the number of medical workers testing people in the first place.,2020-03-28 16:41:45,Twitter Web App,3987,20046
Without coronavirus tests our health care workers are fighting coronavirus blind &amp; our communities are stuck in limbo. The only way we’ll know how to control this epidemic is with rigorous testing.

If Trump won’t use the DPA Congress needs to step in &amp; force his administration to act. Congress just gave them $1 billion more to get industry up &amp; running – now it must make the President use it for more tests more PPE &amp; more supplies to protect the American people.,2020-03-27 20:18:13,Twitter Web App,520,2882
President Trump already has the full authority to require companies to produce test kits ventilators and critical medical supplies – he just refuses to use it. He can mobilize our industrial might if he wants to without a single angry tweet.,2020-03-27 20:18:13,Twitter Web App,901,4596

Congress should require @HHSgov to report demographic info for people tested to make sure tests are being distributed equally.

Congress can also boost funding for the Public Health Service Commissioned Corps to hire and train temporary workers to administer tests. There are tasks that don’t require medical degrees &amp; plenty of people temporarily out of work who can receive on-the-job training.,2020-03-26 13:28:02,Twitter Web App,1426,8736
Next Congress can also help end the testing logjam by creating a dedicated test fund to issue guaranteed contracts with public &amp; private manufacturers. And it should provide grants for cash-strapped public health labs &amp; doctors’ offices to purchase test equipment.,2020-03-26 13:28:01,Twitter Web App,1414,9066
Congress can put its foot down &amp; force President Trump to use the Defense Production Act to develop tests the raw materials needed for those tests and the protective equipment necessary for health care professionals to administer them. @SenatorBaldwin’s bill would do just that.,2020-03-26 13:28:01,Twitter Web App,2435,12070

It even sounds like Trump hotel properties like Mar-a-Largo could receive huge bags of cash – and then fire their workers – if Steve Mnuchin decides to do a solid for his boss with taxpayer dollars.,2020-03-22 16:35:24,Twitter Web App,4087,14096
I’m hearing that this so-called “deal” will include $450B for Trump to dole out to companies with: -No meaningful requirement that companies maintain payroll or benefits -No serious restrictions on stock buybacks -No requirements to reduce executive pay -No ongoing oversight,2020-03-22 16:35:24,Twitter Web App,4210,14679
Millions may now lose their jobs. And Trump wants our response to be a half-trillion dollar slush fund to boost favored companies and corporate executives – while they continue to pull down huge paychecks and fire their workers. Here’s what I know and how we stop it:,2020-03-22 16:35:24,Twitter Web App,25187,87178
We’re weeks past the point that President Trump should be using the Defense Production Act as “leverage” with big companies. Hospitals need ventilators masks &amp; other equipment NOW. Stop asking for volunteers &amp; start ordering America’s manufacturing industry to get to work. https://t.co/eHqF0RCokY,2020-03-22 15:30:29,Twitter Web App,6331,20337
More than 100 House members have already called for similar conditions that major corporations should meet to help workers &amp; taxpayers if they want federal money. Let’s get this done &amp; not make the same mistakes of 2008 in the next stimulus package. https://t.co/0w3cb8oDt3,2020-03-22 14:33:55,Twitter Web App,194,841
Earlier this week I announced 8 requirements that we believe companies should meet if they want a bailout. Yesterday I wrote the legislative text. Stimulus negotiators just need to drop it in the next package. https://t.co/AKdWfsQCm2,2020-03-22 14:33:55,Twitter Web App,425,1641
Taxpayer money that goes to bail out big companies must go to workers – not CEOs &amp; shareholders. @RepMarkPocan @RepJayapal @RepLloydDoggett &amp; I want strings attached to any corporate bailout money in the next stimulus package to put #WorkersFirst. https://t.co/9nFwd4PztO,2020-03-22 14:33:55,Twitter Web App,1189,4184
13 senators joined @SenSherrodBrown @SenatorDurbin &amp; me in urging @SenateMajLdr McConnell to #cancelstudentdebt in the next stimulus package.

As some of the country's largest employers @Amazon @Walmart &amp; @McDonalds have a duty to protect their workers &amp; ensure they’re not making this pandemic worse. They should adopt @PattyMurray &amp; @GillibrandNY’s policy to provide all employees with 14 days emergency paid leave.,2020-03-21 22:01:38,Twitter Web App,168,949
Coronavirus doesn’t care if someone is a full-time or part-time worker – or franchisee or contractor. It doesn’t care if someone has accrued enough sick time. Paid leave policies that exclude certain workers leave them with no good options &amp; put everyone at risk.,2020-03-21 22:01:38,Twitter Web App,267,1702
I appreciate that @Amazon @Walmart &amp; @McDonalds have kept their doors open so people have access to food. But they also need to protect the health of workers &amp; the American people. I’m urging them to do the right thing &amp; give all workers paid sick leave. https://t.co/kutTFsbi42,2020-03-21 22:01:38,Twitter Web App,1246,6808
Airport workers &amp; contractors put themselves at risk by going to work during this crisis &amp; many don’t receive insurance or sick leave from greedy airline employers.

.@SenatorTomUdall is absolutely right: tribal nations Native communities &amp; @IHSgov need help NOW. Congress must guarantee their access to the Strategic National Stockpile of drugs &amp; medical supplies &amp; empower Indian Country to fight the crisis. We have a bill to do exactly that. https://t.co/fItF9MkvxW,2020-03-20 19:05:49,Twitter Web App,396,1432
This still isn't good enough. We need to #cancelstudentdebt payments during this emergency not pause them. And the federal government should cancel at least $10000 for all student borrowers to help families &amp; our economy. https://t.co/druvoPv96n,2020-03-20 16:56:46,Twitter Web App,1124,4679

Now's a good time to remind everyone that members of Congress should not be able to own or trade individual stocks while in office.

@BetsyDeVosED refused to follow the Obama-era rules requiring @usedgov to cancel the loans of students cheated by for-profit colleges – then wrote her own rules with for-profits to block relief for students.

Remember Leonard Chanin the guy who failed to regulate subprime mortgages &amp; crashed our economy?

That’s what my Ending Too Big to Jail Act is all about. https://t.co/jIETdssGrs,2020-02-21 00:14:00,Twitter Media Studio,847,4186
2/3 of part-time retail workers want full-time work but corporations keep them part-time to skimp on wages &amp; benefits. My Part-Time Worker Bill of Rights would make big companies offer available hrs to their part-time workers before hiring new employees. https://t.co/CAzXuZMST7,2020-02-20 21:22:40,Twitter Web App,625,3242
The Trump admin is selling out our public lands &amp; coasts because they work for their former &amp; future Big Oil clients. We should protect our nation’s natural treasures invest in a clean energy future &amp; tackle the climate crisis head-on.

MA has some of the country’s strongest gun safety laws but the federal govt must step up to help keep our communities safe.

We’ve got a housing crisis in this country &amp; working families are getting crushed by skyrocketing costs. So I’ve got a bill to invest in 3.2 million new housing units reduce rents by 10% &amp; create 1.5 million jobs. We can do this. https://t.co/vHbhOrqITK,2020-02-20 00:05:03,Twitter Media Studio,739,3197
America’s workers have always had to fight for economic fairness &amp; basic human dignity on the job. A minimum wage. Workplace safety protections. A 40-hour workweek. Now it’s time to fight for #SchedulesThatWork.,2020-02-19 19:31:34,Twitter for iPhone,155,854
My #SchedulesThatWork Act would set some ground rules for retail fast food &amp; other hourly workers’ schedules: ❌ Workers should get their schedule 2 weeks in advance ❌ No retaliation for requesting schedule changes ❌ Workers have a right to rest between shifts,2020-02-19 19:31:33,Twitter for iPhone,247,1380
More than half of hourly workers get their schedules with less than a week’s notice &amp; hours can fluctuate 40-70% each month. That makes it nearly impossible to go to school get child care &amp; pay the bills. That’s why @RosaDeLauro &amp; I have the #SchedulesThatWork Act. https://t.co/cwFiWHzv8Z,2020-02-19 19:29:47,Twitter Media Studio,783,3190
I didn’t come to Washington to kiss up to giant Wall Street banks &amp; their armies of lawyers &amp; lobbyists. I’m going to keep asking the tough questions &amp; fighting for accountability to make this government work for the people.,2020-02-19 15:41:25,Twitter Web App,332,1729
I also introduced the most ambitious anti-corruption bill since Watergate to lock the revolving door between Wall St &amp; Washington. Banks shouldn't be able to pre-bribe employees to work for the govt &amp; regulators shouldn't spend their time in office auditioning for their next gig.,2020-02-19 15:41:24,Twitter Web App,280,1468
A year later I introduced the Corporate Executive Accountability Act to force CEOs of companies like Equifax and Wells Fargo to take responsibility for their actions.

We need real accountability for big Wall Street banks – and the people who run them. So on the 10th anniversary of the financial crisis I introduced the Ending Too Big to Jail Act to put big bank executives in handcuffs when their banks break the law.,2020-02-19 15:41:24,Twitter Web App,122,562

Outside of Washington my bill to #EndCorruptionNow seems like a no-brainer. Most people are probably shocked these rules aren’t already the law. But if we want to restore integrity to the Office of the President we need to fight for real change to make it happen.,2020-02-17 16:03:17,Twitter Web App,538,3027
And we shouldn’t have to beg presidential candidates to see their financial interests. That’s why my bill to #EndCorruptionNow would require the IRS to release tax returns for Presidential candidates from the previous 8 years &amp; during each year in federal office.,2020-02-17 16:03:17,Twitter Web App,626,3462
Former Presidents &amp; other Washington bigwigs shouldn’t be able to cash in on their connections with high-powered lobbying jobs.

The President also shouldn’t be able to put his or her lobbyist friends in charge of running federal agencies.

But President Trump’s new budget doesn’t cut spending everywhere. He’s called for $2 billion more in funding for the border wall – his monument to hate &amp; division. And he’s called for hundreds of millions more for agencies he’s using to lock kids in cages &amp; terrorize communities. https://t.co/yULDuHMBU2,2020-02-11 20:12:10,Twitter Web App,81,214

Senator Schumer has called for an amendment vote tonight to subpoena Mulvaney Bolton Duffy Blair &amp; White House OMB DoD and State Dept documents. These are the witnesses &amp; documents we need for this impeachment trial.,2020-02-01 00:20:21,Twitter Web App,3826,25088

Americans deserve to know that the President is using the power of his/her office to work in the nation’s interest not his own personal interest. And they deserve a Senate with the political courage to stand up to a President that has abused his power &amp; corrupted our government.,2020-01-31 15:36:15,Twitter Web App,558,3371
Faith in our American institutions is at an all-time low. The fact that GOP senators are covering up the President’s corruption with a sham impeachment trial without witnesses &amp; documents doesn’t help. History will judge us for what happens next.,2020-01-31 15:36:15,Twitter Web App,1965,10763
Giant banks received billions in taxpayer bailouts during the financial crisis. Now Trump-appointed regulators are slashing safeguards that prevent the same thing from happening all over again.

I asked @RepAdamSchiff: At time when many have lost faith in govt does the fact that the Chief Justice is presiding over an impeachment trial in which GOP senators refuse witnesses or evidence contribute to the loss of legitimacy of the Chief Justice SCOTUS &amp; Constitution? https://t.co/H4Txt68EdX,2020-01-30 23:11:52,Twitter Media Studio,7019,32586
One year ago today @RepAdamSmith &amp; I introduced our No First Use Act a bill that would commit the US to not using nuclear weapons first.

After a day of spin &amp; distractions &amp; plain old incoherence by President Trump’s lawyers I’ve got one question for this Senate impeachment trial: Where are the witnesses?,2020-01-30 04:13:44,Twitter Web App,4170,27488

“Right-to-work” laws undermine unions &amp; drive down wages for America’s workers – especially workers of color. Unions built America’s middle class &amp; unions will rebuild America’s middle class. I’m in this fight to end “right-to-work” laws &amp; empower American workers all the way.,2020-01-29 23:50:12,Twitter Web App,171,974
So called “right-to-work” laws are anti-worker laws with one goal: to keep employees from organizing for higher wages better benefits &amp; a stronger retirement. I’m glad to partner with @BradSherman on a bill to ban state “right-to-work” laws. https://t.co/G34xbQpiOM,2020-01-29 23:50:12,Twitter Web App,342,1614
The “peace plan” endorses annexation offers no chance for a viable Palestinian state &amp; didn’t involve Palestinians. It’s a distraction from Trump’s impeachment &amp; Netanyahu’s indictment.

President Trump’s lawyers can’t argue that there’s no direct evidence of his misconduct when there’s a witness waving his hand (and book) around trying to state otherwise.

If President Trump did absolutely nothing wrong he should release all of the documents &amp; stop blocking witnesses from testifying in this impeachment trial. It’s as simple as that.,2020-01-25 16:07:37,Twitter Web App,7415,41385

The fraud at @WellsFargo &amp; other giant banks won’t stop until execs like John Stumpf know they’ll be hauled out in handcuffs for cheating customers. That’s why I’ve got a bill to hold Wall St execs personally accountable when their banks break the law. https://t.co/uRlfxsoJ44,2020-01-24 20:50:17,Twitter Web App,173,682
And in August after reports that Wells Fargo charged fees on accounts customers thought were closed I wrote to @CFPB @USOCC &amp; @SEC_News asking why they permitted Wells Fargo to squeeze customers three years after the fake accounts scam. https://t.co/n7Mo9CuUZr,2020-01-24 20:50:16,Twitter Web App,94,391
Six days after we called on the @USOCC &amp; @CFPB to fire Tim Sloan he stepped down as @WellsFargo’s CEO. I told Comptroller Otting to use his agency’s regulatory power to review Sloan’s successor &amp; he agreed. https://t.co/sgwC6ien9C,2020-01-24 20:50:16,Twitter Web App,26,114
Tim Sloan said the bank changed but we weren’t fooled. @WellsFargo kept right on scamming its customers on mortgages car loans money laundering – the list goes on &amp; on. So @SenSherrodBrown &amp; I told the @CFPB &amp; @USOCC to use their power to fire him. https://t.co/rLmhICfWLy,2020-01-24 20:50:16,Twitter Web App,27,106
Then I urged the new Fed Chair Jerome Powell to hold a public vote of the Federal Reserve Board before lifting @WellsFargo’s growth cap &amp; he agreed. https://t.co/JeetsvMWtX,2020-01-24 20:50:15,Twitter Web App,26,100
I also urged Janet Yellen to use her powers as Fed Chair to hold @WellsFargo accountable. In her final act as Fed Chair she froze Wells Fargo’s growth until it cleaned up its act &amp; pushed out 4 board members. https://t.co/hEhPVy6GoG,2020-01-24 20:50:15,Twitter Web App,25,110

I’ve done everything in my power as a US Senator to hold @WellsFargo’s executives accountable for opening millions of fake accounts in their customers’ names. In 2016 I told CEO John Stumpf that he should resign. (He did.) https://t.co/PjVLffUuwg,2020-01-24 20:50:14,Twitter Web App,34,150
During my very first banking committee hearing in 2013 I asked our bank regulators when they last took a bank to trial for breaking the law. They couldn’t answer it.

The rules that Senator McConnell &amp; the Republicans rammed through the Senate tonight are designed to protect President Trump – not guarantee a fair &amp; honest impeachment trial. The rules are rigged.,2020-01-22 06:52:59,Twitter Web App,4149,21193
Sen. Schumer’s 11th amendment allows Chief Justice Roberts – a neutral party – to approve witnesses &amp; evidence that are relevant to the impeachment charges.,2020-01-22 06:36:44,Twitter Web App,2303,15287
Senator Schumer’s tenth amendment gives each side 24 hours to respond to written motions – not 2 hours as provided in Senator McConnell’s rules. This should be simple – people should have time to read what they're responding to.,2020-01-22 06:25:25,Twitter Web App,1044,5805
Senator Schumer’s ninth amendment eliminates an obstacle in Senator McConnell's rules and provides a vote on any motion to subpoena witnesses &amp; documents after the impeachment trial question period. No further debates needed.,2020-01-22 06:19:15,Twitter Web App,503,2867
Sen. Schumer’s eighth amendment will subpoena former National Security Advisor John Bolton who has already said that he’s willing to testify about the “many relevant meetings &amp; conversations” he knew about relating to Ukraine. McConnell should let him testify in the Senate.,2020-01-22 05:05:24,Twitter Web App,1160,6659
Sen. Schumer's seventh amendment is short but important: the President doesn't get to pick &amp; choose which evidence he provides to the Senate. If he wants docs admitted he must turn over everything asked for in the subpoena. This helps prevent selective admission of evidence.,2020-01-22 04:54:46,Twitter Web App,1833,10284
Sen. Schumer’s amendment will also subpoena Michael Duffey from OMB. 90 minutes after President Trump’s July call with Ukraine's President Duffey told the Pentagon not to release the aid to Ukraine that Congress had approved &amp; to keep quiet about it. He should also testify.,2020-01-22 03:41:02,Twitter Web App,362,2355
Sen. Schumer’s sixth amendment will subpoena Robert Blair an advisor to acting WH Chief of Staff Mulvaney who was on the line during President Trump’s July call with the Ukrainian President. He refused to testify in the House. He should testify in the Senate trial.,2020-01-22 03:41:01,Twitter Web App,809,5301

Sen. Schumer’s fifth amendment will subpoena “all documents communications and other records within the possession custody or control of the Department of Defense” related to Ukraine. We should see all evidence of the orders that the Pentagon received to freeze Ukraine's aid.,2020-01-22 02:48:47,Twitter Web App,1055,6480
Sen. Schumer’s fourth amendment will subpoena acting WH Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney.

Mulvaney should testify.,2020-01-22 01:25:16,Twitter Web App,788,4449
After 3 amendments every GOP senator has voted: ❌No on subpoenas for White House documents ❌No on subpoenas for State Dept documents ❌ No on subpoenas for OMB documents This is a sham trial.,2020-01-22 01:21:43,Twitter Web App,17688,72808
Sen. Schumer’s third amendment will subpoena “all documents communications and other records within the possession custody or control of the Office of Management and Budget” related to Ukraine. An OMB official told the Pentagon to hold Ukraine's aid – we need that evidence.,2020-01-22 00:19:57,Twitter Web App,761,4420
So here’s where we are: the Senate GOP won’t subpoena documents from the White House – and won’t subpoena documents from the State Department. If they truly believe in a fair impeachment trial why are they hiding evidence?,2020-01-21 23:37:01,Twitter Web App,8885,46366
Sen. Schumer’s second amendment will subpoena “all documents communications and other records within the possession custody or control of the Department of State” related to Ukraine.
