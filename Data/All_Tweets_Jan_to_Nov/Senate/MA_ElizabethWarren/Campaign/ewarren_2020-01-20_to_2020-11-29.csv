People all over the country are supporting local institutions on #SmallBusinessSaturday—but Washington needs to have their backs too. Small businesses need real relief so they can make it to the other side of this crisis.,2020-11-28 15:31:47,Twitter Web App,832,7905
It worked. Eventually everyone got back to eating and talking—and Aunt Max was never in charge of bringing the turkey again.  Though Thanksgiving this year isn’t going the way we’d planned we can adapt smile about Thanksgiving memories and help each other get through this.,2020-11-26 16:01:11,Twitter Web App,78,2670
An uproar followed as everyone loudly explained that “bring the turkey” meant a cooked turkey. Aunt Max considered that then laughed. She said we'd eat Thanksgiving dinner in layers—a Jell-O course a potato course a pie course—finishing with a turkey course in about 6 hours.,2020-11-26 16:01:11,Twitter Web App,47,1504
They burst through the front door and Uncle Crowbar banged the heavy roaster on the kitchen countertop as people crowded around to see the turkey. With a flourish Aunt Max lifted the lid proclaiming “Biggest Turkey Ever!”  Everyone jumped back. It was RAW.,2020-11-26 16:01:10,Twitter Web App,25,654
My mother fretted and Aunt Alice fumed. The boys buzzed around trying to get a spoonful of this or a crust of that. Aunt Bee tried to keep everything in order. Still no Aunt Max. Then one of the boys spotted her coming up the walk with Uncle Crowbar (that name is another story).,2020-11-26 16:01:10,Twitter Web App,27,615
Thanksgiving dinner was set for noon and most of the family was there by mid-morning. The table was set. The sweet potato casseroles were out of the oven. The pies were on display. The Jell-O molds were out on special plates. Food was piled everywhere. But no Aunt Max.,2020-11-26 16:01:10,Twitter Web App,23,576
Aunt Max was funny and quick-talking. She never took anything too seriously including time. And she wasn’t much of a cook so the other sisters made sure that she was up to the task—peppering her with questions making sure she'd get a big enough turkey.,2020-11-26 16:01:09,Twitter Web App,22,624
Holidays have been different this year. I’m holding onto joyful memories from years ago—like one time when my Aunt Max volunteered to handle the Thanksgiving turkey: https://t.co/hjV6d9x88Y,2020-11-26 16:01:09,Twitter Web App,322,5012
This Thanksgiving I’m thinking of everyone who’s lost loved ones and everyone who’s making sacrifices to help keep their friends families and communities safe.,2020-11-26 13:32:30,Twitter Web App,1984,27672
This isn't a game.  These reckless moves don’t just have consequences for a Biden administration—they have consequences for millions of Americans struggling to get by.  https://t.co/eRoZGxdQA1,2020-11-26 02:06:14,Twitter Web App,1767,8283
Good.   I stand with the Amazon workers demanding better pay and stronger workplace protections during this crisis and beyond—and Amazon shouldn’t undermine its workers’ legal right to organize. https://t.co/YdBWvXQxX1,2020-11-26 00:26:54,Twitter Web App,701,7187
Members of Congress are there to serve the people—not to pursue personal financial interests and pad their portfolios.   It’s past time to ban government officials from trading individual stocks.  https://t.co/f8CUceDlDQ,2020-11-25 22:37:55,Twitter Web App,1010,5514
Millions of families are struggling to put food on the table this holiday season and Mitch McConnell and Republicans in the Senate are flat-out refusing to help.  This isn’t just a leadership failure—it’s a moral failure. https://t.co/qmpRzeVKT7,2020-11-25 20:54:55,Twitter Web App,1007,4889
We’ve got a quarter of a million dead and cases surging. But instead of fighting the pandemic Donald Trump fought tooth and nail against a smooth transition during this crisis.   He's leaving just the way he came in—selfish reckless and completely incapable of leadership.,2020-11-24 23:55:25,Twitter Web App,4942,38346
Essential workers are putting their lives on the line.   My Essential Workers Bill of Rights would provide health and safety protections hazard pay paid sick leave and much more.   We need to pass it now.  https://t.co/BZvmierI0h,2020-11-24 20:52:05,Twitter Web App,785,5309
Republicans looked the other way while the Trump administration tried to silence voters spread lies and undermine the foundation of our democracy.   The transition may be finally underway but we can never forget which side they chose in this moment of crisis.,2020-11-24 17:38:55,Twitter Web App,7037,46895

Now that we’ve won (even though we have a sore loser on our hands) it’s time to deliver bold solutions to turn the page on this dark time in our democracy.  Because we can’t just walk away from Donald Trump’s corrupt swampy administration—we have to run away.,2020-11-23 20:42:17,Twitter Web App,2024,23749
Donald Trump’s anti-democratic actions are a stain on the United States—and on movements for democracy all around the world.,2020-11-23 17:14:30,Twitter Web App,2531,28511
We need to rebuild trust in government.   With a single executive order @JoeBiden can lock the revolving door between government and industry reduce lobbyist influence and end conflicts of interest for executive branch personnel.,2020-11-22 20:13:30,Twitter Web App,3694,32835
Joe and Kamala unseated an incumbent president for the first time in a generation. On January 20 it’s time to deliver real bold solutions.,2020-11-22 15:53:12,Twitter Web App,5281,77095
In addition to rejoining the Paris Climate Accord a Biden-Harris administration can declare the climate crisis a national emergency on day one in order to start marshaling resources towards tackling it head-on.,2020-11-21 22:01:00,Twitter Web App,2358,24058
Let's be clear: The Republicans who are staying silent dodging questions or releasing wishy-washy say-nothing statements as this administration refuses to concede and spreads daily disinformation are complicit in a dangerous attack on the core foundation of our democracy.,2020-11-21 18:38:30,Twitter Web App,18759,126180
The pandemic is surging—and the protections that have been keeping families afloat expire in just a few weeks.   Congress could provide immediate support to struggling families help contain this virus and revive our economy.   Instead Mitch McConnell sent Congress home.,2020-11-20 21:55:17,Twitter Web App,1322,7384
Thank you for sharing your story @rgay.   Student loan debt is an anchor on our struggling economy holding entire generations back.  Now is not the time for half-measures. Now is the time for bold investments in our future. https://t.co/GIuJZYwzeB,2020-11-20 20:08:03,Twitter Web App,452,4343
These allegations are horrific.   On their first day in office @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris can use existing executive authority to hold companies like Tyson accountable for COVID-19 workplace safety.  https://t.co/Sxu4fPgaEi,2020-11-20 18:35:50,Twitter Web App,1062,6283
Mitch McConnell pushed a Supreme Court justice through in just 30 days. But with COVID-19 surging and unemployment back on the rise he won't lift a finger for working families. https://t.co/RQcXQPHSm4,2020-11-19 20:09:03,Twitter Web App,4769,24405
It’s time to deliver big bold solutions for the American people. From canceling student debt to declaring the climate crisis a national emergency to centering racial equity in the fight against COVID-19 here’s what @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris can do on day one. https://t.co/DsNV2k3GHf,2020-11-19 19:06:33,Twitter Media Studio,867,4526
This crisis has disproportionately impacted communities of color from the start—and racial equity should be front and center in our response. On day one a Biden-Harris administration can collect and report COVID-19 racial data and review racial disparities in pandemic funding.,2020-11-19 15:48:41,Twitter Web App,549,5091
A Biden-Harris administration can make bold changes on day one to save lives—like lowering the price of drugs like insulin and EpiPens for millions by producing them at low costs using existing authority that lets the government bypass patents for pressing public health needs.,2020-11-19 02:23:01,Twitter Web App,1669,16886
Generations of discrimination have left communities of color with less savings and intergenerational wealth—forcing them to borrow more for the same degrees. Cancelling student loan debt will build Black and Brown wealth and help close the racial wealth gap.,2020-11-18 22:39:58,Twitter Web App,1131,8966
With a single order the Biden-Harris administration can padlock the revolving door between government and industry reduce the influence of lobbyists and eliminate conflicts of interest—setting the strongest-ever ethics and anti-corruption standards for the executive branch.,2020-11-18 20:43:00,Twitter Web App,2399,19617
There are lots of big changes that a Biden-Harris administration can achieve through executive orders and agency action on day one.   Here are some bold steps the new administration can take immediately using existing legal authority: https://t.co/LxCYjLK14E,2020-11-18 18:39:07,Twitter Media Studio,1144,5306
Right now over 44 million Americans owe over 1.6 trillion dollars in student loans. This debt is an anchor on our economy holding back entire generations from buying homes starting businesses and families and adding to the economy in ways that benefit everyone.,2020-11-18 01:21:36,Twitter Web App,4288,35461
This is unacceptable.  This pandemic is surging and soon many of the critical protections Americans have been relying on will expire—emergency unemployment assistance the eviction moratorium student loan forbearance and more.  Mitch McConnell needs to act now. https://t.co/acdWqPqxyg,2020-11-17 21:13:45,Twitter Web App,1373,7593
Wearing a mask isn’t controversial or political. It’s a simple way to protect yourself and others backed by scientists and medical professionals. And it's behavior that should be modeled by anyone in Congress who cares about the health and safety of their fellow Americans. https://t.co/5D7NgKfD3P,2020-11-17 19:14:56,Twitter Web App,883,7577
We need to deliver real bold solutions to the problems we face. Acquiescing to an unpopular and timid agenda that further entrenches the wealthy and the well-connected will just lead us to more division more anger more inequality and an even bigger hole to climb out of.,2020-11-17 01:13:32,Twitter for iPhone,1384,10883
Wear a mask. Social distance. Don’t gather in large groups.  This will be a difficult holiday season—but it will be even more difficult if we don’t get this latest surge under control.,2020-11-16 22:11:17,Twitter Web App,2298,22645
The president has the power to broadly cancel student loan debt help close the racial wealth gap and give a big boost to families and our economy—all without waiting for Congress. https://t.co/J1KLlByrbT,2020-11-16 19:55:55,Twitter Media Studio,809,4935
This is heartbreaking—and a direct result of the steady stream of lies flowing from the Trump administration to the American people from the beginning. https://t.co/xmbgy5gCYT,2020-11-16 18:38:21,Twitter Web App,3318,19258

Bold policies to improve opportunity for all are broadly popular. Now Democrats need to deliver on those policies for the American people—for those who voted for us those who did not and those who were too disenchanted or disenfranchised to vote.,2020-11-15 15:24:28,Twitter Web App,1211,11609

COVID-19 is only getting worse by the day. @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris have a plan to fight this pandemic but we can’t wait two more months to act.  We need more testing more contact tracing and more PPE—and we need it now. https://t.co/ULDagoi8Du,2020-11-13 17:03:11,Twitter Web App,1403,9975

Remember this come January: Republicans were never serious about debt. What they were serious about was giving their rich friends and donors giveaways instead of making sure we have decent schools decent transit systems and decent housing for the people who need it.,2020-11-12 01:09:59,Twitter Web App,11950,74429
And Facebook’s ill-conceived policies aren't just endangering our democracy.   Their ad ban is even currently preventing some non-profits from raising critical resources and reaching people during a pandemic and economic crisis.   Enough.,2020-11-11 22:41:54,Twitter Web App,727,6162
Facebook has repeatedly fumbled its responsibility to protect our democracy. They’ve made big proclamations about the work they’re doing to fight misinformation but what’s actually happening on their platform speaks for itself.   https://t.co/59uG9JHeRR,2020-11-11 22:41:54,Twitter Web App,1023,6575
This is a straw man.   The problem isn’t the ads. It’s Facebook’s unwillingness to regulate those ads and their inability to control organic disinformation on their platform—which they’re now letting run wild during a critical moment for our democracy. https://t.co/pr8UmeTxBe,2020-11-11 22:41:54,Twitter Web App,3797,22960

These delays are unacceptable. We're in the midst of a pandemic—and @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris will need to hit the ground running once they’re in office.

Republicans will scream about the debt.  But debt didn't matter so much to them when it came to trillions in tax cuts for their rich friends.  No more playing by two different sets of rules. No more giving in to Republican hypocrisy. We need bold investments and we need them now.,2020-11-10 00:44:23,Twitter Web App,10547,75369
The American people made their voices heard in record numbers and chose @JoeBiden as their next president.

It's not enough to just send Donald Trump packing or even just to repair the damage he’s done.

The Republican Party cheated.  They cheated because they're scared they can’t win through the democratic process. They're scared they can’t win when the American people decide the outcome.

A vote for Barrett is a vote to strip health care from millions. To turn back the clock on reproductive rights. To endanger immigrants. To let climate change go unchecked. To imperil efforts to end systemic racism. To put workers' rights voting rights and LGBTQ+ rights at risk.,2020-10-26 18:43:51,Twitter Web App,5721,30051
Republicans broke every rule in the book even the ones they'd made up. Barrett spent days ducking questions about issues of crucial importance.

We need to address these disparities and tackle issues like the racial wealth gap and child care head on. https://t.co/5mlMScOYsB,2020-10-20 17:00:20,Twitter Web App,421,1789
In Donald Trump's America public health officials receive death threats for helping to keep us safe. This is the result of an administration that smears science spreads conspiracies and incites violence at every turn. https://t.co/MeMr5lbY0G,2020-10-19 23:55:24,Twitter Web App,13002,58304

On Sunday I visited George Floyd’s memorial in Minneapolis. Last week would have been his 47th birthday.   As a nation we have soul searching to do. We have to reimagine our criminal justice system end systemic racism—and cement the unshakeable truth that Black Lives Matter. https://t.co/rftXRLr2So,2020-10-19 17:55:20,Twitter Web App,1333,11072

The challenges we face are enormous. But after spending the weekend with voters in Wisconsin and Minnesota I’m reminded that hope isn't given to us—it's created by us.

Last weekend @AOC and I spoke at @NewYorkerFest about what’s at stake in this election and what we’re doing about it.   We can’t afford to defeat Donald Trump by a little bit—we have to beat him by a huge amount to reassert the strength of our democracy. https://t.co/0DJA9ZIXhE,2020-10-16 19:49:48,Twitter Web App,1042,7173

This administration told the American people everything was fine—then told big donors the opposite leading them to dump their stocks.   They've protected the wealthy and well-connected at the expense of working families throughout this crisis.   https://t.co/1HJzEOprKw,2020-10-15 23:16:54,Twitter for iPhone,1723,5453

Despite what some Republicans might think democracy is the objective—and we need to fight back when it's threatened.  So make a plan. Vote early. Turn out.   The best defense against whatever Donald Trump throws our way will be an indisputable landslide victory.,2020-10-15 16:02:46,Twitter for iPhone,1975,10599
The Supreme Court will have the power to shape voting rights representation and rules governing our elections for decades—and the already conservative Court has made its disdain for our democracy clear. Confirming Amy Coney Barrett will cement the GOP's extremist minority rule.,2020-10-15 01:35:27,Twitter Web App,2579,11682
This will leave low-income people people of color and rural communities uncounted underfunded and under-represented for the next decade.   And that’s exactly what the Trump administration wants. https://t.co/aGss6L70EC,2020-10-14 22:47:56,Twitter Web App,1724,5606
Access to birth control has changed the lives and economic futures of millions of women—but we know by now how Amy Coney Barrett feels about reproductive rights.

Disney has always taken good care of its top executives and shareholders. Now its risky stock buybacks and hefty executive pay may have contributed to massive frontline worker layoffs during a pandemic. I’m demanding answers.  https://t.co/49wvXfWeBZ,2020-10-14 19:30:56,Twitter Web App,776,3663
Amy Coney Barrett has refused to answer basic questions throughout these proceedings.   But make no mistake: Her non-answers are answers too.   They’re answers about values she won’t defend rights she won’t protect and extremist beliefs she won’t condemn.,2020-10-14 17:49:46,Twitter Web App,14706,62233
If this feels personal that’s because it is. Ruth Bader Ginsburg was a personal hero for me and for millions of other women.

Mike Pence failed to keep people safe during Indiana's HIV outbreak. He failed to keep people safe when his administration locked kids in cages and dog-whistled white supremacists.

Government should be on the side of the people. But Donald Trump is and always has been incapable of that kind of leadership because it involves putting the lives of our people first. He simply doesn't know how to do anything that's not all about Donald Trump.,2020-10-01 02:22:24,Twitter Web App,2435,16116
The Supreme Court fight is about who our justice system works for: women kids workers and immigrants—or billionaires giant companies and right-wing politicians who want to shrink our democracy in order to stay in power.   Donald Trump has made it clear which side he's on. https://t.co/F8OpHZmKSG,2020-10-01 00:32:14,Twitter Web App,947,4752
A presidency on the side of the people would have meant getting masks ordering more testing and getting people ready for a pandemic—believing in science and putting people first.   That’s not what Donald Trump has done. It’s always been about taking care of himself first. https://t.co/F1u2xbgRII,2020-09-30 22:44:39,Twitter Media Studio,702,3008
He didn’t just refuse to disavow them—he asked them to “stand by.”   Donald Trump is a white supremacist and we have a moral obligation to fight back. https://t.co/GdoPbn65CB,2020-09-30 20:51:23,Twitter Web App,7547,36188
Last night Donald Trump used his final moments at the debate to spread lies and conspiracy theories about voting by mail and to intimidate Americans from going to the polls.

Joe Biden spent the final moments of the debate urging Americans to vote. Donald Trump spent the final moments of the debate trying to suppress and discount those votes.  Vote like our democracy depends on it—because it does.,2020-09-30 02:43:40,Twitter Web App,47461,227134

America has been knocked down. Millions have lost their jobs hours pay health insurance or small business.

At every turning point of this crisis Trump has failed the test of leadership—but he hasn't failed alone. Republicans sat on their hands while COVID-19 spiraled out of control and took our economy along with it. This November we need to hold them all accountable. #Debates2020,2020-09-30 01:37:38,Twitter Web App,2180,11774
Joe Biden wants to protect and expand health care. Donald Trump wants to take it away. It’s really that simple—no matter how much Trump rants raves and lies. #Debates2020,2020-09-30 01:34:40,Twitter Web App,4058,24216
More than 200000 Americans are dead.   That's not just a number. It's someone’s grandmother someone’s father someone’s best friend.   It's my brother Don Reed.

Trump is $421 million in debt.

This is about more than one man's personal tax scams. Donald Trump is a liar a cheater and a crooked businessman yes. But he's also taking advantage of a broken corrupt and unequal system that’s built for people like him to do what he did.,2020-09-28 00:04:43,Twitter Web App,42775,198617
Donald Trump paid just $750 in income taxes in 2016 and 2017. He knows better than anyone that there’s one set of rules for the wealthy and giant corporations and another for hardworking Americans—and instead of using his power to fix it he's taken advantage of it at every turn. https://t.co/b8EsstEf5T,2020-09-27 22:44:43,Twitter Web App,11756,50407

Black women are more likely to be their families’ sole breadwinners yet they’re paid less and face a steeper climb to provide that financial security.

46 years ago Richard Nixon resigned. In 1974 Democrats and Republicans united behind impeachment not out of mutual contempt for Nixon but mutual respect for the rule of law.

Donald Trump was a failed president long before his botched handling of coronavirus and this economic recession. He's spread misinformation stoked the flames of hate and let corruption run rampant since day one. For the sake of our democracy we have to vote him out.,2020-07-09 01:48:14,Twitter Web App,16527,93877

Black and Brown communities have been hit hardest by this crisis across the board—and the impending spike in evictions will be the same unless we act.

Inequality is making this pandemic worse for working people in America—and unless our government takes meaningful steps to reduce inequality and eliminate the racial wealth gap it will also make it much harder for our economy to recover from this crisis. https://t.co/1J1LOSfcxI,2020-07-06 22:05:35,Twitter Web App,525,1898

The Trump administration either doesn't have the slightest comprehension of the scope of the COVID-19 crisis—or they’re deliberately attempting to mislead the public.

Donald Trump is going out of his way to defend Confederate traitors who killed American soldiers 200 years ago in the name of white supremacy—but refuses to defend the American soldiers that Russia tried to have killed.

Qualified immunity upholds systemic racism. It perpetuates the rampant abuses of power in law enforcement.

Other countries have contained the virus. It's possible to control the spread. The U.S. simply hasn't done what we need to do—not by a long shot. We know the solutions: contact tracing testing masks.

Over 95000 Americans have died. Lines for food pantries are long. Our unemployment rate is the highest it’s ever been. But billionaires got $434 billion *richer* in the middle of a crisis.

They’re right.   William Barr chose to play politics with Trump and his cronies over ensuring equal justice under law on day one—and never looked back.   He should have resigned a long time ago. https://t.co/0mp98tDWyb,2020-05-11 23:29:27,Twitter Web App,2066,10739
Even after knowing full well the havoc that this crisis is wreaking on our economy the Trump administration has yet to come up with a bold concrete plan to prevent economic devastation. It’s inexcusable. https://t.co/cXuxpBcVE7,2020-05-11 20:59:32,Twitter Web App,891,3792
Coronavirus poses a threat to free and fair elections. But we can fix that.  We need vote by mail. We need online and same-day registration. We need early voting and extended voting hours. We need real money for governments to administer elections safely. https://t.co/hB9hEzuvc1,2020-05-11 17:39:59,Twitter Web App,2073,8119
From the school board to the statehouse @ChristyforCA25 has always stepped up for California's families.

I was so happy to see Ramona on her birthday. Ramona is battling brain cancer and because her dad is an essential worker she hasn't been able to see him.

When my daddy couldn't work after his heart attack my mother's minimum wage job saved our home. That story is written on my heart—but it's not just about my mother. It’s about millions of Americans who reach down and dig deep every day to take care of their families. https://t.co/TfjPPaJLjQ,2020-05-10 17:59:15,Twitter Web App,832,7779
I called Sonali a speech pathologist from California to thank her for doing her part to help her community in this crisis and chipping in to help elect Democrats.

Widespread testing nationwide contact tracing public manufacturing. These are health policies—but they’re also economic policies.   You don’t “reopen” the economy with a tweet. You make a plan and do the work day after day to make sure people are safe.,2020-05-10 01:02:59,Twitter Web App,9715,46732
This is a good step taken by Gov. @GavinNewsom. Voters shouldn’t have to choose between participating in our democracy and keeping themselves safe and healthy.

We're seeing the worst economic period since the Great Depression—and families who were already struggling are bearing the brunt of it.

Our response to this pandemic must recognize an unshakeable truth: Racism discrimination and biases have left the Black community in even greater danger during the coronavirus outbreak. https://t.co/f2GMivKZk3,2020-05-09 19:10:03,Twitter Web App,580,2355

I was glad to send a video message to @JaneFonda and the #FireDrillFriday crew to talk about the urgent need for an Essential Workers Bill of Rights.

The Trump administration needs to listen to disease experts medical professionals and scientists ramp up testing nationwide and put in place contact tracing efforts to ensure our communities stay safe—and we need to do it now.,2020-05-08 19:06:03,Twitter Web App,1884,10048
The U.S. economy lost 20.5 million jobs in April—the worst since the Great Depression.   It's inexcusable that the Trump administration has no plan for widespread testing and contact tracing to keep people safe and help prevent economic devastation.  https://t.co/M6GHonXjp8,2020-05-08 14:24:14,Twitter Web App,1322,4342
We need an Attorney General whose loyalty is to the Constitution not the president. William Barr must resign. https://t.co/DugO0ffDm3,2020-05-07 23:57:25,Twitter Web App,7530,31167
Donald Trump is once again putting another wealthy donor into a position that demands real experience and leadership—and at a time when survival of the USPS couldn’t be more critical. This is corruption at its worst. https://t.co/PxLCdraxOm,2020-05-07 21:58:01,Twitter Web App,1529,4459

Racism has shaped crucial aspects of our economic and political systems for generations—and this pandemic and unfolding recession are no exception. Our response to this crisis must address structural racism head-on. https://t.co/AEPD7G4WXi,2020-05-06 23:51:39,Twitter Web App,1196,4150

I’m demanding answers from Brian Miller about his ability to serve independently from an administration that seems to dodge transparency and accountability at every turn. I hope he comes prepared to answer these questions during today’s hearings.,2020-05-05 18:10:52,Twitter Web App,210,1302
In this role Miller publicly brushed off requests from Congress for information during the impeachment proceedings and the White House Counsel’s office refused to cooperate with several other congressional requests.,2020-05-05 18:10:52,Twitter Web App,162,871
In 2018 Miller joined the White House legal team counseling Donald Trump on several issues including the impeachment proceedings.,2020-05-05 18:10:51,Twitter Web App,63,285

Leilani Jordan was an essential worker who went out of her way to help elderly shoppers with their grocery needs. She risked her life to help others—we must do our part to honor her.

On today’s World Press Freedom Day we’re reminded that freedom of the press is a foundational part of democracy—and one of the most important tools for holding our leaders to account. I will fight to protect the First Amendment.,2020-05-03 19:53:26,Twitter Web App,1334,6426
If we’re going to reshape our country and our economy we need to be willing to fight for bold structural solutions to the problems we face as a nation. I’m grateful for the AAPI leaders across the country who are driving these fights in their communities.,2020-05-03 18:59:39,Twitter Web App,102,680
Discrimination has consequences—but data erasure often serves to mask those consequences. In February with input from AAPI community leaders and policy experts I called for disaggregated data. Now as we fight COVID-19 it’s more important than ever. https://t.co/lstXKVkMxf,2020-05-03 18:59:39,Twitter Web App,121,636
The AAPI community includes nearly 50 diverse racial and ethnic groups but the data we gather today doesn’t capture the richness of the communities—or significant differences on key economic and social outcomes.,2020-05-03 18:59:39,Twitter Web App,36,230

I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: Donald Trump is our most corrupt president in modern history.  But he’s just the worst symptom of a corrupt system. It’s time to root out corruption at every level and make our government work for the people.,2020-05-03 17:43:50,Twitter Web App,13772,74798
Real unemployment is soaring. But for many our economy wasn’t working even before COVID-19. As we recover we have the opportunity to create an economy that works for everyone. That begins with a government that is accountable to the people—and that is what we will deliver.,2020-05-03 14:58:38,Twitter Web App,316,1828
Every Trump administration official and business executive contemplating wasteful corrupt deals and giveaways should hear us loud and clear: Donald Trump may wink and nod at this corruption but we will not.,2020-05-03 14:58:38,Twitter Web App,326,1929
.@JoeBiden will appoint an Inspector General to review every CARES Act transaction currently evading serious scrutiny. Wasteful corrupt deals will be rooted out and undone. Suspicious transactions will be referred to the Justice Department for investigation and prosecution.,2020-05-03 14:58:38,Twitter Web App,252,1157
If Congress and the Trump administration are unwilling to act now then we will ensure that these changes are made in January 2021—both through new legislation and immediate executive commitments made by the @JoeBiden administration.,2020-05-03 14:58:38,Twitter Web App,155,770
3️⃣ Oversight: Inspectors General should be shielded from removal except for “good cause” and whistleblowers must be protected. The Congressional Oversight Commission needs subpoena power and authority to oversee all aspects of recovery including the Paycheck Protection Program.,2020-05-03 14:58:37,Twitter Web App,193,902
2️⃣ Lobbying: It's time to close loopholes and require more extensive reporting. Big corporations that apply for or accept bailout funds should not be able to engage in political spending or use their resources and political clout to lobby for bailout legislation that helps them.,2020-05-03 14:58:37,Twitter Web App,167,847
1️⃣ Conflicts of Interest: We need strong vigorously enforced protections. For example both of us have long refused to own or trade individual stocks while in office. That should be required of members of Congress and government officials responsible for the recovery programs.,2020-05-03 14:58:37,Twitter Web App,169,863
As senators overseeing the executive branch and as executive officials answering to independent oversight @JoeBiden and I know oversight is vital. As we both argued in the primary we must end corruption and guarantee a government that works for the people.,2020-05-03 14:58:37,Twitter Web App,185,858
The CARES Act imposed some oversight but when he signed it Trump said he’d ignore the law and prevent a new Inspector General from communicating with Congress. He then appointed a loyalist to that role and fired another IG independently designated to oversee the bailout.,2020-05-03 14:58:36,Twitter Web App,196,857
Trump seems to think he can direct funding for the response to this crisis based on which politicians are nice to him which states he's trying to win in November and which businesses he wants to enrich—all without any accountability.,2020-05-03 14:58:36,Twitter Web App,305,1339
Government delivers best when its actions are fair transparent and accountable.

When it comes to his handling of this pandemic Donald Trump has a view on oversight: He doesn't want any.  Make no mistake: We will keep doing our jobs and holding him accountable for his botched response to a national crisis. https://t.co/qxApwK229u,2020-05-02 23:08:48,Twitter Web App,1638,6632
Jared Kushner shouldn’t be overseeing anything—much less part of a national response to this crisis.

Celeste Williams is running to represent AR-3 because she believes no one should go broke because they get sick that all people deserve access to a world class education and that workers in America should be treated with dignity. https://t.co/1QTqqaiNuF,2020-04-30 01:31:18,Twitter Web App,87,221

Protecting our House majority is critical. But if we're going to get this government working for the people we have to expand that majority—not just maintain it.

If we don’t step up and protect the mom-and-pop shops during this pandemic companies and investors flush with cash will take this chance to gobble them up at a time when they’re most vulnerable.  @AOC and I are fighting to put a moratorium on big mergers. https://t.co/8m54q6hwCB,2020-04-29 20:34:48,Twitter Web App,529,2607
The only way we ensure that these loans are going to the people who need them is by making sure there are real strings attached to protect our workers—because you better believe the Trump administration will do whatever it can to help its wealthy friends. https://t.co/QJ1xyCYNwg,2020-04-29 17:14:05,Twitter Web App,688,2611
This virus doesn’t discriminate based on immigration status—and our response shouldn’t either.   We need to make sure everyone gets the coronavirus aid and economic relief they deserve. https://t.co/pdeqioEyYX,2020-04-29 14:58:21,Twitter Web App,613,3347
I got a note yesterday from Sarah a nurse in Utah. She and her husband are health care workers who can't afford time off to care for their girls because of student loan debt. We need to cancel student debt—during this crisis and beyond.,2020-04-29 03:12:15,Twitter Web App,4037,30259
The Trump administration’s process for distributing medical supplies appears to be driven by politics instead of public health—and we need answers.   https://t.co/atikwgrBXf,2020-04-29 00:56:44,Twitter Web App,1920,6866
Once again: If we’re only testing people with symptoms who make it to the hospital then we are far from understanding this crisis.  We need to drastically ramp up testing—and we need to do it now. https://t.co/oJ0l5ERuho,2020-04-28 23:54:57,Twitter Web App,2110,7782
Donald Trump has had an arsenal of tools at his disposal to prevent medical workers from having to make these gut-wrenching decisions—and he’s decided to not use them. This is appalling.  https://t.co/VDA3JnNfDg,2020-04-28 23:07:06,Twitter Web App,1724,4827
I’m fighting for essential workers like Christina—a critical care nurse for over 30 years who’s been using the same mask to care for infected patients for four nights in a row because her hospital doesn’t have enough PPE. #StandWithEssentialWorkers https://t.co/aPTixZ3yAJ,2020-04-28 21:40:17,Twitter Media Studio,649,2570
There is something fundamentally wrong when billionaires are getting richer in the middle of a pandemic while hospitals are struggling to find PPE essential workers are left without protections and millions of families are scrambling to make ends meet. https://t.co/Ry7n1dHVBo,2020-04-28 19:45:28,Twitter Web App,6921,20078
Economic inequity has given the big Wall Street investors and private equity firms an opportunity to gobble up small businesses at a time when they’re most vulnerable. We can’t let that happen—and @AOC and I are fighting to put a moratorium on these practices. https://t.co/e1N312CEG9,2020-04-28 16:21:30,Twitter Media Studio,1198,5288
During this crisis the last thing we need is large companies and predatory private equity firms buying out struggling small business owners. And as @AOC says these practices would have decades-long consequences. I’m proud to be her partner in this fight. https://t.co/Cwxd5Jl0Eg,2020-04-28 15:11:55,Twitter Web App,3539,19323

Reopening states too soon will come at the risk of losing progress we’ve made in slowing down the spread of coronavirus.

The U.S. has used contact tracing to stop the spread of STDs and tuberculosis and other countries have begun to use this tool to stop the spread of COVID-19. Congress must step up so we can stop chasing after this virus and start fighting it head-on.,2020-04-25 01:01:36,Twitter Web App,349,2083
Working with state local and tribal governments the @CDCgov will coordinate a strategy to hire train and deploy contact tracers who explain to people that have been in close contact with infected patients what they need to do to stay safe while protecting their privacy.,2020-04-25 01:01:36,Twitter Web App,213,1665
To confront a national crisis we need a proactive nationwide strategy—and the Trump administration is failing to come up with one.

I’m grateful to the nurses and frontline staff who took care of him but it’s hard to know that there was no family to hold his hand or to say “I love you” one more time—and no funeral for those of us who loved him to hold each other close.

The fact that we're talking about testing in terms of tens of thousands—instead of tens of millions—means we're not on top of testing. We need to ramp it up.

This is outrageous. We should use every tool at our disposal including government manufacturing or contracting if necessary to make this vaccine available to everyone who needs it.

We are not going to defeat Donald Trump with another arrogant billionaire who has argued for cutting crucial benefits for families that have earned them.

Big money is powerful but it doesn't always win. I know that firsthand.   When I ran against an incumbent Republican in the Senate Mike Bloomberg endorsed the Republican and raised big money for him.

Mike Bloomberg has dumped millions of dollars into trying to elect Republicans—including the incumbent Senate Republican I beat.   I don't care how much money he has.

Bloomberg and his companies have been accused of harassment and discrimination. But the women are bound by nondisclosures so they cannot speak.

Like so much else the Trump administration’s bungled response to the coronavirus outbreak is a mess. As president I will lead a competent administration prepared to combat outbreaks—because our public health economy and national security depend on it.,2020-02-25 20:45:25,Twitter Web App,1131,6526
The outbreak also shows how vulnerable our manufacturing sector and our economy are to disruptions in China. I’ve got a plan to bring more production back home which will create jobs and reduce our vulnerability to supply chain disruptions. https://t.co/tLHcxDS6sB,2020-02-25 20:45:25,Twitter Web App,1013,5160
We should be taking action right now to mitigate the supply chain impacts of the outbreak. The government should be helping American manufacturers find alternative sources for parts and production and helping American exporters find new purchasers.,2020-02-25 20:45:25,Twitter Web App,767,3991
The economic threat is also growing—the 1800-point drop in the Dow this week is the tip of the iceberg. Without swift action supply chain disruptions and reduced purchases will have severe long-term effects on our entire economy.,2020-02-25 20:45:24,Twitter Web App,766,4165
As the virus spreads the Chinese Communist Party’s ongoing attempts to hide what’s happening in China endangers the health of people around the world. Instead of praising Xi as Trump has done we should lead a global effort to uphold principles of open science and transparency.,2020-02-25 20:45:24,Twitter Web App,851,4681
Even worse Trump refuses to centralize crisis management in the White House—allowing CDC scientists to be overruled and sowing internal dysfunction. All this mismanagement casts doubt on how effectively he can deploy emergency funding. https://t.co/toXJxzqrrW,2020-02-25 20:45:23,Twitter Web App,961,4550
Before requesting much needed emergency funding Trump pushed again and again for dangerous budget cuts to public health and aid programs—but we win the fight against outbreaks by preparing and investing in advance not scrambling once they’ve spread. https://t.co/sLHnMDD8Xs,2020-02-25 20:45:23,Twitter Web App,1123,5127

We need to shift from trickle-down economics to grassroots-up economics. That means a #WealthTax so we can invest in families.

It's time to put power in the hands of the people—and that means strengthening and empowering our unions. I've led the effort to end so-called "right-to-work" laws and as president I'll make sure it's quick and easy to join a union. https://t.co/3NmAjgzJpV,2020-02-20 22:00:51,Twitter Web App,435,1937
Since I stepped on the #DemDebate stage our grassroots campaign has raised more than $5 million.

This country has worked for the rich and powerful for a long time and left everyone else in the dirt.

Mike Bloomberg got a number of women—who knows how many—to sign non-disclosure agreements for sexual harassment and gender discrimination.

There’s a startup gap between white entrepreneurs and Latino entrepreneurs. The principal reason is that Latino entrepreneurs don’t have the equity to get businesses started.

The end of redlining didn't cause the 2008 crash. Out-of-control greed by big banks—and the corruption that lets them control our government—caused the crash. We need to confront the shameful legacy of discrimination not lie about it like Mike Bloomberg has done. #DemDebate,2020-02-20 03:23:36,Twitter Web App,751,4116
We can't simply talk about climate change in big global terms. We have to own up to our responsibility. We need to talk about it in terms of rescuing the communities that have been damaged. #DemDebate,2020-02-20 03:22:59,Twitter Web App,248,1544

Let’s be clear: We need to get rid of the filibuster. If you're not willing to roll back the filibuster then you're giving the fossil fuel industry a veto. #DemDebate,2020-02-20 03:14:51,Twitter Web App,424,3256
Why can't we get anything passed in Washington on climate? Corruption. The first thing I want to do as president is pass my anti-corruption bill so we can start making changes and stand up to the fossil fuel industry. #DemDebate,2020-02-20 03:14:51,Twitter Web App,1275,7661

This is not just a question of Mayor Bloomberg’s character—it’s a question about electability. We’re not going to beat Donald Trump with a man who silences women with who knows how many nondisclosure agreements. That's not what we do as Democrats. #DemDebate,2020-02-20 02:54:43,Twitter Web App,1686,9838
Mayor Bloomberg has made women—dozens who knows—sign nondisclosure agreements for sexual harassment and gender discrimination.  Mr. Mayor are you willing to release all of those women from those nondisclosure agreements so we can hear their side of the story? #DemDebate,2020-02-20 02:49:52,Twitter Web App,2948,15081
I hope you heard what Mayor Bloomberg’s defense of decades of mistreatment to women was: “I’ve been nice to some women.”  That just doesn’t cut it. #DemDebate,2020-02-20 02:48:51,Twitter Web App,8386,57735
If you want to issue a real apology then it has to start with the racist intent of the plan and the willful ignorance of admitting what was happening even as people protested in your own streets. You need a different apology here Mr. Mayor. #DemDebate,2020-02-20 02:44:15,Twitter Web App,400,2565
This is about leadership and accountability. When Mayor Bloomberg apologizes for stop and frisk he talks about how it turned out. The problem is what it was designed to do to begin with: Target communities of color and Black and Brown men from the start. #DemDebate,2020-02-20 02:44:14,Twitter Web App,940,5471
Democrats take a huge risk if we just substitute one arrogant billionaire for another. It's time to have a president who is on the side of working families—and is willing to get out there and fight for them. #DemDebate https://t.co/SyxGIpcGCS,2020-02-20 02:42:08,Twitter Media Studio,2163,9991
I met a man in Reno with diabetes who gets his insulin through the VA. His sister and daughter also have diabetes—and no way to pay for it.  Three human beings right here in Nevada—sharing one insulin prescription.  That should not happen in America. #MedicareForAll #DemDebate,2020-02-20 02:38:24,Twitter Web App,941,4505
You can't stand on the #DemDebate stage and trash #MedicareForAll without a realistic plan of your own. And if you're not going to own up to the fact that you don't have a plan—or that your plan will leave people without full coverage—then you need to say so. #DemDebate,2020-02-20 02:34:25,Twitter Web App,1543,8616
Health care is a crisis in this country. My approach is we need as much help for as many people as quickly as possible. To bring in as many supporters as we can. If we don't get it all the first time we take the win and come back into the fight to ask for more. #MedicareForAll,2020-02-20 02:33:33,Twitter Web App,544,3006
Wall Street tried to stop us.  I won they lost.   We’re not going to beat Donald Trump with a candidate who makes excuses for the powerful. We need a candidate who has shown they can fight them—and win. #DemDebate,2020-02-20 02:25:32,Twitter Web App,418,2425

Democrats won’t win if we have a nominee who has a history of hiding his tax returns harassing women and supporting racist policies like stop and frisk and redlining.

AAPI communities include nearly 50 diverse racial and ethnic groups yet the aggregated data we collect hides that some AAPI families are hanging on by their fingernails.

I will diversify recruitment for government jobs including directing resources toward attracting applicants from minority-serving institutions. #AAPI2020,2020-02-13 19:17:23,Twitter Web App,42,168
@NBCAsianAmerica We need to staff our government with people who deeply understand the intersectional needs and experiences of all Americans—from housing to health care—and who reflect the diversity of the American people and that includes Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders. #AAPI2020,2020-02-13 19:16:35,Twitter Web App,46,198
@NBCAsianAmerica Personnel is policy. I’m proud to have the first Asian American campaign manager of any major presidential campaign. I’ve pledged to appoint a diverse cabinet. I’ll listen to and learn from AAPI leaders who have been at the forefront of advocating for their communities. #AAPI2020,2020-02-13 19:09:05,Twitter Web App,88,437

Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are the fastest-growing minority group in the U.S. today—working hard to thrive but still facing unique barriers to achieving their dreams. I'm a fighter for working families—and committed to fighting for AAPI families. https://t.co/H5geJ42UoE,2020-02-13 18:25:05,Twitter Media Studio,613,2822
Here’s a history lesson on the racist legacy of redlining if any presidential candidate needs a refresher. https://t.co/PiyJrEFXcV,2020-02-13 17:35:51,Twitter Media Studio,12242,35241
If we want to build a government and a country that works for everyone we need to tackle generations of racial injustice and systemic discrimination head on. I’ll listen to and learn from the AAPI leaders who have been at the forefront of this fight. https://t.co/EUaDhC6MD9,2020-02-13 17:11:26,Twitter Web App,765,2786
We need to take concrete steps to address the impact of redlining and the subprime mortgage crisis. I built an office at the @CFPB to fight lending discrimination and my housing plan helps families in formerly redlined areas to buy homes and build wealth. https://t.co/0uIziz68CR,2020-02-13 16:10:17,Twitter Web App,719,3247
The end of redlining didn't cause the 2008 crash. Out-of-control greed by Wall Street and big banks and the corruption that lets them control our government caused the crash. Predatory lenders steered families of color into the worst loans and those families lost billions.,2020-02-13 16:10:16,Twitter Web App,1098,5544
I'm surprised that someone running for the Democratic nomination thinks the economy would be better off if we just let banks be more overtly racist. We need to confront the shameful legacy of discrimination not lie about it like Mike Bloomberg has done. https://t.co/Lzavpie7Iy,2020-02-13 16:10:16,Twitter Web App,5494,23337

David Adame-Reyes was arrested for sitting on a sidewalk then sent to immigration detention. This is cruel and unjust.

A third of delegates aren't decided until Super Tuesday. What we do now matters.

Abusing official power to protect political friends and attack opponents is common in authoritarian regimes like Putin’s Russia. Trump and Barr’s conduct has no place in our democracy. To end it Congress must act—and the American people must hold them accountable in November.,2020-02-12 17:15:37,Twitter Web App,2131,9477
I am the only candidate to propose an independent DOJ task force to investigate crimes by Trump administration officials. Every Democratic candidate must commit to it—so Trump officials know they will be held accountable by career prosecutors once he is out of office.,2020-02-12 17:15:36,Twitter Web App,3591,14961
Congress must act immediately to rein in our lawless Attorney General. Barr should resign or face impeachment. And Congress should use spending power to defund the AG’s authority to interfere with anything that affects Trump his friends or his elections.,2020-02-12 17:15:36,Twitter Web App,4577,15755
Donald Trump can continue his corrupt rampages and vendettas because elected Republicans do nothing. They lack the courage and backbone shown by four career prosecutors who stepped down rather than facilitate the Attorney General’s corrupt scheme. But we are not powerless.,2020-02-12 17:15:36,Twitter Web App,1288,5950
Donald Trump is shredding the rule of law in this country. His AG overruled career prosecutors to reduce the sentence for his buddy Roger Stone after Stone committed crimes to protect him.

People are worried that the fight against Donald Trump could be unwinnable. I've been winning unwinnable fights my whole life from fighting for the CFPB to unseating an incumbent Republican.

States are trying to ban safe legal abortion outright and the Supreme Court seems to be headed in that direction as well. If we are going to protect our rights we cannot rely on the courts.

The vast majority agree on policy solutions to help end gun violence right now. But nothing gets done because the gun industry is holding our Congress hostage. We need to root out corruption in Washington. #DemDebate https://t.co/MHeLla7a1A,2020-02-08 03:39:03,Twitter Media Studio,429,1789

We build a movement by funding it from the grassroots up. That's the way I'm running my campaign. I don’t take money from federal lobbyists or billionaires at fancy fundraisers.

For generations government redlining prevented people of color from buying homes. You can't just repeal that and think everything is fine. We need race-conscious laws in education in employment and entrepreneurship to make this a country of opportunity for everyone. #DemDebate,2020-02-08 02:51:53,Twitter Web App,652,2684
We must rework our justice system from what we criminalize at the front end to how we help people come back to their communities.

States are heading toward trying to ban safe legal abortion and the Supreme Court seems headed in exactly that direction as well. We need a national law to protect a person’s right to control their own body. #DemDebate,2020-02-08 02:36:51,Twitter Web App,590,2655
Until we roll back the filibuster the gun industry is going to continue to have a veto and we'll never make the changes. We have to be willing to build a future that works not for a gun industry—but works for the rest of America and protects our children. #DemDebate,2020-02-08 02:32:57,Twitter Web App,166,926
Why can we not even get a vote in the United States Senate on background checks? Because the gun industry continues to call the shots. #DemDebate,2020-02-08 02:32:57,Twitter Web App,165,1082
We have a gun violence problem in America and it’s often communities of color that are hit hardest. We need to treat it like the public health emergency that it is. #DemDebate,2020-02-08 02:32:56,Twitter Web App,448,2861
People across the country see that our government is working great for billionaires and giant corporations while they and their children are left with less.

We are Democrats. We are on the side of everyone in America who needs health care. And when we come up against Donald Trump—the man trying to take health care from millions of people—that is what will matter. #DemDebate https://t.co/pXqwRGCG7R,2020-02-08 01:51:04,Twitter Media Studio,638,2701
Americans are losing faith in our government. They see themselves and their children with less and less. It’s not enough to simply talk about the future. We must stand up to those who now control our government and make our government work for the people instead. #DemDebate,2020-02-08 01:41:57,Twitter Web App,413,1935
We need to re-establish the rule of law in our country. I believe in an independent commission in our Justice Department that investigates crimes committed by our own government.  No one is above the law—and that includes the president of the United States. #DemDebate,2020-02-08 01:40:49,Twitter Web App,884,3933
On day one I’ll do what a president can do all by herself: Defend the Affordable Care Act and reduce the costs of prescription drugs like insulin HIV AIDS drugs and EpiPens. We are Democrats—we are on the side of those who need health care. #DemDebate,2020-02-08 01:30:48,Twitter Web App,652,3757
In 2018 36 million Americans couldn't afford to have a prescription filled. We need to bring the most help to the most people as quickly as possible. We need #MedicareForAll. #DemDebate,2020-02-08 01:29:59,Twitter Web App,250,1092
Democrats Independents and Republicans across the country understand that our government works great for the rich and powerful and no one else.

Mitch McConnell couldn't silence Coretta Scott King's voice three years ago and we won't let her enduring warning be forgotten.

We need to treat gun violence like a public health emergency. That means we collect data about where the threats come from and then reduce those threats. We have to be a nation committed to reducing gun violence. As president I will reduce gun violence by 80% over eight years.,2020-02-06 03:07:35,Twitter Web App,552,3546
Why have we done nothing on gun violence when more than 90% of Americans want us to pass background checks? The reason is corruption. It’s the power of the gun industry and the power of the NRA. We need to attack that corruption head on. #WarrenTownHall,2020-02-06 03:05:15,Twitter Web App,442,2249

I was born and raised in Oklahoma. I have 3 older brothers—1 is a Democrat the other 2 are Republicans. I ask my brothers about Eli Lilly and Amazon. You know what they have in common? They made billions of dollars in profits but paid $0 in federal income taxes. #WarrenTownHall,2020-02-06 02:28:35,Twitter Web App,342,2117
I made the decision at the beginning of this campaign that I wasn’t going to spend my time in closed-door fundraisers or selling my time to billionaires and federal lobbyists. Instead we're powered by more than 1000000 grassroots donors. Chip in at https://t.co/zK7Va0o3Yc,2020-02-06 02:18:36,Twitter Web App,256,1065
My first job was as a special education teacher. That’s where I learned the worth of every human being. That’s where I came to understand that public service and teaching are about being there for others. Donald Trump thinks others are there for him. #WarrenTownHall,2020-02-06 02:16:49,Twitter Web App,1015,7161
What today shows is what kind of human being we’re running against. Donald Trump is someone who thinks that the world is there to save him and to serve him—and he’s been that way ever since he was a kid. #WarrenTownHall,2020-02-06 02:10:19,Twitter Web App,1044,6026

We can defeat Donald Trump and root out corruption in Washington. We can defeat his hate and bigotry and build a country of our best values. We can make sure our country works for everyone not just his wealthy well-connected cronies. And we can only do it together.,2020-02-05 22:30:26,Twitter Web App,658,4534
These are hard times. People are frustrated and angry—but we must not be discouraged. Now more than ever we must choose courage and hope over fear. Now is our moment to fight back. We have defeated corruption before and we will do it again.,2020-02-05 22:30:26,Twitter Web App,714,4829
Donald Trump pressured a foreign government to interfere in our election. He undermined our diplomatic relationships and put our national security at risk. He exploits our government for his personal gain—and Republicans just voted to protect him.,2020-02-05 22:30:25,Twitter Web App,2750,15495
The New START treaty will expire exactly one year from today further increasing the risk of nuclear war. Donald Trump can agree to extend this critical treaty today—but if he does not get the job done I will move to extend the agreement on my first day in office.,2020-02-05 20:43:10,Twitter Web App,401,2138
"Corrupting an election to keep oneself in office is perhaps the most abusive and destructive violation of one's oath of office that I can imagine."   I agree @MittRomney. Voting to convict this president is an act of patriotism. Thank you for yours.,2020-02-05 19:40:12,Twitter Web App,7391,48705

Ultimately what you do—coming to town halls knocking on doors calling voters—is an act of optimism. It's an act that says: If we get out there and fight from the heart we'll save our democracy and our country.   I believe in that optimism. That's why I'm in this fight.,2020-02-05 14:59:24,Twitter Web App,2634,17715

Last night I thought about the grassroots movement we've built—over 1 million grassroots donors 3 million contributions and over 100000 selfies.

But the character of our country—and the state of our union—aren’t determined by Trump. They’re determined by our people and we’re stronger than Donald Trump. Now more than ever we must choose courage and hope over fear. #SOTU,2020-02-05 02:41:29,Twitter Web App,337,1739
These are hard times for our country. Tomorrow it looks like Republicans will continue to protect an out-of-control president rather than uphold the Constitution. #SOTU,2020-02-05 02:41:29,Twitter Web App,357,2084
Donald Trump was impeached for pressuring a foreign government to interfere in our election. That's why I'm not at his #SOTU tonight—I'm with voters in New Hampshire talking about how we're going to make our government work for them.,2020-02-05 02:41:29,Twitter Web App,4283,30460

Representation matters. I’ll ensure that our educator workforce keeps pace with the changing demographics of our schools. That also means investing in identity-affirming curricula so that students see themselves in their school work—not just one month a year but all year long.,2020-02-01 22:19:50,Twitter Web App,152,935
Continuing to militarize schools won’t improve school safety. I’ll fight to end zero-tolerance discipline which disproportionately impacts Black students and invest in restorative justice programs. I’ll also push to close the mental health provider gap in schools.,2020-02-01 22:19:49,Twitter Web App,180,1179

Donald Trump is dangerous and corrupt: He undermined our diplomatic relationships for his personal political gain. He solicited foreign interference in our elections.

I welcome tough questions and scrutiny because the free press is a cornerstone of our democracy—and every presidential candidate should be closely vetted.,2020-01-22 21:28:14,Twitter Web App,208,1542
Bloomberg News banned its reporters from investigating Democratic candidates as Mike Bloomberg runs for president. This ban puts reporters in an impossible situation and undermines a free press. Bloomberg should lift the ban and divest from Bloomberg News. https://t.co/hl2cm4nUQb,2020-01-22 21:28:14,Twitter Web App,577,2942

Trump has appointed people who are actively hostile to the mission of their government agencies—like Betsy DeVos who doesn't believe in public education.

Mitch McConnell knows the facts are damning for Donald Trump. To protect him he’s pushing through a sham trial with no witnesses and no White House documents. He’s orchestrating a cover up and trampling over the Constitution as he does it.,2020-01-21 19:45:04,Twitter Web App,8283,38411
