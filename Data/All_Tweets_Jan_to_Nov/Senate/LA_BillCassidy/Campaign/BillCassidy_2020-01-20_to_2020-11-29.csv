Thank you @realDonaldTrump for focusing on Paid Family Leave. I am leading this effort in Congress to implement a Paid Family Leave plan. We must work together to tackle kitchen-table issues for Louisiana families. #SOTU,2020-02-05 02:57:05,Twitter Web App,5,69
We are working to lower the cost of your health care and ensure you have the ability to choose the best care for your family. Doubling or tripling your taxes so the government can force you into an optionless one-size-fits-all program is not a solution. #SOTU,2020-02-05 02:42:56,Twitter Web App,8,26
All families deserve the opportunity to pick a school that is best for their children. Your zip code should not limit your child’s future. I appreciate the President bringing attention to this important issue. #SOTU,2020-02-05 02:38:27,Twitter Web App,14,63
Louisiana farmers and manufacturers are critical to our state and the USMCA gives them the ability to compete on the global market. The USMCA is a big win for the people of Louisiana. #USMCA #SOTU,2020-02-05 02:25:19,Twitter Web App,10,27
Under Republican leadership unemployment is at a fifty-year low but Washington Democrats want you to believe the country is failing.

This impeachment trial has prevented the Senate from finding solutions to the kitchen table issues facing families like creating a Paid Family Leave Program or lowering the cost of insulin. It’s time to get back to work!  https://t.co/phazRM0iSn,2020-01-30 17:00:00,TweetDeck,9,31

Any hope we have to fix the issues in our health care system will not get done as long as we are focused on impeachment. We have an election in 9 months where the people can be the judge.

Impeachment is an impediment in Washington!
