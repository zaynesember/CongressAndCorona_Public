.@realDonaldTrump’s defense team did a fantastic job at today’s #impeachment trial. Their points on the Constitutional aspects of this case are compelling. https://t.co/16OOkE2wDf,2020-01-28 02:43:17,Twitter for iPhone,146,559
It's been 75 years since the Allies liberated Auschwitz.   Let us never forget the millions of lives lost during the Holocaust and ensure that anti-Semitism is confronted and stopped in every corner of the globe. #HolocaustRemembranceDay,2020-01-27 20:26:18,TweetDeck,7,24
Impeachment is bogging down most of the Senate's time but I remain focused on doing my actual job. I enjoyed the opportunity to speak with @ChristusHealth and @ChamberSWLA this weekend to ensure their needs are addressed. https://t.co/qSKtu75nzA,2020-01-27 19:15:51,Twitter Web App,1,14
I frankly do not believe that supports the House’s impeachment case. (2/2),2020-01-27 14:27:06,TweetDeck,10,41
It sets a dangerous precedent if Congress declares obstruction of Congress against individuals who lawfully go to the courts to keep their rights from being infringed upon in this case the president’s right to executive privilege. (1/2),2020-01-27 14:26:45,TweetDeck,28,150
The American people are tired of hearing from @RepAdamSchiff. They want to know how we’re going to lower the cost of prescription drugs and how we’re going to continue to achieve economic success.,2020-01-25 15:00:00,TweetDeck,7196,27571

Currently listening to a 3rd day of Democrats' arguments. Their testimony has been repetitive except for last night when Democrats argued that the President crossed a threshold and should be removed from office before the American people decide for themselves in November.

If we lower the threshold for impeachment we’ll go from impeachment being a rare occurrence to something that happens whenever we have the president of one party and a House of Representatives of the other.   We have to keep that threshold high for the good of our nation. https://t.co/51IAteDBX8,2020-01-24 20:00:00,Twitter Media Studio,30,89
Standing with all of those marching today for the unborn. I will continue to defend the voiceless and I’m confident that together we can end abortion and build a culture where ALL human life is respected. #WhyWeMarch,2020-01-24 14:00:00,TweetDeck,107,395
We must return to solving problems facing Americans – how to lower the cost of insulin for diabetics support our veterans &amp; end surprise medical billing. As long as we debate impeachment we can do nothing else. Let’s get this done and return our focus to the people’s business. https://t.co/exHAK4Jfsf,2020-01-23 22:00:00,Twitter Media Studio,41,88
#Impeachment Advisory: I may eat another candy bar today. Would prefer crawfish but chocolate will have to do. Stay tuned for more on these breaking developments.,2020-01-23 17:59:47,Twitter Web App,11,133
My heart goes out to Matthew's family and everyone in the @ComeauxFootball community affected by this terrible tragedy.  You are all in my prayers during this difficult time.  https://t.co/c0OX9LnkzK,2020-01-23 17:15:11,TweetDeck,2,18
The House should have built its case. It’s not the Senate’s responsibility to build a case the House did not. We shouldn’t lower the threshold which the House is required to achieve to impeach a president because doing so would forever change what our Founders intended. https://t.co/AYkQpynyXz,2020-01-23 15:00:00,Twitter Media Studio,67,254
The rules laid out by @senatemajldr for the impeachment trial follow the Clinton Model which passed 100-0 in 1999. Why can’t @SenSchumer accept the same rules that he voted for only two decades ago?,2020-01-22 22:00:01,TweetDeck,10740,34284
My friend @SenatorTimScott made good on his bet to send some South Carolina popcorn my way if @LSUfootball won the National Championship. He's a great sport and I'll enjoy his popcorn - even though it's purple and orange. #GeauxTigers https://t.co/APZypapXva,2020-01-22 19:16:16,Twitter Web App,10,100
I intend to be a fair and impartial juror and consider the facts not let partisan distractions get in the way. So far the House's case is very weak. (2/2),2020-01-22 15:48:58,Twitter Web App,32,116
There’s going to be a lot of monkey dust – people throwing dust around trying to distract from the crux of the issue: Did the president obstruct Congress and abuse the power of his presidency? (1/2) https://t.co/glyEa1SyAD,2020-01-22 15:48:35,Twitter Web App,20,65
Impeachment is sucking the oxygen out of the legislative room and preventing the Senate from doing the people's business like debating #PaidFamilyLeave.  We need to get back to priorities that put the American people first.  https://t.co/KB9WayTcOU,2020-01-21 22:04:22,TweetDeck,19,54
