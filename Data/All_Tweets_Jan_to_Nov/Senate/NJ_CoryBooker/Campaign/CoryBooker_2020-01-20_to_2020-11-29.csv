In the middle of a deadly pandemic—and during an ongoing election—Senate Republicans have found a nominee in Judge Barrett who will do what they know they couldn’t do:  Subvert the will of the American people and overturn the Affordable Care Act.,2020-10-14 22:21:18,Twitter Web App,1101,4480
@ElieNYC Truly grateful for your generous words.,2020-10-14 22:18:27,Twitter for iPhone,17,1596
It would be devastating for hundreds of thousands of New Jerseyans if the Affordable Care Act was struck down.  I will fight as hard as I can to protect their access to health care. That's why I'll be voting against Judge Barrett's confirmation.  https://t.co/reoQBKxZTt,2020-10-14 18:01:43,Twitter Web App,226,1252
Donald Trump promised explicitly that he'd only nominate judges who would eliminate the Affordable Care Act.  We know that's exactly what Judge Barrett will do.,2020-10-14 16:03:37,Twitter Web App,1264,6078
We've become all too familiar with the sight of unacceptably long lines in Georgia's elections. No one should ever have to wait hours to cast their vote.  This is voter suppression. https://t.co/JzaENHMq6r,2020-10-14 02:35:36,Twitter Web App,1327,6837
I asked Amy Coney Barrett today if she believes every president should make a commitment to the peaceful transition of power.   She wouldn't answer my question.  That's profoundly concerning for a judge who aspires to join our nation's highest court.,2020-10-14 01:13:36,Twitter for iPhone,17387,81018
Our focus should be on working in a bipartisan way to get this virus under control and provide relief to those who are hurting.  Not trampling over democratic norms to rush through a Supreme Court nominee. https://t.co/uaurI2z4ez,2020-10-13 22:43:03,Twitter Web App,394,2009

It doesn't matter to Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell that millions of families rely on the Affordable Care Act. This rushed Supreme Court nomination process is a shameful attempt to strike down this lifesaving legislation. https://t.co/Q7tIXLkkob,2020-10-13 14:16:52,Twitter Web App,495,1582
Republicans have taken unprecedented steps to try and install a justice who will strike down the Affordable Care Act in the middle of the greatest public health crisis in a century.  This is not normal and it's wrong. https://t.co/NhRDfmeZ0y,2020-10-13 02:19:23,Twitter Media Studio,434,1887

Hey @brianschatz and @ChrisMurphyCT Let's go we have a US Senate to flip.   Let's all raise some $$$ for Warnock in Georgia. If he wins we can push Mitch McConnell into the minority.

Our next president needs to be committed to taking on the systemic racial inequities in this country. @JoeBiden has a plan for Black America that will close the racial wealth gap end health disparities and advance environmental justice. https://t.co/HpJkTkR1FK,2020-05-05 00:06:28,Twitter Web App,1306,6560
There's no reason for us to bail out corporations but then tell states and municipalities to go bankrupt—forcing them to lay off essential public workers like firefighters police EMTs and teachers.

I had called on @usedgov weeks ago to stop garnishing wages from those with student debt. Despite provisions in the #CARESAct that suspend this practice they still haven't halted wage garnishment.
