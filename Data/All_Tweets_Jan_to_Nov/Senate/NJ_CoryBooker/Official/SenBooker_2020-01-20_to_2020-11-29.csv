Senate Republicans know that the majority of Americans don’t want Roe v. Wade to be overturned—that the majority of Americans don’t want to see abortion criminalized. But that’s why we’re here today.

Getting ready to speak in the @SenJudiciary hearing about #WhatsAtStake as Senate Republicans ram through their illegitimate Supreme Court nominee. Health care for millions. Roe v. Wade.

Let’s be clear: nothing about today’s hearing is normal.

On November 10—just one week after the election—the Supreme Court will start hearing a Trump-backed lawsuit that could tear down the Affordable Care Act.

Donald Trump promised to nominate Justices who will “terminate” the ACA—and that’s what he has in Judge Barrett.

The continued activism and peaceful protesting of growing and diverse coalitions of Americans demanding change in the streets is why we’re going to pass federal policing legislation.

If a police officer gets fired due to misconduct charges they should NOT be able to get hired in another jurisdiction so easily—but that’s exactly what happens now because we don’t have a national database tracking that info.

In just 3 weeks 17 million people have filed for unemployment. This doesn’t even include everyone who's been unable to file. 1 in 10 American workers is out of a job.

Without the #ACA people with preexisting conditions would have difficulty getting the coverage they need to fight the #COVID19 virus—and many of us might not be able to get care now or in the future because of annual and lifetime caps that were allowed before the law was passed.,2020-03-24 01:49:47,Twitter Web App,7,17
