62% of Americans don’t want the Supreme Court to overturn the ACA. Yet Republicans keep trying to gut this law—&amp; this time they’re using the courts. I want to share with you a few stories I’ve heard from the people of CT. 1/4,2020-10-12 18:25:14,Twitter Web App,244,698
For Conner &amp; millions of others whose lives depend on the ACA Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination is terrifying. Putting her on the Supreme Court would allow Republicans to strike down in court what they cannot repeal in Congress.,2020-10-12 15:46:23,Twitter Web App,125,407
The costs of Conner’s care are astronomical. Conner is a super hero but he’s always had a sidekick—the Affordable Care Act. It has shielded him &amp; his family—giving them relief hope &amp; peace of mind. They still worry about Conner’s health but not their coverage or its costs. https://t.co/Ai6Xhz1v4Y,2020-10-12 15:46:22,Twitter Web App,90,338

FEMA funding for our storm costs? Gone. Trump’s illegally seizing FEMA’s $44 billion to pay for his Executive Orders could likely mean no money for CT disaster relief. His autocratic overreach is a disaster. Count the ways.,2020-08-10 14:45:07,Twitter for iPhone,102,279

@SenWarren Let’s end closed-door lobbyist meetings &amp; calls—making all COVID-19 relief lobbying public. Lobbyists should be forced to disclose just how they’re making money off of COVID-19. #StopCOVIDCorruption https://t.co/M3EVi6Z2YT,2020-07-30 19:24:15,Twitter Web App,66,165
@SenWarren Exactly @SenWarren. Any relief bill should start by forcing White House officials &amp; task force members who work on COVID-19 relief to disclose their financial interests &amp; ban them from working on COVID-related issues where there is a conflict of interest. #StopCOVIDCorruption,2020-07-30 19:17:35,Twitter Web App,91,251

Airlines once again put passengers last &amp; require Congress to push them to pick up the slack. Masks like seat belts &amp; no smoking are key to health &amp; safety at least for now.

Hiking fares denying refunds raising fees shrinking seats packing flights &amp; bumping travelers—airlines do masterfully. But requiring masks? Too hard.,2020-06-07 17:07:29,Twitter for iPhone,61,316

Past presidents invoked the Insurrection Act to advance de-segregation—a necessary use of this authority. Trump is doing the exact opposite—manipulating the law for his political gain while depriving people of their First Amendment rights.

Trump has threatened to use a slavery-era law to silence calls for justice from Americans protesting centuries of racist oppression. I’m introducing the CIVIL Act to impose oversight &amp; accountability to the President’s broad virtually unrestricted Insurrection Act power. https://t.co/vGAPlxryUi,2020-06-04 17:57:04,Twitter Web App,349,937

His beliefs would hurt real people like Conner a 9 year old CT boy who would have his lifesaving health care ripped away from him if Walker’s “principles” capture our courts. #StopWalker https://t.co/H2f7t0bhTZ,2020-05-06 16:54:11,Twitter Media Studio,224,543

Red lines in the sand—catering to corporate interests—ignore Americans’ real needs. Priorities should be state &amp; local aid lifelines to struggling families &amp; small businesses but also stronger oversight to make sure money meets real needs. https://t.co/W0jWik6xhv,2020-05-06 14:05:30,Twitter Web App,135,377
To teachers across CT thank you! Myself &amp; our communities greatly appreciate what you do to foster &amp; educate the next generation.

I spoke on the Senate floor to demand strong oversight scrutiny of the Paycheck Protection Program. Congress should be doing all we can to ensure that small businesses in need not billion dollar corporations receive this lifeline of federal funding. https://t.co/tYP0Uon2B1,2020-05-05 21:26:00,Twitter Media Studio,118,421
In April I asked Pence to commit to increasing protections for IGs &amp; informing Congress any time the executive branch denies a request for info. He still hasn’t answered.

In the middle of a global pandemic McConnell’s seemingly singular focus is to rush through the nomination of his anti-health care crony—Justin Walker. Forcing through judges who will gut the ACA &amp; cost millions access to health care is not only dangerous but deadly. #StopWalker,2020-05-05 17:11:46,Twitter for iPhone,512,1201
No need to shut the courthouse door to reopen the economy. McConnell’s blanket legal shield for lawbreakers has an unacceptable price—key Constitutional rights. Victims deserve their day in court. https://t.co/zjj5WeG9k8,2020-05-05 15:50:02,Twitter for iPhone,64,191
Brian Miller should be willing to support oversight reforms—like barring Trump from retaliatory firing—advocated by @SenWarren &amp; me.

I’m on the road to DC. It’s a beautiful day for a drive—but not for a Senate session that disregards the need for more COVID-19 relief. Instead of focusing on pandemic aid Mitch McConnell is putting lives at risk to confirm non-urgent nominees.,2020-05-04 15:56:57,Twitter for iPhone,758,2323
Republicans want blanket immunity for blatant lawbreaking—denying victims redress &amp; their day in court. It’s a destructive solution in search of a problem—decimating key rights &amp; using the pandemic as a deceptive pretext.,2020-05-04 14:09:21,Twitter for iPhone,90,261
Instead of real remedies for the economic &amp; health care crisis Republicans are pushing a special sweetheart legal shield—shutting courthouse doors to victims of flagrant wrongdoing.

8. Law without enforcement is dead letter. The Trump admin seemingly doesn’t respect the law unless they can be taken to court. Americans harmed by this admin’s corruption &amp; mishandling of bailout funds should be able to seek justice in the courtroom.,2020-05-02 15:07:35,Twitter for iPhone,37,174
7. Sunlight is always the best disinfectant—&amp; w/this admin we need a lot of it. There must be expanded transparency about who is receiving bailout funds &amp; how that money is being used.

5. In the Trump admin if you are a whistleblower &amp; speak truth to power the president &amp; his allies will use every tool at their disposal to retaliate. Whistleblower provisions must protect all Americans who call out wrongdoing.,2020-05-02 15:07:34,Twitter for iPhone,21,100
4. No transparency no paycheck. If the admin stonewalls oversight of how the American people’s hard-earned tax dollars are being spent they are undercutting their accountably to the public &amp; must be held responsible. https://t.co/FrOXKuLPAZ,2020-05-02 15:07:34,Twitter for iPhone,30,105
3. Anyone who thinks the executive branch will freely give information to Congress without a subpoena is gravely mistaken. The Congressional Oversight Commission needs subpoena authority to give their oversight teeth.,2020-05-02 15:07:33,Twitter for iPhone,21,95

Real accountability demands a watchdog not a lapdog to stop the waste fraud &amp; favoritism pervading this admin. @SenWarren &amp; I—along with @RepJayapal &amp; @RepSarbanes in the House—demand that oversight ethics &amp; anti-corruption be cornerstones of any future COVID-19 legislation. https://t.co/vfU6R7SLZD,2020-05-01 14:10:29,Twitter Web App,117,383

Congress is writing checks but they should not be blank. Tough oversight is essential @joshchafetz &amp; I agree. To prevent waste corruption &amp; favoritism we need to see how the Trump Admin is spending taxpayer money. https://t.co/FrOXKuLPAZ,2020-04-17 21:17:09,Twitter Web App,172,493
HAPPENING NOW: I’m holding a tele-town hall to give CT constituents the latest updates on COVID-19 &amp; answer your questions. Listen in live here: https://t.co/hLIbzlolGP https://t.co/h4INmyXpzv,2020-04-17 19:36:26,Twitter Web App,25,89
Today at 3:30pm I’m hosting a tele-town hall to give CT constituents an update on COVID-19 &amp; answer your questions. Tune in: https://t.co/hLIbzlolGP https://t.co/6RDi7923VU,2020-04-17 19:07:53,Twitter Web App,20,55
Making sure taxpayer money goes to deserving small businesses—not politically connected special interests—requires critical oversight. We need to strengthen safeguards.,2020-04-17 17:13:33,Twitter Web App,48,264
Free money for hedge funds—not our goal for PPP. This is exactly why tough oversight &amp; transparency are vital. https://t.co/DNWtqgDzbv,2020-04-17 17:13:33,Twitter Web App,164,404
Enforcers must stop scammers &amp; bottom feeders from exploiting COVID-19 &amp; endangering health. False pitches &amp; sky-high price hikes should be halted &amp; prosecuted.https://t.co/OI7GGkFsZ2,2020-04-17 13:02:24,Twitter for iPhone,56,168
The Navy along with Pentagon leaders have downplayed health hazards—putting servicemembers at serious risk. Infectious disease like COVID-19 is deeply dangerous requiring stronger action.,2020-04-17 00:06:45,Twitter for iPhone,81,311
I’m demanding to know what more the Navy can do to protect sailors from COVID-19. 18 colleagues agree: The USS THEODORE ROOSEVELT’s painful experience must lead to better prevention &amp; response. Lives are at stake. https://t.co/u5Q8smg95X,2020-04-17 00:06:45,Twitter for iPhone,213,719
Banks seizing CARES checks must stop. Get a grip on banking greed. Congress must do it if Trump Treasury officials won’t. This money was meant for food medicine rent &amp; other struggling families’ needs. Not overdrawn accounts. Banks need to care. https://t.co/OPI7i9m0PS,2020-04-16 18:53:55,Twitter Web App,191,518
Many Americans stranded abroad during the COVID-19 crisis had to pay sky-high costs to come home. This bill will reimburse Americans for often outrageous airline charges &amp; State Dept flights.  https://t.co/AYflpRVuRz,2020-04-16 17:14:03,Twitter Web App,34,131
Our goal was to help people not banks. The CARES checks are a lifeline for struggling families not a money grab for big finance corporations. Treasury must step up to slap down the banks. https://t.co/DoJunHiT49,2020-04-16 13:58:47,Twitter for iPhone,166,447
Please remember you are not alone. Safe Futures (860-701-6000) &amp; @CTCADV (888-774-2900) are here to help. I’m also fighting for further funding for groups who provide essential support.,2020-04-15 23:29:31,Twitter Web App,36,80
Shocking sickening stories of domestic violence in our CT communities. Staying at home for COVID-19 is forcing victims &amp; survivors of domestic violence into increasingly dangerous situations. https://t.co/PpVAfsb29p,2020-04-15 23:29:30,Twitter Web App,50,107
Absolutely alarming. Plummeting testing is fraught with peril—&amp; reflects White House falsity. Massive testing not less is necessary for economic recovery. https://t.co/g2SMcRHihQ,2020-04-15 21:11:46,Twitter Web App,429,886
Congress intended for $25B in passenger airline grants to be used as direct payroll aid not loans. These new conditions could cause employee cuts. Sec. Mnuchin must reverse course—if not Congress should act to restore the original purpose of these grants. https://t.co/juKZcDBW6K,2020-04-15 19:05:23,Twitter Web App,162,409
Gall. By slowing production to add his name Trump delays when people will receive these critical checks—all for his political gain. What’s more it’s Americans’ money—taxpayer funds—not his. https://t.co/u9oGUjTolJ,2020-04-15 17:56:41,Twitter for iPhone,373,982
Privacy protection must be a strict precondition stringently enforced to any app that tracks people’s movements—by the feds Google or anyone else.,2020-04-15 16:23:41,Twitter Web App,15,105
The plan to re-open America hinges on massive testing—along with contact tracing &amp; effective treatment. The Trump Admin has failed on testing since day one. The message remains clear: Make the tests. https://t.co/rP4KWy5bst,2020-04-15 16:23:41,Twitter Web App,90,292
Trump’s bombastic finger pointing is no substitute for real fact finding. I’m working on creating an independent bipartisan commission—to be included in an upcoming relief package &amp; begin work when we surmount this crisis. Future preparedness will help save lives.,2020-04-15 14:59:16,Twitter Web App,72,382
Instead of Trump falsely blaming the WHO or his faux review America needs a Pandemic Review Commission—an independent bipartisan investigation just like after 9/11. https://t.co/9E0u67xHga,2020-04-15 14:59:16,Twitter Web App,364,1318
Republican roadblocks to relief payments—affecting millions—must be removed. No one should be denied vital help. Corrections must be made in the next emergency package. https://t.co/TZchVamPCv,2020-04-15 13:52:15,Twitter Web App,67,213
Unacceptable. During a pandemic the last thing we should do is underfund &amp; undermine the WHO. They warned about an imminent insidious threat which Trump &amp; his Admin chose to ignore.  https://t.co/unV0nyjVLr,2020-04-15 00:37:49,Twitter for iPhone,834,2871
Staying connected is vital during this pandemic. FCC's Lifeline program is ensuring millions of veterans seniors &amp; low-income households can access essential broadband &amp; phone services.

I’m supporting efforts to vote remotely—so the Senate can be safe &amp; effective. Having argued cases in the Supreme Court I couldn’t have imagined doing it by teleconference. The unimaginable is now necessary.,2020-04-13 21:23:07,Twitter for iPhone,98,480
If the US Supreme Court can work remotely the Senate can vote remotely. https://t.co/tEu9X8K5og,2020-04-13 21:23:06,Twitter for iPhone,283,1036
Deliciously brightening the day for health care heroes who spent Easter away from their families. Thanks to Food for The Front Lines for delivering food purchased from local restaurants. A win-win! https://t.co/4QIQSMhVHd,2020-04-13 19:10:15,Twitter for iPhone,45,166
The USPS is a lifeline for many; transporting medicines test kits &amp; PPE—plus delivering our votes in November. The Trump Admin should stop blocking efforts to provide them pivotal funding. https://t.co/Z9CLSZsxt8,2020-04-13 17:47:38,Twitter for iPhone,209,600
Local journalism closures cost us all—undercutting information &amp; community. That’s why I’m fighting to provide additional resources to support independent reporting &amp; media outlets in the next emergency relief bill. https://t.co/aZhbDzeaAV,2020-04-13 16:32:20,Twitter Web App,50,183
Any action for states must include our territories like Puerto Rico. The island is still recovering from multiple natural disasters as it faces this pandemic. Waive the 25% cost share for assistance &amp; cover 100% of the disaster loans.,2020-04-13 14:16:23,Twitter for iPhone,76,265
Having failed to provide critical medical equipment the least the Trump Admin can do is cover states’ cost share. If not Congress must act to waive states’ 25% funding share in the next relief package. Red state or blue it’s real money.,2020-04-13 14:16:23,Twitter for iPhone,334,1299
A happy healthy Easter to all who celebrate. Hoping you are able to share this wonderful holiday with friends &amp; family—even if only remotely this year. Stay safe.,2020-04-12 14:21:03,Twitter for iPhone,68,700

Stop the #COVID19 snake oil scammers—like Alex Jones—exploiting widespread anxiety &amp; anguish. Bottom feeders are hawking fake remedies that have serious side effects. Hardly harmless: Beware. https://t.co/8peCPEZ9pk,2020-04-10 21:06:10,Twitter Web App,183,539
A commission—much like what was conducted after 9/11—is absolutely necessary to understand the mistakes that were made &amp; develop the lessons learned. Our future depends on it.,2020-04-10 19:40:14,Twitter Web App,121,496
Once we overcome this heartbreaking crisis the American people deserve to understand how &amp; why we were so unprepared. I’m announcing legislation with @RepAdamSchiff @SenFeinstein @SenKamalaHarris &amp; @SenMarkey creating a nonpartisan independent investigation to do just that.,2020-04-10 19:40:14,Twitter Web App,597,2599
Trump’s calculated strategy is to designate acting inspectors general instead of nominating permanent ones. That way he can say “you’re fired” when they conduct real oversight.,2020-04-10 01:12:07,Twitter for iPhone,308,832
The danger to the independence of inspectors general is unprecedented. That’s why I’m working on reforms to prevent Trump &amp; his admin from undercutting government accountability. https://t.co/e5CPzqJ2Ca,2020-04-10 01:12:06,Twitter for iPhone,454,1369
I’m demanding that OSHA adopt immediate standards to protect all frontline workers risking their lives.

Hunger is everywhere just like COVID-19. I visited mobile CT Food Banks in Hamden &amp; East Haven this week. 700+ families were served &amp; countless others turned away when food ran out. Heartfelt thanks to the volunteers—more federal support is necessary. https://t.co/mnJNPcGXo9,2020-04-09 21:30:48,Twitter Web App,63,158
Thousands of Americans are still stranded overseas &amp; lack the funds to pay the sky-high costs to get back. I’m leading 10 colleagues in demanding Sec.

Yesterday afternoon I visited another @CTFoodBank Mobile Pantry where they served 400 families in an hour &amp; had to turn people away after running out of food. The demand for assistance is growing every day &amp; need for allocated federal dollars is mission critical. https://t.co/o8Pt6FN6BP,2020-04-09 15:35:08,Twitter for iPhone,60,143
Trump wants to kill the messenger—the WHO. It warned about an imminent insidious pandemic. Trump dismissed &amp; demeaned the message &amp; now seeks to decimate WHO. Unacceptable. https://t.co/keAb73wgSc,2020-04-08 23:57:50,Twitter Web App,459,1185
To all who are celebrating Passover as it begins tonight Chag Pesach Sameach to you &amp; yours from the Blumenthals.

Deeply horrific. An 8-month pregnant woman with flu symptoms was arrested by CBP denied medical care &amp; forced to give birth standing up. This inhumane treatment must end. I've led 12 colleagues in demanding a DHS investigation &amp; @ACLU filed a complaint. https://t.co/wuZrOAhnRq,2020-04-08 21:34:10,Twitter for iPhone,2825,3919
Reliable local news is even more vital during COVID-19 but outlets are struggling to make ends meet. Future COVID relief funding must include support for local journalism &amp; media so they can continue providing communities answers to critical questions &amp; lifesaving info. https://t.co/lpYn4VaKLy,2020-04-08 20:19:18,Twitter for iPhone,66,215
.@CTFoodBank is doing vital work to feed our communities during this crisis. Speaking w/organizers of the mobile pantry made it crystal clear the demand is huge &amp; resources are limited. Just today at one location they served 350+ people in an hour. More fed support must be given. https://t.co/t7OBOHnYHk,2020-04-07 23:59:15,Twitter for iPhone,23,56

After Modly’s terrible judgment &amp; offensive comments McPherson may not have big shoes to fill but he has a big job to do—protect our sailors from COVID-19 &amp; right the Navy’s ship.,2020-04-07 20:32:41,Twitter for iPhone,48,255
Modly had to go but his taking the fall still leaves the need for Pentagon leadership accountability. We need to know who else was involved in removing a Navy captain doing his duty to protect his sailors. A full IG investigation is no less necessary. https://t.co/SyVfmA5pgB,2020-04-07 20:32:40,Twitter for iPhone,127,501
Lawmakers who fail to speak up now will be forever remembered as accomplices in Donald Trump’s calculated campaign to evade accountability.,2020-04-07 19:34:52,Twitter for iPhone,218,769
This blatant cover-up scheme is outrageous. It has no purpose except to derail&amp;defang oversight. To my Republican colleagues who’ve built careers advocating spending oversight: you must take a stand as Trump sidelines scrutiny over the largest relief funding bill in our history. https://t.co/j3mf1n5xq0,2020-04-07 19:34:52,Twitter for iPhone,406,1096
Tragedy &amp; scandal—this report documents both as well as Trump’s deadly abdication of national leadership.

The facts &amp; practices unearthed by researchers in recent weeks are alarming—we should be concerned about what remains hidden. As Zoom becomes embedded in Americans’ daily lives we urgently need a full &amp; transparent investigation of its privacy &amp; security.,2020-04-07 13:05:53,Twitter for iPhone,41,170
I am calling on FTC to investigate @zoom_us. Zoom’s pattern of security failures &amp; privacy infringements should have drawn the FTC’s attention &amp; scrutiny long ago. Advertising privacy features that do not exist is clearly a deceptive act.,2020-04-07 13:05:52,Twitter for iPhone,177,623
CAPT Crozier’s fireable “mistake” was protecting his sailors' health &amp; safety. All sailors—in fact all servicemembers—deserve a commanding officer who puts them first.,2020-04-07 01:20:56,Twitter for iPhone,215,1053
At today’s press briefing Trump said CAPT Crozier made a “mistake” &amp; he may “look into it.” Here’s who made a shameful mistake: Modly Esper &amp; all the Navy brass who aided &amp; abetted them. An IG investigation &amp; Senate hearing should hold them accountable.,2020-04-07 01:00:19,Twitter for iPhone,916,3441

I remain deeply concerned about sailors’ safety on the USS Roosevelt— &amp; Navy ships &amp; subs globally. Evacuations &amp; testing must be accelerated to prevent spread &amp; ensure quick recovery. Decisive leadership that prioritizes the health of our men &amp; women in uniform is critical.,2020-04-06 20:36:42,Twitter for iPhone,113,464
Acting Sec. Modly is just that—acting. He has not been confirmed by the Senate for this role. DOD accountability is vital—enforced by the Senate Armed Services Committee in hearings &amp; budget if necessary.,2020-04-06 20:36:42,Twitter for iPhone,153,577
Modly should be removed unceremoniously for these shocking remarks—especially after failing to protect sailors’ safety &amp; health. He has betrayed their trust. DoD IG must immediately launch an investigation. https://t.co/RAZTWit0oU,2020-04-06 18:37:07,Twitter for iPhone,1531,4083
Help is vital against the danger of domestic violence—viciously compounded by virus-related stay-at-home requirements.

Big banks like BoA need to do the right thing— &amp; fast. Refusing PPP loans to small businesses just because they haven’t borrowed before won’t cut it. Perhaps they’ve forgotten their own bailouts.https://t.co/P2M4CpO37M,2020-04-05 21:40:59,Twitter for iPhone,160,449

If Republicans refuse to hear from Bolton &amp; other witnesses it is their fault &amp; their fault alone.,2020-01-27 23:43:29,Twitter for iPhone,7,45
Much has been said about the role of the Chief Justice in an impeachment trial but make no mistake: the Senate will decide whether Bolton &amp; others testify. Senate Republicans are responsible for taking Bolton up on his offer to tell his story. https://t.co/I7rANXQQht,2020-01-27 23:43:28,Twitter for iPhone,106,382

After Bolton’s bombshell we need to subpoena him this moment not wait until the White House lawyers are done—&amp; we should subpoena his book manuscript &amp; notes.,2020-01-27 20:26:23,Twitter for iPhone,236,983
The White House lawyers seem to be in a bubble of denial—denial of the factual &amp; legal reality. The rest of America is talking about John Bolton &amp; the White House lawyers seem to ignore him.,2020-01-27 20:26:23,Twitter for iPhone,108,547
The Starr presentation was highfalutin gobbledygook &amp; gimmickry. The legal argument was total sophistry dressed up with a big name (although not one that gives it any credibility).,2020-01-27 20:26:23,Twitter for iPhone,66,337
After the lightning bolt of the Bolton draft it was completely surreal to sit on the Senate Floor &amp; hear absolutely nothing about it.,2020-01-27 20:26:22,Twitter for iPhone,322,1591
If GOP senators refuse to hear from Bolton now they will most certainly hear from him when he releases his book in March. Wouldn’t it be better to get the facts before we vote? The American people deserve the truth during the trial not after.,2020-01-27 18:08:31,Twitter for iPhone,128,463
Trump is calling Bolton a liar on Twitter but the President won’t say that under oath (&amp; won’t let his aides testify on the question). Bolton is happy to tell all he knows to the Senate—if only Republican senators will hear him out.,2020-01-27 18:08:30,Twitter for iPhone,80,319
First the House process was "rushed" now GOP senators claim getting Bolton’s testimony will take too long. They’re wrong. He wants to testify. If Trump sues to stop Bolton he runs against the 1st Amendment. Plus SCOTUS frowns on the Executive trying to tell Congress what to do,2020-01-27 18:08:30,Twitter for iPhone,383,1158

The magical moderate Republicans hold the keys to a real full fair impeachment trial. This week they can unlock the truth by voting for witnesses &amp; documents. Do they have the moral backbone to be real or just a myth? Seeing is believing.,2020-01-27 03:20:38,Twitter for iPhone,700,3154
No executive privilege or imaginary immunity can excuse failing to learn bombshell facts from Bolton. They must be heard for a full fair trial. Subpoena the drafts.,2020-01-27 02:21:09,Twitter for iPhone,180,751
