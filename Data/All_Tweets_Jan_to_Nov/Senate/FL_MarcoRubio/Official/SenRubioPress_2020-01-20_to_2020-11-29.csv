Just as #China treats #Huawei's 5G role as political the UK &amp; other European govts must address the politics of China's Intelligence Law the costs of securing 5G networks &amp; complicity in #Xinjiang abuses.  We must be honest about the risks. The cost is not just the price tag.,2020-01-27 23:30:39,Twitter Web App,798,1127

Mood of @UKParliament is clear: the UK’s gov't should delay its decision on #Huawei. 5G needs a broader perspective than looking for the cheapest price. #China's subsidies are not altruistic. UK decision must include human rights security &amp; real costs of mitigating risk.,2020-01-27 23:24:56,Twitter Web App,744,923
.@FiniteStateInc found "#Huawei devices to be less secure than comparable devices from other vendors" and "the security posture of [Huawei] devices is not improving over time."  5G ties economic security &amp; nat'l security more closely together. Such risks are unacceptable.  3/3,2020-01-27 23:09:47,Twitter Web App,23,47
The UK’s Gov't experts focused on reviewing Huawei's risks found "serious and systematic defects in Huawei's software engineering and cyber security competence."  The British people deserve the best and it’s not #Huawei. 2/3  https://t.co/cnacA2Q0cK,2020-01-27 23:09:47,Twitter Web App,19,40
Supporters of #Huawei's place in UK 5G networks say “we have to take the advice of the experts.”  Agreed!
