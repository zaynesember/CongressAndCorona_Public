Local media is reporting on how community bank @SmartBank made 1700 #ppploans for $240 million to #smallbiz   https://t.co/sDIZL0qK0r  Meanwhile national media focuses on how 0.3% of funds in 1st round of #PPP went to publicly traded companies  https://t.co/VJZGA1aJ8V,2020-05-01 16:43:37,Twitter for iPhone,42,155

We keep hearing from many that #PPP doesn’t work for some #SmallBiz who need money for operations instead of re-hires.

#PPP UPDATE 5/7: 4th:Claim that we don’t need more $ approved yet because very little has been disbursed is WRONG  Amount disbursed is irrelevant to need for additional funds.

#PPP NOTES 2/3: PPP has some serious implementation issues  Yet over 3500 lenders have approved over 500000 #PPPloans at rate of over $3 billion per hour.   Truethe program isn’t ideal yet.

Everyone is now on notice  Sometime next week #PPP will stop &amp; no more #PPPloans will be madeleaving millions of #smallbusiness locked out  When that moment arrives it will be because a simple effort to add $250 billion to program was taken hostage on unrelated matters https://t.co/hbyoOOOAKY,2020-04-09 16:11:56,Twitter for iPad,372,717
This is simple. They blocked money for #PPP because unfortunately Senate democratic leaders view every request as a chance to get something they want in return.

Argument made on floor by a Senate democrat that we shouldn’t put more funds in #PPP until it’s glitches are fixed misses the point.   Money is a big cause of some of the glitches.   The fear it will run out of money &amp; leave some #smallbusiness behind is creating a demand crunch.,2020-04-09 14:37:00,Twitter for iPad,141,521
Unfortunately Senate Democrats are about to block more money for #PPPloans   Not because they oppose it but because they want others things included.

This is NOT accurate.   The issue was not that banks are giving preference to their customers. The issue was that one bank was denying their own customers if they didn’t have a loan or credit card with them.

Good news on #PPP.   @senatemajldr is working with @SenSchumer &amp; hopes to approve additional funding by voice vote during the Senate’s pro forma session this week on Thursday 9 April.  We will need at least another $200-$250 billion for #PPPloan,2020-04-07 15:28:52,Twitter for iPad,181,538
The fear that #PPP will run out of money is creating tremendous anxiety among #SmallBusiness.   We have days NOT weeks to address this.

With only 6 days to launch a massive emergency program for over 90% of companiesglitches will happen.  But #PPP will get better as:  1. SBA portal adds capacity;&amp;  2.

UPDATE on #PPP in thread below: 1/7: Several large FinTech companies are ready to join as lenders as soon as @USTreasury releases their nonbank lender form.

UPDATE:Progress on the #PPP item I tweeted about on Saturday.  Today @federalreserve announced it will be creating a new facility to help lenders make #PPPloans.

Yes rules for #PPPloans posted late Thu by @USTreasury b/c original rules too complicated  And yes many lenders still confused  Confusion being addressed &amp; online lenders starting soon  This is a new program launched with just 7 days it must/will improve  https://t.co/wutqdOMHi9,2020-04-04 14:29:28,Twitter for iPad,96,405

Good news.   @BankofAmerica announced this morning they are opening up #Ppploans to all small business account holders irrespective of whether or not they have a loan or credit card.  Thank you for making the right decision.,2020-04-04 13:22:27,Twitter for iPad,543,2409
When you launch something this unprecedented &amp; far reachingjust 7 days after it became lawyou are going to have some problems  The GOOD NEWS is every problem we saw on Day One of #Ppploans can be fixed  We will stay on it to make sure it gets better each day forward  13/13,2020-04-04 11:16:23,Twitter for iPad,76,499
Eighth issue is money. Based on the demand we saw on Day One it is clear we will need more money for #PPP by late May.  Our rough estimate is that if 2/3 of the lenders that will participate in #PPPloans aren’t up &amp; running yetthe $349 billion will run out around 6 June. 12/13,2020-04-04 11:16:23,Twitter for iPad,62,247
Seventh issue is that some community banks have reported issues with accessing the AWS portal which @SBAgov uses to provide access to non-SBA lenders.   We have discussed this also with SBA which assured us they are addressing this problem. 11/13,2020-04-04 11:16:23,Twitter for iPad,23,117
Sixth issue is that E-Tran the @SBAgov internal system for loan applications has been slow due to the volume of applications Friday.   SBA has contracted with Amazon Web Services to ensure E-Tran system issues are resolved moving forward.  10/13,2020-04-04 11:16:23,Twitter for iPad,34,120
Fifth issue is that In calculating avg monthly payroll to determine #Ppploans amount we need @SBAgov to make clear our intent when writing the bill that gross payroll would be applied to calculation to ensure federal tax withholding &amp; FICA burden isn’t on #smallbusiness 9/13,2020-04-04 11:16:23,Twitter for iPad,39,192
Fourth issue is that the @SBAgov interim final rule has contradicting guidance determining whether #SmallBusiness owners should include independent contractors 1099’s in payroll cost calculation. 8/13,2020-04-04 11:16:22,Twitter for iPad,34,191
Third issue is that in order for lenders to confidently participate they need further clarity on:  - @SBAgov affiliation rules for #SmallBusiness &amp; 501(c)(3)  - Inconsistency on general eligiblity requirements for #Ppploans  I expect that very early next week as well.  7/13,2020-04-04 11:16:22,Twitter for iPad,31,129
Second issue is that because of requirement in @SBAgov interim final rule that lenders hold loans for 7 weeks before they can be purchasedwe will need a purchase mechanism through @USTreasury or @federalreserve ASAP in order for community banks &amp; FinTech to make #Ppploans 6/13,2020-04-04 11:16:22,Twitter for iPad,32,138
The good news is multiple FinTechs including @PayPal &amp; other online lenders are readyable &amp; willing to process #PPPloans for them &amp; anyone else.But they need @USTreasury to release application for nonbank lenders to become certified.   I expect that very early next week. 5/13,2020-04-04 11:16:22,Twitter for iPad,49,210
First issue is that for now most banks only providing #PPPloans to existing clients because the @SBAgov interim final rule only exempts money- laundering requirements for existing customers. But that makes it difficult for #SmallBusiness if they are denied by their bank. 4/13,2020-04-04 11:16:21,Twitter for iPad,28,135
On Friday we had various &amp; extensive conversations with @SBAgov &amp; @USTreasury about the issues that emerged on day one of #PPPloans. I expect that early next week they will be releasing additional guidance that should provide clarity &amp; help resolve many of these issues 3/13,2020-04-04 11:16:21,Twitter for iPad,26,120
Day one saw complications you would expect with unprecedented $349 BILLION emergency plan passed just 7 days ago  Despite this as of 6:06 pm Friday 13669 #SmallBusiness owners received #Ppploans valued at more than $4.3B   However a number of outstanding issues to address 2/13,2020-04-04 11:16:21,Twitter for iPad,35,130

The requirement that a #SmallBusiness not just have a business account but also a loan or credit card is NOT in the law we wrote &amp; passed or in the regulations.

Virtually every American was either laid off or has family members &amp; friends who have.   I know AN ENTIRE IMMEDIATE FAMILY (husbandwifetwo adult children &amp; their 2 spouses) all laid off in last 72 hours.

Small/mid size business owners are also employees themselves. The trauma this is inflicting on themtheir employees &amp; our country is severe.   We don’t have the luxury of days to kick around ideas or try to one-up each other. We need to reach agreement &amp; act now. 5/5,2020-03-20 10:55:52,Twitter for iPad,74,335
Small/mid size employers don’t have billion $ lines of credit to draw down on. They don’t have a few weeks before they run out of operating cash. They are (often tearfully) laying off workers all over the countryby the minute because they have no choice. 4/5,2020-03-20 10:55:52,Twitter for iPad,59,276
Goal is to quicklyprovide employers enough cash to keep workers on payroll &amp; bring back laid off workers onto payrollfor the next 5 to 6 weeks.

We only have 3 months of information on  #Covid_19  We have created the perception that younger people have nothing to worry about.   We now need to stop saying that.

5. This will NOT exclude any industry. It WILL apply to s corp C Corp non-profits partnerships sole practitioners etc. who meet the expanded criteria for small business. Again the goal is to be inclusive not exclusive. 6/7,2020-03-19 12:16:48,Twitter for iPad,69,330

3. Existing 7(a) lenders ready to go right away. But everyone agrees that the list lenders involved needs to be expanded rapidly &amp; we create a process to do that. The ideal outcome is for small businesses to be able to do all this with their own bank if they want. 4/7,2020-03-19 12:16:48,Twitter for iPad,41,163
2. This is NOT some traditional SBA direct loan or program. We are using many of the guidelines &amp; infrastructure of the 7(a) program but they will NOT be calling a government agency for this help. It will be handled by a bankcredit union or other lender in their community. 3/7,2020-03-19 12:16:48,Twitter for iPad,44,188
1. What we are discussing are FORGIVEABLE Loans. Whatever they take out from this assistance program &amp; use for payroll &amp; business and rent/lease/mortgage will NOT have to be repaid.
