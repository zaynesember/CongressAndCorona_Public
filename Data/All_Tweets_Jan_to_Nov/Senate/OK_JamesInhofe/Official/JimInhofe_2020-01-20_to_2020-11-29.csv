.@realDonaldTrump's 2021 Budget Request includes a MAJOR investment in Oklahoma veterans with funding to build a new Tulsa VA hospital &amp; plans for a transformative behavioral health facility in Muskogee so we can lead the region in veterans care and grow our role within the VA. https://t.co/vfogfBF7vr,2020-02-10 21:48:21,TweetDeck,43,190
Please join me in honoring Sgt. 1st Class Javier Gutierrez of San Antonio Texas and Sgt. 1st Class Antonio Rodriguez of Las Cruces NM who made the ultimate sacrifice while serving our nation overseas.

Glad to see President Trump's guests Oklahomans Kelli and Gage Hake in the #SOTU audience. Their husband and father Staff Sergeant Hake was killed by a roadside bomb supplied by Soleimani. @realDonaldTrump's peace through strength strategy took out monsters like Soleimani.,2020-02-08 20:00:00,TweetDeck,35,167
After successful conservation efforts the American Burying Beetle will soon be downlisted by @POTUS' Fish and Wildlife Service bringing much needed regulatory relief to Oklahomans burdened with unnecessary and excessive red tape.  Another deregulation win for @POTUS. https://t.co/M9XfxeALl9,2020-02-08 15:00:00,TweetDeck,83,381
Oklahoma and other stakeholders have and will continue working to avoid a costly and burdensome ESA listing for the Lesser Prairie Chicken. Watch below for an update on the LPC from the Assistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife. ⬇️ https://t.co/WC1BClTyC9,2020-02-07 23:00:00,TweetDeck,17,87
Since taking office @realDonaldTrump has continually emphasized the importance of domestic energy dominance and his #SOTU was no different. The war on fossil fuels is over and we’re seeing the positive results—we are now the world leader in oil and gas production.,2020-02-07 16:51:01,TweetDeck,44,258
For too long the State Department’s focus in Africa has been aid not trade. With the enactment of #USMCA @realDonaldTrump has paved the way for it to be used as a model for future agreements including with African nations.

.@realDonaldTrump made it clear in his #SOTU: he’s committed to rebuilding our military and taking care of our veterans. The numbers prove it. Since @POTUS took office we’ve appropriated $2.2 trillion to rebuild our military and established the U.S. Space Force in the FY20 NDAA.,2020-02-06 17:38:27,TweetDeck,66,333
I finally have good news for you. After the biased unprecedented House impeachment process a fair Senate trial has acquitted @realDonaldTrump. It’s over. https://t.co/vhJvkEaLCc,2020-02-05 21:50:39,TweetDeck,653,3053

Despite Democrat efforts to distract citizens and stain his presidency with a partisan and unprecedented impeachment process @realDonaldTrump is working hard to better our economy military and judicial system.

It's Day 10 of the impeachment trial and we are nearing the end. It’s time to acquit @realDonaldTrump of both counts against him.    Hopefully my next update will be after the final vote—and the Senate &amp;POTUS can get back to work for the American people.

@USAfricaCommand @Southcom China and Russia are the central challenge to our security - but their influence isn't limited to Europe &amp; the Indo-Pacific. Both countries view Africa &amp; Latin America as critical battlefields.

Oklahoma farmers businesses and manufacturers won today with @realDonaldTrump’s #USMCA signing. The USMCA re-emphasizes President Trump’s commitment to a trade vision that puts America first.

Over the last two days we’ve heard @realDonaldTrump’s legal team lay out their defense. They’ve consistently and convincingly refuted all of the Dems’ claims. Period.

We must fight every day so abortion doesn't claim any more unborn babies.

For the first time since 2013 more Americans are pro-life (49%) rather than pro-abortion (46%). By highlighting the value of all human life we’re making progress to end the abortion on demand culture. But the fight isn’t nearly over.  https://t.co/9ogIceccMB,2020-01-25 13:15:00,TweetDeck,20,68
If you watch the liberal news media today you would think no one is advocating for the unborn or standing up for the right to life. Thank goodness the media has it wrong.  Read more in my @TheOklahoman_ op-ed ⬇️ https://t.co/9ogIceccMB,2020-01-25 13:00:00,TweetDeck,25,66

In Congress I'm leading the fight for pro-life values. When you are pro-life you believe life begins at conception.
