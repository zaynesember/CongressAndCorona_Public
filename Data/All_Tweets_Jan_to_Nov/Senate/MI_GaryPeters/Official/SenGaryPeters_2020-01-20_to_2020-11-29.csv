Every day Michiganders are targeted by sophisticated &amp; formidable cyber-attacks that threaten the security of their personal info.  That’s why I introduced bipartisan legislation to ensure states have a dedicated professional to help combat these complex evolving threats. https://t.co/V7Oc7Cingx,2020-01-24 15:40:27,TweetDeck,29,81

This is outrageous! I will fight against any effort to cut Medicare or Social Security. Michigan seniors have earned these benefits through a lifetime of hard work and we can’t allow this sacred promise to be broken. https://t.co/5Bt0d13Mja,2020-01-23 14:15:18,Twitter for iPhone,615,1467
It’s bad enough that students were scammed by for-profit institutions—they shouldn’t be saddled with student loan debt.  I support this resolution overturning @BetsyDeVosED’s policy that hurts students. I’ll continue holding Secretary DeVos accountable. https://t.co/zvZR0HwWgj,2020-01-22 17:48:18,Twitter for iPhone,32,121
Taxpayers shouldn’t be on the hook for bonuses that go to contractors who fail to finish their projects on time or on budget. Proud to join the bipartisan Bogus Bonus Ban Act to crack down on wasteful spending &amp; ensure taxpayer money is used responsibly. https://t.co/941OqOd5nl,2020-01-22 15:36:36,Twitter for iPhone,16,82
In the 10 years since the Citizens United ruling we have seen unprecedented levels of money flood into our politics.  This must end. I’m proud to support the #ForThePeople Act that would get rid of big money in our politics &amp; give a greater voice to Michigan families.,2020-01-21 15:32:46,Twitter for iPhone,57,193

Grateful for the chance to address the @UrbanLgGR to discuss how Dr. King’s message of service unity faith and love still inspires us and charts a path for each of us to follow. https://t.co/G1DeuCeCsu,2020-01-20 21:21:29,Twitter for iPhone,10,61
As we celebrate the legacy of Dr. King it is only fitting that communities across the country will come together to honor his life’s work through a day of service.  Now more than ever it is critical that we reaffirm our commitment to the causes that defined his life. https://t.co/8FqlsiT3zc,2020-01-20 14:19:48,Twitter Web App,35,170
