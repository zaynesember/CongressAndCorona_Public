After closely reviewing the GOP police reform proposal it’s clear that it does not make the major systemic changes required to meet this moment &amp; I’ve decided to oppose it.

For 3 years President Trump’s #MuslimBan has sent the wrong message to our allies around the world about what we stand for as a country. We must pass the #NoBanAct now. #RepealTheBan https://t.co/fb9ura3PXR,2020-01-27 16:00:41,Twitter for iPhone,25,65
Speaking NOW in front of the Capitol to make it clear that President Trump’s #MuslimBan does not reflect our values as a nation. We must pass the #NoBanAct to #RepealTheBan. Watch our press conference LIVE: https://t.co/1zif8n1fWX,2020-01-27 15:40:03,Twitter for iPhone,23,73

Congressman @RepAdamSchiff wisely cautioned all Senators just last week that - eventually - the full truth about the President’s actions will come out. It’s our duty to ensure the truth comes out before the ongoing impeachment trial concludes.,2020-01-27 02:04:24,Twitter for iPhone,52,204
This report further underlines why my Republican colleagues should be working across the aisle to ensure we hear relevant testimony and receive documents from Ambassador Bolton along with Mick Mulvaney Robert Blair and Michael Duffey who should testify before the Senate.,2020-01-27 02:03:04,Twitter for iPhone,52,201
If the reported description of Ambassador Bolton’s upcoming book is accurate this account provides firsthand relevant evidence that President Trump committed the abuse of power for which he was impeached by the House. https://t.co/LdXXgVGcQq,2020-01-27 02:02:35,Twitter for iPhone,206,610

There’s so much going on but we shouldn’t forget that we only know about the depth and breadth of the President’s actions because of brave public servants – especially those at the State Dept – who have been willing to risk their careers to speak out against wrongdoing. https://t.co/9vhPG1Xmsf,2020-01-24 22:54:56,Twitter for iPhone,130,480

Senators who don’t ask for documents and witnesses that are clearly relevant to President Trump’s actions simply aren’t interested in the truth. https://t.co/GD2W6HlQtV,2020-01-24 21:12:14,Twitter for iPhone,274,950

In 2017 President Trump signed a tax bill that gave away hundreds of billions to corporations and added $2.3 trillion to the debt.   Yesterday he suggested he’ll cut Medicare and Social Security to dig out of his deficit hole.   That's unacceptable.   https://t.co/V42FmDHIoO,2020-01-23 22:28:43,TweetDeck,703,1223

Great to speak with you @SykesCharlie.   To those who are concerned about our Constitution our values and our place in the world I encourage you to listen to our conversation about why the Senate’s impeachment trial is so important.  @BulwarkOnline https://t.co/syUxkzMNE1,2020-01-23 18:35:07,TweetDeck,26,122
The United States is at its strongest when we are a welcoming country capable of attracting talented people from all over the world. The President’s current so-called Muslim travel ban is un-American. Expanding it further makes us less safe and violates our values. #NoBanAct,2020-01-23 18:14:42,Twitter Web App,13,42
I question whether @realDonaldTrump has thought through the harmful consequences of expanding this senseless #MuslimBan and I call on my colleagues to join me in pushing back against this action.,2020-01-23 18:14:42,Twitter Web App,13,41
Why would we make it more difficult to support the political transition in Sudan? Why would we make it harder for Kyrgyzstan to nurture its independence and democratic institutions?,2020-01-23 18:14:42,Twitter Web App,61,125
Banning people from Belarus Eritrea Kyrgyzstan Myanmar Nigeria Sudan &amp; Tanzania makes no strategic sense. Take Nigeria—it has the largest economy &amp; population in Africa. Nigerians represent the largest African diaspora group in the US. Why would we weaken our ties with them?,2020-01-23 18:14:42,Twitter Web App,13,18
Rather than expanding his discriminatory #MuslimBan that does not make us safer President Trump should lift the ban completely.,2020-01-23 18:14:41,Twitter Web App,18,51

Last night Senate Republicans spoke in a clear unified voice to say they don’t want to see any documents or hear from any witnesses.    History and the American people are watching. https://t.co/2rroNQcDtp,2020-01-22 20:56:34,Twitter Media Studio,89,342
“Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973. Two generations of young women have grown up understanding that they can control their own reproductive capacity and in fact their life’s destiny. We will never go back to the way it once was.”  - Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg  #RoevWade,2020-01-22 20:28:44,TweetDeck,65,168
I am committed to honoring and protecting the #RoevWade decision from the efforts to undermine and overturn it that we’re seeing across the country today.   This country will not go backwards.   #RoeMatters,2020-01-22 16:08:19,TweetDeck,18,61
Today though we’re seeing more and more right-wing efforts to undermine and overturn every woman’s constitutional right to safe legal abortion access.   We can’t let that happen. #RoeMatters,2020-01-22 16:07:02,TweetDeck,13,53
47 years ago #RoevWade became the law of the land.   Since then Roe has allowed women to plan their lives and families as they choose.   Women have been safer and more secure as a result. #RoeMatters,2020-01-22 16:05:24,TweetDeck,25,125
3 years ago President Trump’s #MuslimBan caused chaos nationwide &amp; led to the separation of thousands of families. Now he's expanding it.  This is unacceptable. We must pass the #NoBanAct to repeal this senseless policy &amp; ensure that a discriminatory ban never happens again. https://t.co/Q3xbKd1LtU,2020-01-22 14:06:50,Twitter Web App,51,116
I’m a lawyer and here’s what I know:  Trials have witnesses and the witnesses have to be relevant to the case. It isn’t complicated.

Just got off the Senate floor. Here’s a quick update on the first day of the impeachment trial: https://t.co/JtlCwbhCGJ,2020-01-22 01:15:13,Twitter for iPhone,137,458
It’s up to Congress to pass legislation to overturn this harmful decision and I’m ready to act. I’ll keep fighting for the American people’s voice in our elections. #EndCitizensUnited,2020-01-21 17:04:16,TweetDeck,16,74

His proposed rules would rush the presentation of the case erect barriers to witnesses &amp; even delay admission of evidence already in the record. I hope some of my GOP colleagues will see how unfair this proposal is &amp; vote with Democrats tomorrow to revise these unworkable rules.,2020-01-21 01:01:35,Twitter for iPhone,203,679
After repeatedly saying that we would get procedures just like the Clinton impeachment trial we now see that was false.  The proposal that Majority Leader McConnell just released looks more like a cover up than a fair trial. https://t.co/rg5BrXyDcO,2020-01-21 01:00:48,Twitter for iPhone,2024,4645
