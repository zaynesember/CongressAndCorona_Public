As I said on @NewDay Postmaster DeJoy isn't just jerking around voters he's upending our entire mail system.  It’s time for Mitch McConnell to bring back the Senate so we can do our jobs.

Yesterday was a historic moment for our country.

As I told @BretBaier on Fox News Donald Trump went before the country &amp; called @KamalaHarris "nasty." I think that’s crap.   As someone who knows @KamalaHarris I would use the words "tough" "grit" &amp; "strength" to describe her.  That's what our country wants in a VP. https://t.co/O2cc6biQDF,2020-08-12 01:23:02,Twitter Media Studio,2168,13646

Americans are struggling to get by—and instead of negotiating Donald Trump just walks away to go golfing.   Let’s get real.

85 days before one of the most important elections of our lifetime where millions will vote by mail to stay safe USPS sent a letter telling states to pay more to send ballots or risk further postal delays.

President Franklin D. Roosevelt once said “Courage is not the absence of fear but rather the assessment that something else is more important than fear.” These doctors are choosing service over fear.

When your job is to save lives you don’t say stupid stuff like this...unless you think your job is just to get attention. #V0TE   Trump asked if disinfectants could be injected to kill the coronavirus inside the body.

We have a President who said at the Republican Convention “I alone can fix this.” Then he took the backseat when it came to getting tests out.

Small businesses are facing an economy in turmoil &amp; need help. @ChrisCoonsforDE @BenCardinforMD &amp; I ensured in the relief package that small businesses with loans backed by SBA won't have to make payments for 6 months.

My number one concern is making sure Americans have access to #COVID_19 testing.   People need to know if they have the disease and officials need to know where and how it’s spreading.

Donald Trump's economy works well for his friends at Mar-a-Lago but making things more affordable should be the focus of a President.  He failed to bring pharma prices down.  He failed to make college more affordable.  He failed to invest in our infrastructure. #CNNTownHall,2020-02-27 02:35:36,Twitter Web App,421,1949
As President to take on coronavirus I would make sure we have adequate medical help and research ensure we have invested in education (because the next vaccine or cure is with a college student at your college) and keep the CDC strong. https://t.co/rtttw2A7XL #CNNTownHall,2020-02-27 02:21:48,Twitter Web App,157,687

When it comes to tax returns everyone up here has released their tax returns except Mayor Bloomberg.

When it comes to Medicare for All you don’t put your money on a number that’s not even on the wheel. And why is Medicare for All not on the wheel?

I keep listening to the same debate on Medicare for All but it’s not real. Two-thirds of Senate Democrats aren’t on the bill.

In Lt. Col. Vindman’s opening statement during the impeachment inquiry he spoke to his father—who fled the Soviet Union for the United States: “Do not worry.

It is a somber day for our country. As Senators we are representatives of the American people and it's our duty to protect and defend the Constitution.

As Michigan Governor @GretchenWhitmer said “You can listen to what someone says but to know the truth watch what they do."

In this election we must win and unite our party. We need a candidate who has a history of winning in red and purple districts who can bring along with her a fired-up Democratic base as well as Independents and moderate Republicans.  I have the receipts. I can get it done. https://t.co/HBfEQjSYnv,2020-01-27 13:01:49,Twitter Web App,455,2760

Heading back to impeachment hearing. This isn’t about what senators are eating or writing on. Want something “interesting?” Where are the witnesses? Where are the documents?
