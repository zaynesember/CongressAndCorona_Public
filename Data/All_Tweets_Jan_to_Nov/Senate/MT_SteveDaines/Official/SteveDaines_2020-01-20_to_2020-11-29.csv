I am voting to acquit @realDonaldTrump.    For the good of our country let it be seared in our minds forevermore: Impeachment must never again be used as a partisan weapon.

In the Senate @realDonaldTrump finally had the chance to present his argument and defend himself. And the President’s defense team shredded the incomplete case from the Democrats.
