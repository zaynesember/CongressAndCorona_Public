Trump's budget proposes $1 trillion in cuts to health care programs that benefit middle class and working families including Medicaid and the ACA.

Our nation is in a clean water crisis and yet Trump is determined to continue catering to polluters. Clean water is a human right period. https://t.co/NkVCEuR8ok,2020-01-28 22:52:09,Twitter Web App,1022,3370
Yesterday one of Trump's lawyers made a good point: cross-examination of witnesses brings out the truth.  That's exactly why the Senate must call John Bolton Mick Mulvaney Robert Blair and Michael Duffey as witnesses in Trump's trial. https://t.co/MEBxiwvPX5,2020-01-28 15:34:41,Twitter Media Studio,1610,6523
John Bolton needs to testify in Trump’s impeachment trial—period. https://t.co/4OJp020FqF,2020-01-28 03:29:05,Twitter Media Studio,1509,7744
John Bolton has direct evidence of Trump's misconduct. He must testify.  In courthouses across America every day people are confronted with direct evidence. Why should the president be treated any differently? He’s not above the law.,2020-01-27 23:22:42,Twitter Web App,4682,20896
A few things the White House did last week:  -confirmed plans for an expanded travel ban -announced travel restrictions on pregnant women seeking to travel to the U.S. -doubled down on deporting DACA recipients  This is what an anti-immigrant agenda looks like. We have to fight.,2020-01-27 15:17:52,Twitter Web App,1911,7113
Betsy DeVos should go back to school and take a history lesson. Comparing our country’s history of slavery to Republicans trying to strip away reproductive rights from women is shameful. She should recant these comments immediately. https://t.co/gq9QiedTLn,2020-01-27 14:03:24,Twitter Web App,1915,8947
Last month I wrote in @nytimes that we need to hear from John Bolton—who shopped his testimony to book publishers instead of speaking with Congress—because he clearly has a lot to say.  It's undeniable now: Bolton must testify in Trump’s trial. https://t.co/zBnkCNpOP3,2020-01-27 00:41:43,Twitter for iPhone,2125,7821
Devastating news for Los Angeles and the entire country. Kobe Bryant's impact on basketball and sports was unquestionable. He will remain an inspiration to many for years to come. My heart goes out to his family and loved ones. https://t.co/ue4rxUVwcV,2020-01-26 21:02:53,Twitter Web App,1759,17754
Trump's impeachment trial comes down to this: he put his personal and political agenda ahead of the interest of the American people ahead of the interest of our national security and ahead of the interest of doing the job of the President of the United States.,2020-01-26 17:01:53,Twitter for iPhone,2697,12030

Today made it clear that President Trump’s defense counsel don’t think they have a case on the merits—so they’re relying on misleading statements and distorted facts.,2020-01-25 19:36:45,Twitter Web App,4725,21858

The seriousness of this moment cannot be lost on anyone. The House managers have done an extraordinary job this week and we must stay focused on our duty as senators to seek the truth.  Because in America nobody is above the law—including the President of the United States.,2020-01-25 03:00:27,Twitter Web App,1425,8486
.@SecPompeo allowed Ambassador Yovanovitch to be smeared and targeted while she was representing our country abroad. He hardly “defended every single person” on his team. This is a disgrace.  https://t.co/94Hk6ohWKL,2020-01-25 00:35:35,Twitter for iPhone,3864,11119
Important point made by @RepSylviaGarcia: Trump has submitted 0 documents in response to over 70 requests and 5 subpoenas. He directed his officials not to comply with lawful subpoenas to testify before Congress. This is complete stonewalling. https://t.co/YqjiQO1vCu,2020-01-24 23:54:57,Twitter for iPhone,1845,5882
Trump’s impeachment trial isn’t a television show. It’s not for entertainment. If this process is going to have any legitimacy it is because it has focused on facts. https://t.co/2d8qFGNABL,2020-01-24 17:54:28,Twitter Media Studio,889,3945
Always great to catch up with some dear friends and mayors from California. Our mayors are at the forefront of every issue we’re working on in DC—and I know these three are fierce leaders for their communities. https://t.co/v4hqgzc7Lm,2020-01-24 16:07:58,Twitter Web App,109,808

The House managers have done an extraordinary job of showing us the math and laying out the facts. If my Republican colleagues were speaking with any level of sincerity they would agree.,2020-01-24 03:34:53,Twitter for iPad,1889,12601
Let's not be distracted by whatever is happening on the sidelines of Trump’s impeachment trial. We need to focus on the facts and seek truth. https://t.co/2mHimPn5eb,2020-01-24 00:16:35,Twitter Media Studio,1261,5933
Let's be clear about something. On Tuesday every single Republican senator voted to block access to firsthand witnesses and relevant documents.  And now they have to gall to say that so far in the trial they haven't learned anything new.  They can’t have it both ways.,2020-01-23 20:01:13,Twitter Web App,12592,47862
The issue before us: Trump tried to solicit foreign interference in our election got caught and is trying to cover it up. https://t.co/ItaEuWb0T0,2020-01-23 17:31:23,Twitter Media Studio,1684,5892
A disgraceful comment from the commander in chief. Downplaying the invisible wounds of war inflicted on our service members is a slap in their face. If Trump can’t see that then how can he care for them? https://t.co/NECM7f8EdY,2020-01-23 14:47:45,Twitter Web App,2684,9731
Today the House managers laid out the case against Trump the same way I would have—by showing the math. And the math shows Trump tried to solicit foreign interference in our elections got caught and is trying to cover it up. https://t.co/uG1mlAtWE5,2020-01-23 02:45:21,Twitter Media Studio,1652,7412
It's simple:  -Zelensky told Trump he needed military aid -Then Trump said “I would like you to do us a favor though.” -That same day Michael Duffey sent an email directing military aid to be withheld  Now the White House is withholding Duffey's emails. This is a cover-up.,2020-01-23 00:21:02,Twitter for iPhone,12332,42564

47 years ago today the Supreme Court recognized a woman’s right to choose in Roe v. Wade. To this day Republicans are determined to turn back the clock to when women were dying from unsafe abortions. But we won’t let them—we must keep up the fight for reproductive justice.,2020-01-22 16:55:09,Twitter Web App,1613,7632
There is no denying that voter suppression is real in America. There are Republican efforts across the country to deny people of color their fundamental right to vote. This threatens the very heart of our democracy and we have to fight. https://t.co/sFyEKhyn3M,2020-01-22 14:14:01,Twitter Web App,918,2683
Final thought tonight: every single Republican senator voted to block every single amendment for relevant evidence and firsthand witnesses. Let that sink in.  The American people deserve better than this. We need a fair trial. Not a cover-up.,2020-01-22 06:54:13,Twitter for iPhone,21143,81999
Republicans shot down amendments that would allow senators to access relevant evidence withheld by the White House State Department and OMB.  We're witnessing an effort to obstruct senators' ability to actually know what happened—this is shameful. https://t.co/oVezqVq7hy,2020-01-22 00:34:48,Twitter Media Studio,7475,23492
On break right now and let me just say this: I fully support Senator Schumer’s amendment to ensure we see all relevant documents withheld by the White House. Documents don’t lie.  If Republicans block this then it’s not a fair trial. Period.,2020-01-21 19:56:36,Twitter Web App,9645,45806

We need to hear from Mick Mulvaney. We need to hear from John Bolton.

It’s clear McConnell and Trump want to ignore sworn evidence. And they don’t want firsthand witnesses to Trump’s misconduct.  But the American people want a fair trial and they will hold every senator accountable for their votes tomorrow. https://t.co/qKU96Le6zm,2020-01-21 00:30:07,Twitter for iPhone,3903,12754
