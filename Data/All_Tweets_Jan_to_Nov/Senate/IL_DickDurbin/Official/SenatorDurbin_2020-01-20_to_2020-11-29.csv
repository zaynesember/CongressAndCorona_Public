In a 4-4 vote #SCOTUS rejected a Republican effort to stop the Penn. Supreme Court’s decision extending the state’s absentee ballot deadline. This is a victory for democracy.

Republicans are rushing forward with their plan to confirm Judge Barrett before Election Day. They want a right-wing 6-3 Supreme Court majority to end the Affordable Care Act overturn Roe v.

The Community Reinvestment Act was enacted to facilitate investment in marginalized communities after decades of redlining &amp; discriminatory lending practices.

Alexey Navalny has demonstrated immense courage fighting for democracy in Russia. President Trump's refusal to condemn Putin for poisoning a key political rival shows just how deferential he is to the former KGB agent. https://t.co/r18eS1Gp0l,2020-10-19 19:40:28,Twitter Web App,90,280
The Affordable Care Act provides protections for more than 100 million Americans with pre-existing conditions. That includes cancer diabetes heart disease asthma depression &amp; COVID-19.   We can’t let Republicans take those protections away.,2020-10-19 16:59:24,Twitter Web App,163,538
Judge Barrett was a constitutional law professor—she knows all about the explicit language in our Constitution regarding the peaceful transfer of power after an election.

A 6-3 right-wing Supreme Court is a threat to health care to a woman’s right to choose and to the right of Americans to love who they love.

More than 100M Americans with pre-existing conditions like Kenny Murray of Tinley Park rely on the Affordable Care Act’s protections. On November 10 Pres.

Pres. Trump was clear: he wants Supreme Court justices who will help him end the Affordable Care Act. Judge Barrett’s hearing did not reassure us that the law is safe.

Judge Barrett’s originalism gives me no comfort.

80% of Black moms are the breadwinners in their home meaning they can’t afford to get sick or stay home during this pandemic. That’s one of the many reasons why we must expand paid leave in the next round of #COVID19 relief.,2020-08-13 18:01:39,Twitter Web App,28,89
#BlackWomensEqualPayDay is a reminder that we still haven’t achieved #PaycheckFairness and closed the wage gap especially for women of color. I’m proud to cosponsor the Paycheck Fairness Act and will keep fighting to achieve equal pay for all. https://t.co/D9Ptp0FHf5,2020-08-13 18:01:39,Twitter Web App,48,121
The Census is far too important to rush to completion which is exactly what the Trump Administration is trying to do. I’m joining a bipartisan group of 48 Senators in calling for Congressional leadership to extend the statutory deadline for the Census. https://t.co/o6LGfe7X0T,2020-08-13 16:13:16,Twitter Web App,48,153
“They don’t have the money to do the universal mail-in voting. So therefore they can’t do it I guess” says the one person holding up funding for @USPS.   We can't let the President get away with this. We must fund the Postal Service. https://t.co/V9EaICKqoT,2020-08-13 15:01:56,Twitter Web App,341,794
Nearly 8M student borrowers weren't eligible for CARES Act student loan relief &amp; won't benefit from the President's executive order.

Another blatant attempt to silence opposition voices and undermine Hong Kong's democracy and rule of law. Sadly we continue to see more democratic backsliding around the world under President Trump and Sec. Pompeo. https://t.co/wKj7YBeLdD,2020-08-12 22:05:04,Twitter Web App,103,195
We also need to fully fund @USPS so that essential services can continue like delivering medicines and mail-in ballots during a pandemic when people are trying to limit their exposure.,2020-08-12 20:50:52,Twitter Web App,54,270
Today in Springfield I urged the Postmaster General to take corrective action against recent operational changes including the elimination of overtime and a reduction in mail sorting and processing hours that has led to significant delays in the delivery of mail to Illinoisans. https://t.co/L5DCmHgqFE,2020-08-12 20:50:50,Twitter Web App,127,433

What a sad indictment of Sen. McConnell’s priorities. Families across the US are struggling to pay rent &amp; put food on the table &amp; the Senate Majority Leader is focused on shielding corporations from accountability. This is Washington at its worst. https://t.co/VH9qRaGrBn,2020-08-12 17:07:59,Twitter Web App,854,1562
The President’s executive order on unemployment benefits was a cheap political stunt. The only realistic way to extend these benefits is by passing comprehensive #COVID19 relief through Congress which @SenateGOP have been blocking since May. https://t.co/i7TtEGGDe1,2020-08-12 15:57:04,Twitter Web App,150,333
We can’t let Pres. Trump dismantle @USPS in the run up to an election where mail-in ballots will be vital to ensuring Americans of all political persuasions can safely exercise their right to vote.

Struggling state governments can’t afford to shoulder the burden for enhanced unemployment benefits.

The President’s plan for extending enhanced unemployment places too much burden on state gov'ts. The White House &amp; Republicans need to get back to the negotiating table so that Congress can pass a realistic &amp; comprehensive plan for #COVID19 relief.  https://t.co/vQCwAcMr7A,2020-08-10 19:01:45,Twitter Web App,52,155

Senator McConnell’s plan for liability immunity is a massive corporate giveaway that will do nothing to make Americans safer or help reduce the spread of #COVID19. No wonder Senate Republicans kept it secret for so long. https://t.co/vv8weHAKbE,2020-08-10 17:11:33,Twitter Web App,212,375

The President’s country club executive order amounts to a $200 cut in unemployment benefits &amp; will strain already stressed state gov't budgets. Instead White House &amp; Republicans should come back to the negotiating table &amp; work with Dems on a plan for #COVID19 relief. https://t.co/82eiR5Kun0,2020-08-09 18:14:02,Twitter Web App,87,284

The Republican police reform bill fails to meet the moment. Republicans &amp; Democrats should work in good faith to reach a bipartisan agreement.

For the 2nd week in a row the Senate is voting on a Circuit Court nominee who has been openly hostile toward the Affordable Care Act.

My bipartisan bicameral bill w/ @BillPascrell &amp; @RepRoKhanna would protect American workers and end the abuse of the H-1B program while ensuring employers could still hire talented immigrant workers when no qualified American is available to do the job.,2020-06-23 01:10:05,Twitter Web App,30,165
This is not the right approach. We need to mend the H-1B program not end it. Instead of suspending H-1B visas the Trump Admin should ask Congress to pass the H-1B and L-1 Visa Reform Act of 2020 which reforms the H-1B program with a scalpel not a sledgehammer. https://t.co/fYp1FOM879,2020-06-23 01:10:05,Twitter Web App,119,409

Jesus is not alone — 41700 #DACA recipients are essential health care workers on the frontlines of the #COVID19 pandemic. Pres. Trump must act to save #DACA and the Senate must step up &amp; provide #Dreamers with a path to citizenship by passing the Dream &amp; Promise Act. https://t.co/ZgX3tAGiTD,2020-06-19 17:37:00,Twitter Web App,33,126

Congress also has a responsibility to step in. It's been more than a year since the House passed the bipartisan American Dream &amp; Promise Act which would give #Dreamers a path to citizenship. Senate Majority Leader McConnell must let the Senate vote on this bill now as well.,2020-06-18 22:14:45,Twitter Web App,14,71
President Trump should change course and protect #DACA recipients by:   1. Publicly announcing that he will not make another attempt to repeal DACA; and   2. Directing DHS to reopen DACA to eligible individuals who have been unable to apply due to his decision to terminate DACA.,2020-06-18 22:14:44,Twitter Web App,6,25
More than 200000 #Dreamers—including 41700 health care workers—are on the frontlines of the #COVID19 pandemic.  Now that #SCOTUS has rejected Pres.

The U.S. has more prisoners by far than any other country in the world. And prisons - where social distancing is impossible - are especially vulnerable to this pandemic. It’s a recipe for disaster. https://t.co/R3u7LqfK9E,2020-04-26 19:20:41,Twitter Web App,54,188

During a pandemic we must protect the health &amp; safety of every individual including those living &amp; working in the tight quarters of prisons. I have serious concerns that BOP is not taking enough preventative measures to adequately protect BOP staff &amp; inmates from #COVID19.,2020-04-25 19:35:08,Twitter Web App,37,203
Sorry Dr. Birx. We saw the look on your face. What the President said was not a joke a question sarcasm or as you said on FOX the way he thinks out loud.

The President is threatening to invoke executive privilege. But as House managers explained he hasn’t. Why? He’d have to identify which docs/communications he wants to protect. So instead he’s claiming “absolute immunity“ which courts reject.,2020-01-30 04:15:04,Twitter for iPhone,77,309
My question for House managers:  If President Trump were to actually invoke executive privilege wouldn’t he be required to identify the specific documents or communications containing sensitive material that he seeks to protect? https://t.co/oLtMoijMMZ,2020-01-30 04:15:04,Twitter for iPhone,87,287
In the first day of questioning by Senators House managers &amp; the President's lawyers debated the meaning of Bolton’s and Mulvaney’s statements &amp; conflicting accounts of WH meetings.

Pres. Trump’s agenda is clear: get #SCOTUS to uphold illegal repeal of #DACA so he can deport young immigrants who grew up in this country.

The cruelty is the point. https://t.co/NDD2MpPKTr,2020-01-28 19:45:19,Twitter Web App,227,368
There’s a reason the President’s defense team hates the notion of allowing witnesses documents and evidence to be brought in this trial and before the American people.

The only way for the Senate to hold a trial that will be credible across America is to call in witnesses like John Bolton. I don’t know what Amb. Bolton will say under oath—no one does.

It is obvious that this travel ban was driven by anti-Muslim animus on the part of the President &amp; his enablers. It has ripped thousands of families apart.
