Dr. Fauci responded: Not at all. https://t.co/vueWovqw9X,2020-09-23 19:13:55,Twitter Media Studio,18,50
Until vaccines and treatments are widely distributed the explosion of many cheap reliable rapid diagnostic tests is our best weapon to build confidence among the American people that it is safe to go back to school college back to child care and back to work.,2020-09-23 14:16:47,Twitter for iPhone,3,10

.@AbbottNews says that it is on track to produce 50M of its new tests a month by October which can produce a result in 15 minutes and costs $5 per test. The government has purchased 150 million of Abbott’s tests to help expand testing in places like schools and nursing homes.,2020-09-23 14:16:46,Twitter for iPhone,2,2

Today I introduced the Student Loan Repayment and FAFSA Simplification Act — legislation that will streamline the nine current ways to repay a federal student loan into two straightforward options and reduce the #FAFSA to less than three dozen questions. https://t.co/TuBo9Q4ISD,2020-07-22 00:34:00,Twitter Media Studio,13,63
Number Two: When you do begin earning income your monthly payment will never be more than 10 percent of your income after you deduct the necessities of life such as the cost of housing—such as rent or mortgage—and food.,2020-07-21 22:45:17,Twitter Web App,3,29
I propose that we say this:   Number One: No Income: No monthly payment. In other words if you have a student loan your monthly payment is zero if you do not have any income for whatever reason.,2020-07-21 22:45:17,Twitter Web App,3,28
In March Congress deferred student loan payments for six months but without congressional action payments will resume starting October 1.   October 1 is just around the corner.   What do we say to those 43 million student loan borrowers today?,2020-07-21 22:45:16,Twitter Web App,20,67

COVID-19 is a science matter not a political matter.   But it has become too much of a political matter.

Because of this 10 years of telehealth experience crammed into 3 months—patients doctors nurses therapists and caregivers can write some new rules of the road and we should do so while the experiences still are fresh on our minds.,2020-06-17 14:12:02,Twitter Web App,3,7

Our founding documents provide for duly elected presidents who serve with “the consent of the governed” not at the pleasure of the United States Congress.   Let the people decide.   15/15,2020-01-31 04:00:15,Twitter Web App,3197,11532
It would create the weapon of perpetual impeachment to be used against future presidents whenever the House of Representatives is of a different political party. 14/15,2020-01-31 04:00:14,Twitter Web App,1089,5490
If this shallow hurried and wholly partisan impeachment were to succeed it would rip the country apart pouring gasoline on the fire of cultural divisions that already exist. 13/15,2020-01-31 04:00:14,Twitter Web App,1452,6543
The framers believed that there should never ever be a partisan impeachment. That is why the Constitution requires a 2/3 vote of the Senate for conviction. Yet not one House Republican voted for these articles. 12/15,2020-01-31 04:00:14,Twitter Web App,1338,6192
Even if the House charges were true they do not meet the Constitution’s “treason bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors” standard for an impeachable offense. 11/15,2020-01-31 04:00:13,Twitter Web App,1177,5213
The Senate has spent nine long days considering this “mountain” of evidence the arguments of the House managers and the president’s lawyers their answers to senators’ questions and the House record. 10/15,2020-01-31 04:00:12,Twitter Web App,425,2479
I believe that the Constitution provides that the people should make that decision in the presidential election that begins in Iowa on Monday. 9/15,2020-01-31 04:00:12,Twitter Web App,637,3535
The question then is not whether the president did it but whether the United States Senate or the American people should decide what to do about what he did. 8/15,2020-01-31 04:00:12,Twitter Web App,609,2774
But the Constitution does not give the Senate the power to remove the president from office and ban him from this year’s ballot simply for actions that are inappropriate. 7/15,2020-01-31 04:00:11,Twitter Web App,785,3907
When elected officials inappropriately interfere with such investigations it undermines the principle of equal justice under the law. 6/15,2020-01-31 04:00:10,Twitter Web App,650,2868
It was inappropriate for the president to ask a foreign leader to investigate his political opponent and to withhold United States aid to encourage that investigation. 5/15,2020-01-31 04:00:10,Twitter Web App,961,3418
There is no need to consider further the frivolous second article of impeachment that would remove the president for asserting his constitutional prerogative to protect confidential conversations with his close advisers. 4/15,2020-01-31 04:00:09,Twitter Web App,863,4490
There is no need for more evidence to conclude that the president withheld United States aid at least in part to pressure Ukraine to investigate the Bidens; the House managers have proved this with what they call a “mountain of overwhelming evidence.” 3/15,2020-01-31 04:00:08,Twitter Web App,1341,4644
There is no need for more evidence to prove that the president asked Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter; he said this on television on October 3 2019 and during his July 25 2019 telephone call with the president of Ukraine. 2/15,2020-01-31 04:00:08,Twitter Web App,1093,4787
I worked with other senators to make sure that we have the right to ask for more documents and witnesses but there is no need for more evidence to prove something that has already been proven and that does not meet the U.S. Constitution’s high bar for an impeachable offense.1/15,2020-01-31 04:00:07,Twitter Web App,12024,47049
