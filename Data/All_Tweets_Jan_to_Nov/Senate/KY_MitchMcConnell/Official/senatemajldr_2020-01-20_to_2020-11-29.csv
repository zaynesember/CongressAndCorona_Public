Our country badly needs the kinds of targeted urgent COVID relief that Republicans have been trying to pass for months — from job-saving PPP funding to vaccine distribution.   My full statement: https://t.co/ybJ2OJSYf9,2020-11-20 20:20:48,Twitter for iPhone,713,4123
For months Republicans have tried to make bipartisan progress on huge areas of COVID relief where there's no disagreement.  Vaccine distribution funds.  Another round of the PPP for hard-hit small businesses.   But Democrats blocked it all over their unrelated liberal wish-list.,2020-11-18 21:10:29,Twitter Web App,4653,16244
.@ChuckGrassley had not missed a single vote in 27 years. Yesterday he paused that streak on doctors’ orders while awaiting a COVID test result.    The Senate is praying for continued good health for our president pro tempore and looking forward to seeing him again soon.,2020-11-18 17:23:30,Twitter Web App,1279,10820
Republicans have tried for weeks to pass another targeted rescue package. It would send hundreds of billions of dollars to schools unemployment aid another round of the job-saving PPP and healthcare.   Democrats repeatedly blocked it all. Let's hope they let us make law soon.,2020-11-18 00:36:41,Twitter for iPhone,4681,19615
Another Democrat demand that’s blocked bipartisan aid: The fixation on a massive slush fund for state &amp; city govt's unlinked from COVID need.  Some states are taking in more tax revenue this fall than they did before the pandemic.   It's struggling families who need urgent help.,2020-11-17 19:48:31,Twitter Web App,2645,10143
House Democrats’ so-called “HEROES Act” is so unserious that it was condemned by the Speaker's own moderate Democrats the instant she put it out.   Huge tax cuts for rich people in blue states but no second round of the Paycheck Protection Program? Those are their priorities?,2020-11-17 17:47:39,Twitter for iPhone,7722,22646
Months ago skeptics dismissed President Trump’s aggressive timelines for vaccines. But our scientists are making history with a huge assist from Operation Warp Speed. It's sped up research &amp; laid groundwork for fast distribution once a vaccine is confirmed safe and effective.,2020-11-16 23:21:18,Twitter Web App,6260,32435
More huge news this morning in COVID-19 vaccine development. The kinds of headlines we've longed for.  But we must stay careful for the next weeks and months. Wear our masks. Keep social distance. We've come this far and victory is in sight. Let's not surrender to the virus now.,2020-11-16 22:46:19,Twitter Web App,805,6116
The Trump Administration has made huge strides in the Middle East: taking out terrorist leaders brokering historic deals &amp; moving US forces into support roles as Afghans lead the fight for their country.  Premature retreat would put this record at risk. https://t.co/egVaLJSIlS,2020-11-16 21:39:54,Twitter for iPhone,611,3164
It is sad to see leading Democrats including some Governors treat the vaccine news like a mixed blessing because it occurred under a Republican administration. Some things must be bigger than politics.  Leaders should be cheering this on not baselessly undermining science.,2020-11-12 21:14:55,Twitter Web App,12735,69754
This week’s news on a COVID-19 vaccine was incredibly promising. All of us have to keep up commonsense precautions in the meantime. The virus is spreading quickly in Kentucky and nationwide and it doesn’t care whether we’ve gotten bored with wearing masks or social distancing.,2020-11-12 17:30:40,Twitter Web App,872,7387
Today we reflect on the heroism of America’s veterans and those currently serving in uniform.

This news confirms what Republicans have said for months:  Our country needs more smart focused relief that is targeted to schools healthcare small businesses &amp; those who are hurting the most.  Not the absurd multi-trillion-dollar socialist wish-lists Democrats have demanded.,2020-11-10 20:30:45,Twitter Web App,837,5221
American workers are rebuilding our economy stronger &amp; faster than anyone predicted.   Experts predicted double-digit unemployment into 2021. Instead it’s down to 6.9%. More than 630k new jobs just last month.   Too many are still hurting. Our work isn't done. But what progress.,2020-11-10 20:30:45,Twitter Web App,1322,7721
Grateful to my Senate Republican colleagues for their unanimous confidence in me to continue serving as Leader. We have a lot more to do to continue fighting for working families and strengthening our great country. https://t.co/Vh8yNkC3Pl,2020-11-10 17:52:29,Twitter Web App,2878,19372

Here’s how this must work in our great country: Every legal vote should be counted. Any illegally-submitted ballots must not. All sides must get to observe the process.

The Senate just confirmed Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court of the United States.  One of the most impressive nominees for public office in a generation will serve for life on our highest court. https://t.co/qkJ0FPbTv1,2020-10-27 00:06:31,Twitter Media Studio,11166,53117
The Senate just voted to advance one of the most qualified nominees in generations. Judge Barrett’s intellectual brilliance integrity and commitment to impartiality are above reproach.   Tomorrow we will vote to confirm the next Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.,2020-10-25 18:12:19,Twitter Web App,11081,53963
More coronavirus resources are on the way to Kentucky. With the help of @HHSGov &amp; @usedgov Kentucky students &amp; teachers will receive more than two million masks.

Democrats cannot use “illegitimate” as a synonym for “we didn’t get our way.”  Democrats keep demanding the President repeat that the election will be valid even if he dislikes the outcome. But they're flunking that test badly with Judge Barrett's nomination. https://t.co/Lvf0DtlA6Y,2020-10-24 17:32:53,Twitter Media Studio,3335,11047
For the third time this year the Trump administration’s efforts have guided an historic step forward in the Middle East. Yesterday’s announcement of normalized relations between Israel and Sudan is good news for peace-loving people everywhere.,2020-10-24 13:10:58,Twitter for iPhone,4682,19971
With no good arguments to stop Judge Barrett Democrats have resorted to blatant falsehoods. Inventing fake Lincoln quotes. Lying about this moving faster than many past confirmations.  Facts not falsehoods are going to carry the day in the Senate. https://t.co/pxAeYmkfn6,2020-10-22 20:52:04,Twitter Web App,905,3811
Tune in now: I’m joining @DanaPerino on @FoxNews to discuss Judge Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination to the Supreme Court and Democrats’ continued blockade of COVID-19 relief for struggling Americans.,2020-10-22 18:34:33,Twitter for iPhone,689,3864
This morning the Judiciary Committee reported Judge Barrett’s nomination to the Senate floor. Their unanimous recommendation was that she be confirmed.   This nomination will receive an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor in the next several days.,2020-10-22 17:56:39,Twitter Web App,3681,17761
Our Constitution forbids disqualifying people from public service due to their religious beliefs. The far left has either forgotten this or just doesn’t care. It only underscores why we need well-informed jurists like Judge Barrett to protect our Constitution &amp; Americans’ rights. https://t.co/9iCPWs3V7P,2020-10-21 20:09:28,Twitter for iPhone,2933,8751
Senate Democrats just used the filibuster — which they say they dislike — to kill another coronavirus relief package.   Unemployment benefits. PPP. Testing. Vaccines. School funding. Protections for people with pre-existing conditions.   Every Democrat just voted to block it all.,2020-10-21 17:53:49,Twitter Web App,12411,18555
NOW: The Senate is voting on another rescue package for American families.  Testing. Treatments. Vaccines. Unemployment aid. Another PPP. Historic money for schools. Find common ground &amp; get help out the door.  We'll see if Democrats use the filibuster to kill the bill.,2020-10-21 17:00:32,Twitter Web App,1736,5437
Democrats have said we shouldn’t pass any more relief at all unless Speaker Pelosi gets her whole far-left wish list including all kinds of non-COVID-related demands.   Working families in Kentucky and around the country deserve better than this obstruction.,2020-10-21 16:54:58,Twitter Web App,7157,19428
The Paycheck Protection Program has made a critical difference for millions of working families. Today I’m having the Senate vote on a new second round for the hardest-hit small businesses.   Democrats say they support the PPP. Let’s see how they vote.,2020-10-20 20:18:40,Twitter Web App,3724,11689
Democrats have delayed aid for months over non-COVID-related liberal demands. Last night Leader Schumer even tried to adjourn the Senate for three weeks. Americans need help; Democrats just want to go home.   We are voting on more aid this week.,2020-10-20 17:15:57,Twitter Web App,12249,31421
Speaker Pelosi’s all-or-nothing act has kept Americans waiting for months. We badly need Congress to agree where we can get money out the door now and keep arguing over the Speaker’s non-COVID-related wish list later.  We'll vote on hundreds of billions in more aid this week.,2020-10-20 00:00:11,Twitter for iPhone,6120,16560
Last week Judge Barrett proved she has the deep legal expertise judicial temperament and intellectual horsepower that Americans deserve to have on the Supreme Court. The Senate will turn to her nomination as soon as it comes out of committee later this week.,2020-10-19 22:07:53,Twitter Web App,7870,29059
I just announced the Senate will vote next week on hundreds of billions more dollars for relief programs that Democrats do not even oppose.

Judge Barrett exhibited every bit of the intellectual brilliance legal expertise and open-minded judicial temperament that we need on the Supreme Court. I will proudly vote to confirm her. The Senate will take up her nomination as soon as it comes out of Committee. https://t.co/KkOGo0JVKL,2020-10-16 17:02:16,Twitter for iPhone,3158,10896
It is bizarre to watch Vice President Biden and Democrats refuse to give a straight answer on their own party’s threats to pack the Supreme Court. But it is even more absurd for them to try to redefine “court-packing” to mean any judicial confirmation that disappoints Democrats. https://t.co/RpZbaXNO2m,2020-10-14 18:47:23,Twitter for iPhone,3368,9580
We don’t agree with Speaker Pelosi that “nothing” is better than “something” for workers.  Senators will vote on more relief next week including more PPP money to stop layoffs. We’ll be able to pass it before we turn to Judge Barrett's nomination unless Democrats block it again. https://t.co/paJFhx5HcI,2020-10-13 16:22:27,Twitter for iPhone,1030,2414
Judge Barrett is just as brilliant and impressive as advertised. She is clearly qualified. She’s committed to fairness and impartiality. And she clearly understands the job of a judge under the Constitution is to apply the law and not impose personal policy views.,2020-10-13 16:10:48,Twitter Web App,13627,60179
The far left has been threatening our basic institutions of government since long before this Supreme Court vacancy.

The ongoing attacks by Senate Democrats and the media on Judge Barrett’s faith are a disgrace. They demean the confirmation process disrespect the Constitution and insult millions of American believers. https://t.co/Qg5mFQzWFO,2020-10-07 12:06:47,Twitter for iPhone,8732,25399
President Trump made an outstanding choice in Judge Amy Coney Barrett. She is one of the finest legal minds of her generation. She’s won national admiration for her example of strong female leadership. She’s exactly the kind of person Americans deserve on their highest Court. https://t.co/eYEle2s1nw,2020-10-06 15:28:32,Twitter Media Studio,4247,15189
Judge Barrett’s hearings will begin one week from today. Chairman Graham has all the tools to conduct a hybrid hearing just like the 150 others the Senate has held this year.   We will not stop working for the American people because Democrats are afraid they may lose a vote.,2020-10-06 00:30:36,Twitter for iPhone,14967,53514
Democrats say they’ll try everything to stall Judge Barrett. The latest excuse: Hybrid hearings with some virtual participation are suddenly bad.   The Senate has held 150 of these hybrid hearings since May. Democrats have taken advantage of the tools. They’ve praised the format.,2020-10-05 22:41:51,Twitter for iPhone,10447,30675

Everyone who knows Judge Barrett across the political spectrum praises her independence and impartiality.  A judge's job is to follow the facts and the law wherever they lead. Nothing more nothing less.  It's revealing how much this basic concept seems to scare the far left.,2020-09-30 22:17:55,Twitter Web App,2252,7490
Democrats want to pack the Supreme Court. Vice President Biden refused to rule it out last night. Now Senate Democrats are demanding promises and pre-commitments from Judge Barrett.   Judicial independence is vital to the rule of law. Why are Republicans alone in defending it?,2020-09-30 19:47:53,Twitter for iPhone,5246,14975
Judge Barrett is an exemplary judge and a qualified nominee for the Supreme Court. Her legal peers across the political spectrum praise her independence fair-mindedness and impartiality.

Even Speaker Pelosi’s own House Democrats are sick of her blocking COVID-19 relief.  But she insists anything short of her multi-trillion wish list would make Democrats “a cheap date.” What a joke.

Every Senator who voted against relief needs to answer what in the proposal they actually disagreed with. Kids? Jobs? Healthcare? https://t.co/iuGc7fN01A,2020-09-10 22:36:30,Twitter Media Studio,557,1313
Every Senate Democrat just voted against hundreds of billions of dollars of COVID-19 relief. They blocked money for schools testing vaccines unemployment insurance and the Paycheck Protection Program.  Their goal is clear: No help for American families before the election.,2020-09-10 17:21:10,Twitter Web App,19867,35914
Yesterday reporters asked Sen. Schumer whether by refusing to compromise he was making the perfect the enemy of the good. His response? “Republicans are the enemy of the good.”  Americans are not enemies. COVID-19 is our enemy. It's time for Washington Democrats to act like it.,2020-09-10 17:00:05,Twitter Web App,5445,14436
The Senate is voting today on COVID-19 relief. Hundreds of billions more dollars to make schools safe for kids to keep workers getting paid and to invest in treatments and vaccines.  American families will see exactly which Senators want to send them more bipartisan help.,2020-09-10 15:21:35,Twitter Web App,1516,4376
Speaker Pelosi &amp; Leader Schumer were attacking our new COVID proposal before they’d even read it.  They’re attacking it over provisions that literally have Democrat cosponsors.  They just don't want Americans getting another cent of bipartisan relief before the November election.,2020-09-09 23:24:09,Twitter for iPhone,4980,11145
The coronavirus doesn't care about our election. But it's clear that's all Democrats care about. Look at the facts and ask each Democrat what in the proposal that we're voting on tomorrow they actually disagree with.   More historic funding for schools? Jobs? Healthcare? https://t.co/p38BQjgvKM,2020-09-09 20:26:41,Twitter Media Studio,1299,3321

Republicans have built yet another effort to help Americans. Money for schools. Resources for parents. Testing. Vaccines. Another round of the job-saving PPP. And more.  The Senate will be voting this week. The nation will see who's serious about making law for American families.,2020-09-09 01:16:41,Twitter for iPhone,1785,5653
Democrats have blocked any new COVID relief saying anything short of their entire far-left wish list is “piecemeal” and “emaciated.”   The same Democrats rushed back to D.C. to pass piecemeal legislation for the Postal Service that did nothing at all for working families.,2020-09-08 23:46:04,Twitter for iPhone,3553,6761
Republicans have spent months fighting for more COVID-19 relief. We proposed a major $1T bill. Speaker Pelosi &amp; Leader Schumer said no. We suggested smaller bipartisan deals. They said no again.   Today we put forward yet another proposal. They attacked it before even reading it.,2020-09-08 22:20:38,Twitter Web App,6341,13764
Republicans and Democrats have big differences but they should not stop us from agreeing where we can and making law to help Americans through this crisis.

Democrats’ latest spin: They’ve moved from a $3.5 trillion far-left non-COVID-related wish list to a $2.5 trillion far-left non-COVID-related wish list and insist the White House meet them there.

Democrats say they disagree with parts of @SenatorTimScott’s bill. Fine. The Senate has a way to settle policy differences. It’s called legislating. The only reason to duck the whole process is if Democrats would rather preserve a campaign issue than find a bipartisan solution.,2020-06-24 17:00:10,Twitter Web App,2499,7130
Democrats just blocked the Senate from even considering police reform.

Sadly Democrats began attacking the JUSTICE Act proposal before it was even released.   The Senate has recently put division aside to produce major bipartisan bills like the CARES Act and the Great American Outdoors Act. Police reform needs that same spirit.

More than two-thirds of independent business owners say they are worried about a legal liability minefield getting in the way of re-opening.

Even though the Democrats’ own top member on the Intelligence Committee praises this nominee and wants a swift confirmation Senate Democrats still forced us to use hours of floor time and multiple votes as if he were controversial.

This new bill strengthens some of the most important parts of the CARES Act especially the popular Paycheck Protection Program which is saving millions of American jobs as we speak.

Ten million Americans were laid off in just the last two weeks. Tomorrow morning will likely bring another historic unemployment figure. This is urgent.

We can't ignore that in today’s Democratic Party what were once easy questions have become divisive flash points:  Standing with Israel. Maintaining our presence in the Middle East.    Increasingly these things are controversial. #AIPAC2020,2020-03-03 14:30:56,Twitter for iPhone,242,1006
In many ways #AIPAC2020 marks a promising time for the U.S.-Israel relationship. We in the pro-Israel community have much to celebrate.   But we must also be honest and clear-eyed about challenges. And that includes a dangerous shift in our politics here at home.,2020-03-03 14:26:41,Twitter for iPhone,153,671

After years in Afghanistan two things are clear:   1. We should welcome any serious opportunity to bring greater stability.  2. And we must make certain that the progress won through great sacrifice is not undermined by any precipitous rush for the exits. https://t.co/5fj5sFmnqI,2020-03-03 00:08:48,Twitter Web App,445,1881
I am grateful that the lynchpin of @POTUS' agreement with the Taliban is a conditions-based approach that will give our commanders leverage to test the Taliban’s will to abide by it. This war is not over. But this agreement may foster the negotiations to bring it toward a close. https://t.co/cSHZvkoVvs,2020-03-02 23:05:52,Twitter Web App,983,3716
I’m glad that our prospects for supplemental coronavirus appropriations rest in the hands of a bipartisan group of negotiators. I would encourage my Democratic colleagues to let them do their work. It will be important to pass this first benchmark &amp; supply these important funds.,2020-03-02 21:11:51,Twitter Web App,385,1919
It goes without saying that a challenge like the coronavirus leaves no time for moving goalposts or performative outrage. The American people deserve for Congress to meet this subject head-on with a bipartisan and collaborative approach.,2020-03-02 21:11:50,Twitter Web App,1971,10410

Do our Democratic colleagues really believe that what our country needs is a radical fringe position on elective abortion that we only share with China North Korea and four other countries in the entire world? https://t.co/DvYCXFUkHI,2020-02-25 23:21:33,Twitter Web App,3379,9875
Today every Senator will be able to take a clear moral stand. We’ll have the chance to proceed to two commonsense pieces of legislation that would move our nation closer to the international mainstream with respect to defending innocent human life. https://t.co/AfKbycHhD3,2020-02-25 17:44:27,Twitter Web App,5630,18698

#Kentucky’s treasured coal communities are a central part of our Commonwealth’s heritage. I am proud to stand with our coal miners and their families.

In divided government we have to work on things we agree on.  House Democrats’ left-wing fantasies like the Green New Deal and Medicare-for-None are nonstarters. https://t.co/jBj6YlZChs,2020-02-14 21:25:57,Twitter Web App,1368,4590

This President’s opponents talk all the time about defending norms and institutions. That talk proved very cheap. This partisan impeachment was a series of attacks on the bedrock institutions of our republic. https://t.co/vvTdmk1HkC,2020-02-13 20:40:26,Twitter Web App,2796,8754
In order to politically attack one President they do not like Washington Democrats proved willing to attack our underlying institutions themselves — the House the Senate the office of the presidency and even the Supreme Court. All for short-term partisan gain. https://t.co/sjybEA7otC,2020-02-13 18:04:51,Twitter Web App,12133,39097
Before Democrats’ reckless impeachment moves fully into the rear-view mirror I spoke again on the Senate floor about the partisan abuses that drove this process and why they must never happen again. https://t.co/sWRuPRSMYu,2020-02-13 16:07:04,Twitter Web App,4016,13458

Senate Democrats spent years saying “when it comes to Iran we should never take the military option off the table.”  But now after criticizing the successful strike on Soleimani they want to pass a resolution to limit President Trump’s authorities. https://t.co/IjyHS3M3dc,2020-02-11 22:20:12,Twitter Media Studio,11621,33030

The architects of this impeachment claimed they were defending norms and traditions. In reality it was an assault on both. They attacked due process the office of the presidency and the Senate’s sole power to try impeachments. https://t.co/3iHVzbTFW7,2020-02-05 22:56:44,Twitter Web App,13193,44533
Moments like this are what the Senate was made for. The Framers knew the country would need a firewall to keep partisan flames from scorching our Republic.   So they created the Senate. Today we will fulfill this founding purpose.,2020-02-05 21:01:31,Twitter Web App,14179,63560

Tomorrow the Senate will put a stop to this reckless and partisan abuse of power by the House majority.  I urge every one of my colleagues to cast the vote that the facts in evidence the Constitution &amp; the common good clearly require.

Washington Democrats’ position on President Trump has been obvious for three years: They believe he committed a “high crime [or] misdemeanor” the moment he defeated Secretary Clinton in the 2016 election.   That is the original sin of this presidency: That he won and they lost. https://t.co/FOzXEd0lL3,2020-02-04 18:15:23,Twitter Media Studio,3533,9752
The Framers knew that overheated House majorities might impeach on purely partisan grounds. But they knew that short-term passions could not get the final say. So they placed the ultimate judgment not in the fractious lower chamber but in the sober and stable Senate. https://t.co/tvT7IybPwU,2020-02-04 16:25:25,Twitter Web App,5002,16909

A majority of the U.S. Senate has determined that the numerous witnesses and 28000-plus pages of documents already in evidence are sufficient to judge the House Managers’ accusations and end this impeachment trial.

There were good reasons why all 100 senators agreed two decades ago that the Senate should not cross these bridges before we came to them.

It will be telling if the House managers try to get the Senate to pre-commit ourselves to supplementing the investigation they themselves oversaw and decided to shut down.
