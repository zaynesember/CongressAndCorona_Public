When you build an entire campaign on truth and honor and you prove to be not truthful and not honorable and then you spend a month AWOL and hiding from voters and the press I think that says all you need to know about Cal Cunningham. https://t.co/v8W0cuVmVG,2020-10-30 23:36:01,Twitter Web App,44,95

You can trust me to keep my promises and I'll continue to deliver results for NC families.

Thank you for all your kind wishes and prayers!  I am doing well and while I am working from home now I look forward to getting back to Washington very soon to confirm our next Supreme Court Justice — Amy Coney Barrett.   https://t.co/MFjb7C4e4i,2020-10-05 15:58:43,Twitter Web App,53,191
Last night Cal Cunningham refused to take a position on:  ❌Pledge opposing defunding the police ❌Biden's openness to court-packing ❌Biden's Green New Deal ❌Biden’s tax plan  He’s refusing to take positions– because he knows his extreme liberal agenda will cost him your vote. https://t.co/hLmmIduDUM,2020-10-02 20:55:34,Twitter Web App,98,153
It’s simple: Cal Cunningham is an $80 million rubber-stamp for Chuck Schumer and the court-packing-supporting far left which is exactly why he refuses to denounce Biden for not opposing packing the court.   https://t.co/q0eiBwyjWO,2020-10-02 20:40:59,Twitter Web App,48,76
.@newsobserver @theobserver got caught trying to cover up tough questions about Cal Cunningham’s record – it’s disappointing not surprising.   We've overcome left-wing media bias before and we'll do it again.   https://t.co/J4mbrsQnXQ,2020-10-02 16:52:23,Twitter Web App,26,46
This is beyond disgusting and deserves universal condemnation. No one should be rooting for the physical demise of President Trump or any other fellow human being. https://t.co/LZNgq7NIv9,2020-10-02 15:21:52,Twitter Web App,33,64
Cunningham's unwillingness to call on Joe Biden to oppose packing the Supreme Court further displays that he is just an $80 million rubber-stamp for the radical left and will vote however his liberal DC benefactors tell him to. https://t.co/JtkznYLR0W,2020-10-02 14:21:40,Twitter Web App,24,50
While just this morning Cal Cunningham laughed at &amp; rejected signing a pledge not to defund police he then tried to do a 180. We found the video.   You deserve a Senator who supports police not an anti-police candidate who will mislead lie &amp; say anything to get elected. https://t.co/LFHs60D5Ga,2020-10-02 03:06:07,Twitter Web App,48,78
"I just don't believe that I can trust Cal Cunningham to act on what he said tonight. Because he's said anything to get elected in 2000 -- he made a tax pledge he broke it. He said whatever he had to do to get elected." https://t.co/XLTqQf1EGR,2020-10-02 00:09:17,Twitter Web App,28,39

Chuck Schumer is spending $80 million to elect Cal Cunningham. A vote for Cal Cunningham is a vote for radically liberal government. https://t.co/C3AXOwSUOt,2020-10-01 13:19:25,Twitter Web App,66,105

Joe Biden continues to leave the door open to packing the Court.   Unless Cal Cunningham denounces Biden then North Carolinians should fully expect him to side with his benefactor Schumer &amp; vote to pack the Court with activists who will impose the liberal agenda from the bench. https://t.co/qbGX4N5FIa,2020-09-30 15:26:16,Twitter Web App,23,52

You know where I stand: I will vote to confirm Judge Barrett.

Why can’t the American people know the names of the judges Joe Biden &amp; Cal Cunningham would advance onto the Supreme Court?
