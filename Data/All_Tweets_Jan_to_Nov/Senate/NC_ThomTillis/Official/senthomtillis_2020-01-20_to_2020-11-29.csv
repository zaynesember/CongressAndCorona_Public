In 2011 for example Senate President Phil Berger and then-Speaker (now U.S. Senator) Thom Tillis (R) passed Senate Bill 368 legislation that modified public swimming pool requirements.

Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats denied the @realDonaldTrump basic due process rights from the start and ultimately presented a weak case for removal that was rejected by the Senate. The President has been acquitted and we now need to move on. (2/3),2020-02-05 21:46:33,Twitter Web App,61,297
This entire impeachment effort was motivated by partisan politics and a desire to remove @realDonaldTrump from office instead of allowing the American people to decide his fate at the ballot box in November.  (1/3),2020-02-05 21:46:32,Twitter Web App,233,1216
