When the counting starts is a function of state law.

The next President should know all of the parts of the government and how they interact with each other.,2020-03-12 03:07:57,Twitter for iPhone,926,6597
The lack of testing should be a career ending mistake. I’ve never seen Dow futures plummet like that when a President speaks. People need testing social distancing beds respirators good advice food paid leave oxygen tanks and scientific integrity not a payroll tax cut.,2020-03-12 03:02:58,Twitter for iPhone,13137,51405
So many angry tweets not sent. I do think it’s important for me to dial back the snark during a situation like this but I just want to say that I have a lot of angry tweets that I’m not sending.,2020-03-12 02:56:25,Twitter for iPhone,839,16213
Mr. President how the media treats you is not the main thing. The main thing is to #FlattenTheCurve. Please ask Dr. Fauci what that means and how to do it. Markets and media coverage will improve if you focus on the disease. https://t.co/6fs4EAN7i1,2020-03-11 22:20:10,Twitter for iPhone,197,1087

The reason the economy is teetering is people are afraid - its a demand problem. Demand will return when people feel safe. So we should do what Korea did - aggressively implement testing and best public health practices. A bailout for the shale oil industry protects no one.,2020-03-10 23:27:42,Twitter for iPhone,2251,11167

This is disgusting. We are the most advanced country in the history of humanity and we are bungling the deployment of tests. This is an emergency and the administration’s response is proposing a bailout to the oil industry. https://t.co/T00AMQz3xY,2020-03-10 19:57:04,Twitter for iPhone,694,2212
They did not cut taxes. They did not bail out companies. They just attacked the public health emergency. The way to enable economic recovery is focus on public health. https://t.co/9avqBJ9hLX,2020-03-10 18:40:23,Twitter for iPhone,10156,35387
