“Republicans first announced their intention to fill Justice Ginsburg’s seat just one hour after the announcement of her death.  From that moment this process has been nothing but shameful.

“We should not have had a nomination before Justice Ginsburg was even buried while the nation was mourning her passing.

Little known fact:    Not only did Pres. Trump release the Ukraine aid so late in the fiscal year that we in Congress had to re-appropriate $35 million so it didn’t expire - but nearly half of that remains UNSPENT TO THIS DAY.   So NO the aid was not all “eventually released.”,2020-01-29 20:51:31,Twitter Web App,617,1197
Trump has NOT treated Ukraine more favorably than his predecessors.

The investigations-for-aid demand caused both harm &amp; foul: •Delayed aid jeopardized Ukraine’s defense against Russia •That &amp; withholding a WH meeting nearly compelled Ukraine to meddle in our elections •Signaled to Russia that our support for Ukraine was not a priority,2020-01-29 20:38:41,Twitter Web App,21,80
I just asked Managers about POTUS’ claim Ukraine ultimately got aid so no harm/no foul.

SCOTUS made clear that impeachment is a vital safeguard against presidential “misconduct” or “abuses of office.” Even House Rs’ witness agrees a pres. “can be impeached for a noncriminal act.” And even AG Barr has written non-criminal "abuses of discretion" are impeachable. /3,2020-01-28 19:46:18,Twitter Web App,13,57
No federal criminal laws EVEN EXISTED when the impeachment clause was adopted. Arguing that impeachment requires a violation of a non-existent body of laws is nonsensical.

FACT CHECK: The President’s lawyer just argued that President Trump has steadfastly battled corruption. NOT TRUE.

Let’s not be distracted by arguments that have nothing to do with the actual LAW. The law provides no excuse for blocking John Bolton’s testimony. The Senate must not be complicit in a cover-up. /6,2020-01-27 17:48:33,Twitter Web App,37,149
• Any claim of privilege can be resolved quickly by Chief Justice Roberts and by the Senate which is sitting as a court of impeachment. This won’t get tied up in court for weeks or months. /5,2020-01-27 17:48:33,Twitter Web App,28,112
• Executive privilege has ALREADY BEEN WAIVED. When President Trump talks or tweets about his conversations with Bolton those conversations are NO LONGER PRIVILEGED. /4,2020-01-27 17:48:33,Twitter Web App,23,87
• Executive privilege can be overcome if the testimony would “contain important evidence” which “is not practically available from another source.” John Bolton’s testimony easily meets that standard. /3,2020-01-27 17:48:33,Twitter Web App,14,76
• Executive privilege can’t be used to cover up wrongdoing. @USGAO already found the hold on Ukraine aid violated the law. /2,2020-01-27 17:48:32,Twitter Web App,20,80
There’s a lot of talk about John Bolton and executive privilege. We should be absolutely clear about this: There is NO legal basis to block Bolton’s testimony. The law is clear: /1,2020-01-27 17:48:32,Twitter Web App,102,360
False. He ONLY released the aid —AFTER he was caught —DAYS BEFORE the Ukrainian Pres was going to cave &amp; announce the baseless investigations &amp; —So LATE that @USGAO found he BROKE THE LAW &amp; forcing Congress to RE-APPROPRIATE $35m before it expired (some of it STILL unspent) https://t.co/jM02FiPtAa,2020-01-27 16:24:15,Twitter Web App,292,737
John Bolton and other key witnesses Trump blocked MUST testify.   This isn’t about politics. This isn’t about loyalty to a party or president.   It’s about the truth.

I just left the trial where the Pres’ attys claimed a letter from Sens.

FACT CHECK: Pres. Trump’s False Claim Equating His Illegal Ukraine Aid Freeze With Pres. Obama’s Lawful Legitimate Pauses On Aid https://t.co/WTFuJyYEhL https://t.co/uMfra2uBZ7,2020-01-24 20:38:06,Twitter Web App,84,154
The argument that impeachment requires a technical crime is simply made up. It’s certainly not grounded in reason or history let alone in the Constitution. In fact the first federal criminal statute was enacted THREE YEARS AFTER the impeachment clause was adopted. https://t.co/YJGJTPzE6w,2020-01-24 18:03:20,Twitter Web App,61,148
Great to see VLS launch the Vermont Legal Food Hub &amp; I’m proud to have secured the USDA funds to make it possible. In #VT a thriving local food system is important both economically &amp; culturally. This resource makes it easier to work through legal issues starting a farm/food biz. https://t.co/NFp3UUMi1S,2020-01-24 17:35:05,Twitter Web App,13,38
Yes I do.  I personally have SEEN when the U.S. Senate has risen to represent the Conscience of the Nation. https://t.co/XQxIiCa9Bg,2020-01-24 12:27:45,Twitter for iPhone,55,249

ALL of these holds were done under statutory authority included consultation w Congress &amp; promoted key US natl interests. UNLIKE Pres Trump &amp; Ukraine funds NONE were to promote personal interests. NONE were concealed from Congress. NONE were found illegal by a govt watchdog https://t.co/bXJFZzKPu3,2020-01-23 23:47:50,Twitter for iPhone,1371,2649

WRONG. ALL these holds were done under statutory auth. incl. consultation w Congress &amp; promoted imp. US natl interests. NONE were to promote personal interests. NONE were concealed from Congress. NONE were found illegal by a govt watchdog. Can't say that about your actions. https://t.co/f6Lf7uEps1,2020-01-23 15:55:14,Twitter Web App,4081,10731

Earlier today Pres. Trump boasted about his obstruction of Congress taunting that "we have all the material. They don't have the material." The Senate is a coequal branch with a constitutional obligation to pursue the truth. It’s time we start acting like it.,2020-01-22 18:08:38,Twitter Web App,56,132
It's an INSULT that Trump has provided more to the public via FOIA than he's given to Congress which has constitutional oversight powers. I wrote an Op-Ed on this point last week: https://t.co/rvmRfpxmdI,2020-01-22 18:08:38,Twitter Web App,41,88
The FOIA'd docs also reveal that MULTIPLE Republican lawmakers reached out to the Trump admin concerned about the Ukraine aid hold. Where are those concerns from Republicans now?,2020-01-22 18:08:38,Twitter Web App,25,46
Despite RAMPANT abuse of FOIA exemptions &amp; redactions (literal cover ups) the docs show WH staff laying the groundwork for the unlawful aid hold the DAY BEFORE and EVEN DURING Trump's infamous call with Pres. Zelensky. Don’t Americans deserve the full story?,2020-01-22 18:08:37,Twitter Web App,24,49
While Senate Rs voted to blindfold the Senate to key docs &amp; witnesses that Trump blocked the House from considering thanks to #FOIA more damning bits &amp; pieces of the truth emerged late LAST NIGHT about Trump’s ILLEGAL Ukraine aid freeze.

Another word for it: A travesty. I applaud @WeAreOversight’s tenacity. But the Senate has a constitutional obligation to obtain the FULL docs. All of them. That's EXACTLY what Democrats tried to do yesterday only to be blocked at every turn by the GOP.   https://t.co/B0sxO3JMSW,2020-01-22 17:37:58,TweetDeck,23,62
Voted well beyond Midnight on amendments to McConnell sham trial resolution. Party line votes prevented the Senate from requesting any documents or witnesses that President Trump blocked the House from considering. Not a good day/night for the Senate.,2020-01-22 10:03:39,Twitter for iPhone,102,416
We just recessed for a short time. I would hope later today and in the days ahead the President’s lawyers remember they are addressing the United States Senate and personal insults and falsehoods will not serve them well. https://t.co/xQofP3ydQe,2020-01-21 20:11:23,TweetDeck,369,1166
We’ll now learn if the Senate can still function as the co-equal branch the Founders envisioned or if it's wholly subservient to the Executive. With last minute release of McConnell’s trial rules—w/no witnesses &amp; arguments in the middle of the night—it’s not a good start.,2020-01-21 14:32:40,TweetDeck,153,472
