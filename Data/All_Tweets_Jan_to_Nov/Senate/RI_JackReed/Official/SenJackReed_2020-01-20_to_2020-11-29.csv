All presidents have the power to pardon people who are guilty of crimes. But this was a self-serving use of that power and seems to be the beginning of a process to try and shield Pres Trump and his entourage from accountability. https://t.co/xJw1K8yqbU,2020-11-27 00:44:43,Twitter Web App,131,499

Small businesses have a big impact on our economy &amp; they need our help. While many folks plan to #ShopLocal for #SmallBusinessSaturday Congress must to do its part to provide #smallbiz relief.

Ascertainment was step one. Now Senate Republican leaders must take step two and allow a COVID-relief bill to come to the floor so Congress can swiftly pass a bill to protect public health &amp; people’s economic well-being.,2020-11-24 01:03:00,Twitter Web App,81,365
In a long overdue move Pres Trump’s @GSA Administrator just signed the #ascertainment paperwork to allow presidential transition to proceed.

Sec. Mnuchin knows pulling the plug on these economic support programs now will make it harder to resuscitate the economy.  If Pres Trump hadn’t lost the election &amp; Sec.

When a #COVIDvaccine is ruled scientifically safe it should be FREE for all Americans. Trump Admin initially was going to let #redtape force some seniors to pay.

QUESTION: Why are Senate Republicans rushing this process &amp; putting 1 person's #SCOTUS nomination above the health &amp; welfare of the nation?   ANSWER: https://t.co/GHXPbzI6oF,2020-10-26 20:07:58,Twitter for iPhone,15,50
Make no mistake: Tonight’s #SCOTUS vote isn’t about 1 individual. It's about the GOP jeopardizing #healthcare for 20 million+ Americans during a pandemic. It's about eliminating protections for 100M+ Americans with #preexisting conditions. We must #ProtectOurCare.,2020-10-26 19:07:40,Twitter Web App,46,190
Heading to the Senate floor to oppose the #SCOTUS nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett &amp; condemn this rushed irregular process - undertaken in the midst of a pandemic - that wrongly prioritizes 1 person’s lifetime appointment over the health &amp; welfare of the American people.,2020-10-25 23:30:29,Twitter Web App,162,890
It’s not complicated. Some folks don’t want to believe the President wants his #SCOTUS nominee to kill the #AffordableCareAct. But take him at his own word: https://t.co/qu9lnphyns,2020-10-22 21:52:10,Twitter for iPhone,35,95
SMOKING GUN PROOF: Pres Trump is rushing an extreme lifetime #SCOTUS nominee (w/ help of Senate GOP) to terminate the #AffordableCareAct. Ripping away people's healthcare in midst of a pandemic will harm public health &amp; further destabilize the economy. https://t.co/4uCKWQBCaA,2020-10-22 19:47:20,Twitter Web App,27,53
The U.S. Senate must help combat #COVID; deliver relief for struggling families biz &amp; communities; &amp; turn our economy around. Instead GOP leaders chose a lifetime job for 1 extreme #SCOTUS nom. over #publichealth the health of our economy &amp; the needs of hardworking Americans. https://t.co/eImNNwYp81,2020-10-21 19:01:22,Twitter Web App,71,199

Having #healthinsurance can be the difference between life &amp; death. The Trump Admin is suing in federal court to get #SCOTUS to strike down the #ACA &amp; eliminate critical health protections for millions of Americans. We must #ProtectOurCare.

With a pandemic raging #SCOTUS let Pres Trump end the #2020Census early. Pres Trump doesn’t want an accurate count. He thinks an incomplete count will help him &amp; GOP politically.

Red &amp; blue states alike are pleading for additional federal help. Congress &amp; Trump Admin must listen &amp; act. The #CARESAct was well-intentioned but didn't do enough.

Nobody wants to hear this but we're still in the early stages of the battle vs. #COVID19. We can get it under control. But to stop it from returning we can't allow our defenses to crumble. We must invest more in testing hospitals &amp; health workers #PPE research &amp; vaccine.,2020-04-09 14:36:01,Twitter Web App,63,186
States &amp; communities are facing stark decisions &amp; taking bold decisive action to save lives.

Hospitals are on the front lines of #COVID19 pandemic &amp; Sen. McConnell knows they need more help.

Let's focus on where Repubs &amp; Dems agree: The #CARESAct aimed high but not high enough. More help is needed.

Sen. McConnell is performing a bit of political theater requesting only $250B for #smallbiz. Dems will counter seeking $250B for Small biz + $150B for states + $100B for hospitals. GOP will object. Then real work of negotiating &amp; legislating begins...,2020-04-09 14:13:14,Twitter Web App,17,47

A quick history of why Emergency Coronavirus Relief package is delayed &amp; where we’re at:  - Bipartisan Taskforce works on bill - McConnell scraps bipartisan work &amp; adds $500B slush fund - Dems say no way - Bipartisan talks resume progress - McConnell show votes slow things down,2020-03-23 18:12:36,Twitter Web App,90,169

Helping health workers hospitals the unemployed small businesses &amp; states is key. It’s time for Sen McConnell to tear up his $500B #TrumpSlushFund &amp; put #WorkersFirst.
