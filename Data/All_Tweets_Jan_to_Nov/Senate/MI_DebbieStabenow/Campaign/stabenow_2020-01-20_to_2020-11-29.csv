From the beginning of this pandemic I said that we needed a national testing strategy. #TotallyUnderControl shows the Trump administration's failure to use testing to slow the spread of COVID-19! #TotallyUnderControl,2020-10-30 23:42:51,Twitter Web App,10,47
The Trump administration threw out the pandemic playbook. Then they eliminated key positions that deal with global health outbreaks.   @realDonaldTrump  chose politics over listening to experts that knew how to deal with a global pandemic. #TotallyUnderControl,2020-10-30 23:30:33,Twitter Web App,20,46

Did @RealDonaldTrump really say at #Debates2020 that Michigan had our best year ever?  Wrong.

It is for that reason and the fact that I believe Michigan voters should have a say through their vote in selecting the next Supreme Court Justice that I am opposing Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination and will do everything I can to stop it! (3/3),2020-09-26 21:26:05,Twitter for iPhone,18,159

Should she become our next Justice Amy Coney Barrett will decide cases that impact millions of lives. This is urgently true because immediately after the election the Supreme Court will hear a Donald Trump backed case that could overturn the Affordable Care Act.

The Trump administration's latest effort to undermine government scientists is dangerous for our future. Instead of sabotaging scientists it's time to listen to them and start taking action to solve the climate crisis!  https://t.co/gbFG4pEP13,2020-03-02 19:51:35,Twitter for iPhone,5,24
We have to respond and help Michigan communities dealing with damage from high-water levels. That means doing everything we can to repair the destruction right now while taking action to end the climate crisis in the long term! https://t.co/SRuGqEJDBw,2020-02-21 23:16:22,Twitter for iPhone,3,29
Please watch @GaryPeters’ new ad. Gary is a fighter for Michigan workers - I see it every day working side by side in the Senate. Gary has our backs and I’m proud to have his! https://t.co/47r1hQpzvc,2020-02-20 20:23:36,Twitter for iPhone,114,222
What a performance by @Eminem! Once again Detroit brings down the house! https://t.co/UgIlYqdEgd,2020-02-10 13:04:59,Twitter for iPhone,6,84
Service to others. Delivering results and getting things done. I can't think of a better way to describe @GaryPeters and his tireless commitment to Michigan. Let's do everything we can to have Gary's back this November! https://t.co/Qij4yKYypd,2020-02-10 02:00:21,Twitter for iPhone,61,161
Jeffrey was an amazing person and an incredible advocate. I can’t wait to see this film about my friend. https://t.co/xnzqIrqfwR,2020-02-09 14:12:19,Twitter for iPhone,3,30

Thank you @gretchenwhitmer! You made Michigan proud. You put it best last night when you said “We’re capable of great things when we work together.” We are so lucky to have you fighting in Lansing for Michigan families! https://t.co/VFnlYqqke8,2020-02-05 14:58:58,Twitter for iPhone,19,148
I’m in. 😎 https://t.co/hEQ5CoF3in,2020-02-04 17:52:55,Twitter for iPhone,15,165
Thank you @DrRobDavidson for standing up for the nearly 700000 Michiganders who depend on Healthy Michigan for their health care! https://t.co/pfDMPbiGUe,2020-01-31 20:16:22,Twitter for iPhone,93,387
Another broken promise from Donald Trump. After a lifetime of work seniors deserve to know Medicare services will be there for them when they need it most. Democrats and Republicans should be coming together to strengthen Medicare for Michigan families!  https://t.co/UnzZrLdr0T,2020-01-23 20:20:59,Twitter for iPhone,14,51
Sending love and prayers... https://t.co/mwSoizWH4n,2020-01-21 17:52:34,Twitter for iPhone,1,35
These are challenging times for our country. No matter how great our differences we must reject the forces of hate that seek to divide us. As we reflect on Dr. King's legacy today let's draw strength from his message of unity and love. #MLKDay https://t.co/mwqQGJnG6b,2020-01-20 13:44:40,Twitter for iPhone,1,43
