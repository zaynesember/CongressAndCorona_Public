Lastly but most importantly we need to increase @NIH funding.  The only way to #EndAlz is by finding out how it works through increased research and advocacy.   #WorldAlzheimersDay is a reminder to bolster our resources in this fight.,2020-09-21 20:25:54,Twitter Web App,1,9

We need to... 💼 Extend unemployment benefits 🏠 Increase housing protections &amp; food assistance 😷 Address racial disparities 💰 Pass state &amp; local aid 🏥 Support our hospitals and nursing homes 🧪 Ramp up testing and vaccine production ...and much more.,2020-08-03 18:25:08,Twitter Web App,5,19
Instead the GOP's plan doubles the tax break for business lunches from 50 to 100%.  Not a PENNY more for families going hungry...but corporate executives lucky enough to still have jobs during this crisis get free three-martini lunches? 🍸  That’s absurd.,2020-08-03 18:25:08,Twitter Web App,11,14
Stopped by @CUMACFeeds today a Paterson non-profit that’s been struggling to meet growing demand as unemployment rises &amp; communities are strained for resources.

Nearly 150000 NJ small businesses have relied on #PPP loans under $150000 to help survive #COVID19.

✅ When the school year begins this fall schools will need serious resources—regardless of whether they're providing remote or in-person instruction.    ❌ The GOP’s #HEALSAct fails to provide them &amp; furthers Trump’s brazen efforts to force schools to reopen—despite the risks. https://t.co/tCsNLb4XrF,2020-08-03 13:49:17,Twitter Web App,24,35
✅ If you’re black or brown you’re more likely to get sick or die from #COVID19.

Medicare and Medicaid turn 55 today but with Trump’s attempts to gut them…they might not make it to 56.  This would jeopardize millions of Americans’ health and well-being.

✅ Our communities are on the verge of bankruptcy—faced with the decision of laying off workers or raising taxes.

The State Department stands as our first line of defense on all these fronts to ensure that America does not become less secure. To keep America at the forefront we must build retain and stand up for a diplomatic corp that embodies the best of our nation. #DiplomacyInCrisis,2020-07-28 19:36:49,Twitter for iPhone,5,10
President Trump’s responses to a renewed focus on racial injustice have exacerbated already-low morale and left @StateDept employees questioning commitments to diversity and contemplating leaving the Department. #DiplomacyInCrisis https://t.co/9GN84lLKld,2020-07-28 19:35:59,Twitter for iPhone,3,4
Meanwhile as the nation struggles to confront persistent racial injustices diplomats abroad face significant challenges in representing the U.S. and ideals our nation embodies to the rest of the world.   @StateDept itself has had significant challenges with regard to diversity. https://t.co/PqwdGqnCRr,2020-07-28 19:35:57,Twitter for iPhone,4,4
As a result @StateDept employees report that their morale and confidence in senior leaders have dropped precipitously.  Many are far more fearful today than 3 years ago to report a violation of law and are equally afraid they will be subjected to reprisal. #DiplomacyInCrisis https://t.co/HwJRT2psHD,2020-07-28 19:35:55,Twitter for iPhone,3,5
Meanwhile Sec. Pompeo has been M.I.A. when it comes to defending his staff &amp; organization from politically-motivated attacks.  He urged the ousting of @StateDept’s Inspector General who is charged with conducting independent oversight &amp; was investigating Pompeo’s own conduct. https://t.co/gEpzXLyNBO,2020-07-28 19:34:01,Twitter for iPhone,5,9

Unqualified and unfit candidates have exacerbated vacancies and leadership failures at the State Department.  Trump nominees have misrepresented their experience misled the Senate and engaged in conduct that would have been disqualifying under previous administrations. https://t.co/dWJuOIsI1v,2020-07-28 19:33:58,Twitter for iPhone,5,7
The @StateDept has also witnessed an alarming number of departures—from the most experienced career personnel to early-and mid-career staff—and a stunning loss of expertise. #DiplomacyInCrisis https://t.co/iBNOuiJLIe,2020-07-28 19:30:47,Twitter for iPhone,4,5
Assistant Secretaries key ambassadorships and other senior positions have sat empty for months—in some cases years—without nominees for Senate confirmation.

Public servants at @StateDept are dedicated to serving the nation—regardless of party president or politics.

It’s simple: States with disproportionately high infection rates will face higher costs...and they’ll likely need to continue the stay-at-home orders for longer leading to even larger revenue losses.

When we treat allies and partners like enemies or marks to be taken advantage of we shouldn't be surprised when they are not interested in working with us.  This is not winning. This is losing. And on a massive and strategically costly scale.,2020-01-28 23:37:31,Twitter for iPhone,10,28
While I’m disappointed that the U.K. has opted to work with #Huawei given the real security risks that this creates today’s decision is an entirely predictable result of the Trump Admin’s failed foreign policy. https://t.co/tJSjMLdMPk,2020-01-28 23:37:31,Twitter for iPhone,11,26

John Bolton’s account of his conversations with Trump is the smoking gun that should shake Senate Republicans to the core.  We can’t wait for the #ImpeachmentTrial to be over.  We can’t wait for his book to be published.  We need to hear the truth. #BoltonMustTestify https://t.co/tvuoGi3SFe,2020-01-27 18:07:15,Twitter Web App,26,60
BOTTOM LINE: A strong and democratic Ukraine is key to U.S. success in countering Putin’s aggression against American security interests.  President Trump should stop undermining our national security to benefit Putin.,2020-01-27 17:14:38,Twitter Web App,13,22
2️⃣Ukraine moving closer to the West threatens Putin’s core strategic interests.  That’s why in 2014 Putin ordered the invasion of Crimea and began a military conflict in eastern #Ukraine where Ukrainian forces continue to fight Russian-backed forces today.,2020-01-27 17:14:38,Twitter Web App,8,14
1️⃣Ukraine is on the front lines of Kremlin aggression.  W/o an adequate response to Russia’s violation of the international rules based order it will be emboldened to engage in disruptive behavior elsewhere (ex. MidEast &amp; Africa where Putin bolstered dictators &amp; war criminals),2020-01-27 17:14:38,Twitter Web App,6,9

Glad I got to talk to @DanaBashCNN this morning about the #ImpeachmentTrial.  One thing is clear: the GOP’s attitude is that of a jury that's determined to deliver a verdict before they've heard all of the testimony. https://t.co/Js4efZq0za,2020-01-24 00:15:51,Twitter Media Studio,8,23
Hi Mary—While the House cannot add new articles of impeachment to the current trial new evidence can be offered at the Senate trial.  However @SenateGOP voted to block ALL attempts by @SenateDems to subpoena documents and witnesses that could help us uncover the truth. https://t.co/TLUdX5P3SE,2020-01-23 22:47:50,Twitter Web App,15,25
Trials have witnesses and documents. Cover-ups don’t.  That’s why the American people want to hear from John Bolton Mick Mulvaney Michael Duffy and Robert Blair. https://t.co/sHkddZ4ZmC,2020-01-23 19:36:09,Twitter Web App,262,616

Senate Democrats are demanding what the vast majority of the American public wants: a fair trial with witnesses and documents directly relevant to the charges against President Trump.  Why is @SenateMajLdr so afraid of giving us that?,2020-01-22 23:07:21,Twitter for iPhone,60,169

Brief update on what happened in yesterday’s #ImpeachmentHearings: ➡️ @SenateGOP struck down every amendment to subpoena documents &amp; witnesses ➡️ It’s clear that McConnell doesn’t just want a sham trial but a trial the American people barely get to see ➡️ The real question: WHY?,2020-01-22 16:57:57,Twitter Web App,16,29
