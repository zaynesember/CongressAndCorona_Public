FACT: The Obama-Biden admin’s foreign policy deliberately strengthened the communist regime in Cuba.  Under Trump America has reversed course &amp; stood w/ the people of Cuba instead.

.@realDonaldTrump is right. In June on @AEI_WTHIGO w/ @DPletka &amp; @MarcThiessen I said it’s unacceptable that American lives are dependent on the whim &amp; discretion of the CCP &amp; that we need to decouple our economy from China.
