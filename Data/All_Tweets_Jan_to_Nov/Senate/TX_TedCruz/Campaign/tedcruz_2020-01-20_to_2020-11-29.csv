2/x And as Norm knows well:  Filling vacancies is not “packing the Court.”  The Senate’s Advice &amp; Consent (confirming or not confirming individual nominees) is not “packing the Court.”  What FDR tried &amp; Biden plans to do—expanding the number of Justices—IS “packing the Court.”,2020-10-20 13:25:14,Twitter for iPhone,409,1778

I wrote One Vote Away not knowing we'd have a Supreme Court vacancy in October...  I wrote it because I think the single most important issue on the ballot on Election Day is #SCOTUS &amp; I wanted to take readers inside the Court for a behind-the-curtain look https://t.co/uSZFy3mEbm https://t.co/zaW6tW1Xy4,2020-10-11 13:11:29,Twitter Ads,283,1131

There are two possibilities:  (1) Dan Rather for decades CBS’s lead news anchor doesn’t know what court “packing” (increasing—as FDR tried to do—SCOTUS from 9 Justices to a larger number for political benefit) is; or   (2) he’s intentionally lying.   Which one is it? 🤔 https://t.co/XuC1V7OLnc,2020-10-11 02:05:24,Twitter for iPhone,4645,14157

3/x NYT Executive Editor Dean Baquet was caught in a leaked transcript admitting it blatantly political: “We built our newsroom to cover one story [Russia collusion] &amp; we did it truly well. Now we have to regroup and shift resources and emphasis to take on a different story.”,2020-05-04 20:32:16,Twitter for iPhone,339,1210
2/x NYT: "[America’s] founding ideals were false when they were written." "The US is a nation founded on both an ideal &amp; a lie." "[O]ne of the primary reasons the colonists decided to declare independence was because they wanted to protect the institution of slavery." ALL FALSE.,2020-05-04 20:23:56,Twitter for iPhone,389,1570
Pulitzer epically beclowns itself. Prize supposed to go to work that “adheres to the highest journalistic principles.” NYT’s 1619 project is explicitly not journalism; it is propaganda. In NYT’s words: “It aims to REFRAME OUR COUNTRY’S HISTORY.” It’s based on FALSE premises. 1/x https://t.co/sIZ5iZkqOm,2020-05-04 20:22:31,Twitter for iPhone,3326,9376
They are Dem hacks not journalists. Imagine this NYT editorial:  “allegations have arisen that President Nixon was behind the break-in at the Watergate. The media cannot investigate. We believe the Committee to Re-Elect the President should launch a ‘thorough’ investigation.” https://t.co/iKLiP3rjR4,2020-05-04 03:46:24,Twitter for iPhone,576,2039
It’s who they are. They don’t even pretend anymore. https://t.co/iKLiP3rjR4,2020-05-04 03:42:15,Twitter for iPhone,621,3081
Amazing Freudian slip from NYT.  It’s the same principle as Bloomberg media saying “we won’t investigate Mike Bloomberg as a candidate because he’s our boss.” https://t.co/wcKW2sjb8W,2020-05-03 21:14:40,Twitter for iPhone,459,1257
There’s a hierarchy in Leftist values. #1: Trump BAD. #2: Must defend Chinese communists. Apparently both 1 &amp; 2 are more important to the Left than free speech artistic expression or gay rights.

This should be a wake up call for anyone who still defends China. The Chinese Communist Party engaged in a global coverup endangering millions &amp; they have blood on their hands.   China is the greatest geopolitical threat facing the US for the next century. We need to act like it.,2020-05-03 20:13:42,Twitter for iPhone,1997,6051
Horrifying. US intel confirms the Chinese Communist Party knew at the highest levels the #CoronavirusOutbreak would turn into a global pandemic so much so that they secretly changed their policies to stockpile medical equipment &amp; hide imports/exports. https://t.co/JuOld7kloe,2020-05-03 20:12:29,Twitter for iPhone,5723,10439

@AndrewTKnudsen Yours is an argument that the virus wasn’t bio-engineered—ie created in a lab. I have no reason to doubt that. What the circumstantial evidence suggests—which needs to be vigorously investigated—is that the labs were studying this (natural) virus &amp; it accidentally escaped.,2020-05-01 17:11:00,Twitter for iPhone,45,249
Why is Obama’s former Deputy National Security Advisor apologizing for the Chinese communist govt &amp; denying their responsibility for this global pandemic?  Here’s a detailed thread rebutting this laughable WaPo “fact check”: https://t.co/YYyuttioP2 https://t.co/6MZ5vUs4pU,2020-05-01 16:54:33,Twitter for iPhone,378,907
10/x And is it relevant that WaPo is owned by Jeff Bezos the richest man in the world who stands to make billions in China if he pleases the communist overlords? Whatever WaPo is doing this is NOT journalism. It is apologizing for the CCP trying to cover up their culpability.,2020-05-01 16:51:28,Twitter for iPhone,266,918
9/x ...source Dr. Daszak? Well his organization “EcoHealth Alliance” was receiving (now cancelled) US taxpayer $$ to support bat coronavirus research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology! Why does WaPo NOT disclose his enormous bias litigation exposure &amp; conflict of interest??,2020-05-01 16:47:24,Twitter for iPhone,187,787
8/x That’s it. Those two counter-facts form 100% of the basis for WaPo’s “fact check.” And #2 the claim that “China’s been incredibly open” is laughably absurd. They DESTROYED THE LAB SAMPLES. They PUNISHED &amp; SILENCED the pandemic whistleblowers. And who is this objective...,2020-05-01 16:42:45,Twitter for iPhone,161,668
7/x WaPo COUNTER-FACT TWO: They quote Dr. Peter Daszak the head of “EcoHealth Alliance” as saying “China’s been incredibly open. I believe it’s because it’s a scientific collaboration &amp; in China they’re really proud of their science; they do good work especially in virology.”,2020-05-01 16:39:04,Twitter for iPhone,113,500
6/x...basis? WaPo COUNTER-FACT ONE: The CCP and the lab director (who initially wrote “could [the pandemic virus] have come from our lab?”) now deny it. “Shi her team &amp; the Chinese govt have adamantly denied that it could have come from this lab.” WaPa takes that denial as true.,2020-05-01 16:32:31,Twitter for iPhone,128,571
5/x...conclusion? “The balance of scientific evidence strongly suggest the conclusion that the new coronavirus emerged from nature be it in the Wuhan market or somewhere else.” This is a non sequitur. None of the aforementioned evidence leads to that conclusion. What’s WaPo’s...,2020-05-01 16:26:08,Twitter for iPhone,142,619
4/x ...that they were afraid what the samples if examined would show.  ALL OF THESE FACTS strongly suggest the virus escaped from one of these CCP labs. At this point the evidence is circumstantial (because the CCP is hiding/blocking any direct evidence). BUT what is WaPo’s...,2020-05-01 16:22:00,Twitter for iPhone,158,639
3/x ...safety concerns resulting in multiple US Dept wires—before this crisis—warning that shoddy safety protocols could lead to a global coronavirus pandemic.  FACT 4: WaPo admits China DESTROYED the lab samples after the pandemic started (raising the natural inference...,2020-05-01 16:17:34,Twitter for iPhone,178,704
2/x FACT 1: WaPo admits two separate labs in Wuhan were studying coronaviruses derived from bats. One lab was just 300 yards from Wuhan wet market. FACT 2: WaPo admits bats with similar coronaviruses “live in caves 1000 miles away.” FACT 3: WaPo admits both labs had SERIOUS...,2020-05-01 16:07:53,Twitter for iPhone,275,921
1/x “Amazing” is definitely right word for this video. WaPo “abandoning all pretenses of journalism to produce CCP propaganda” would be another way to put it. If this reporter submitted this video in a freshman logic class it wouldn’t receive a passing grade. Let’s review facts. https://t.co/IWjl5kIlMq,2020-05-01 16:02:08,Twitter for iPhone,1099,2718
