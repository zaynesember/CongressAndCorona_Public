The stakes have never been higher. Senator Perdue and Senator Loeffler are in the battlefield fighting for our Republican Senate Majority in Georgia and they need help from across the country. https://t.co/3bRIFssGcw,2020-11-23 17:00:54,Twitter Web App,4,7
I didn’t vote for Donald Trump four years ago. I didn’t vote for him in the primary. I didn’t vote for him at the convention. And I didn’t vote for him in the general election.  But this year I am voting for President Trump. Let me explain why... https://t.co/rFrLGXZmEe,2020-10-29 21:52:04,Twitter Web App,9,44

Martha McSally is a friend and trusted colleague.  She’s fought for the United States as a fighter pilot and she is still fighting today as a senator.  We need her in the Senate! https://t.co/omIKTkcpsz,2020-10-27 02:52:36,Twitter Web App,246,696

Conservatives want President Donald Trump to name someone in the mold of Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas and the late Justice Antonin Scalia. Amy Coney Barrett is exactly that kind of nominee. That’s why I hope and expect it will be her. https://t.co/der3gBQIWe,2020-09-23 21:56:13,Twitter Web App,6,25
Earlier this week the Supreme Court acknowledged that Casinos in Nevada could be open but not churches. Do you think more should be done to protect religious freedom? https://t.co/AvqonzAD9f,2020-08-01 18:11:17,Twitter Web App,6,17

Today was a big win for abortion providers and a huge loss for the unborn and the Constitution. There is no right to abortion in the Constitution and the Supreme Court's highly selective use of stare decisis defies logic and reason.,2020-06-29 16:14:25,Twitter for iPhone,6,9
Thomas Massie is one of the most principled members of a Congress. I’m so glad he won his primary this week. Everyone should donate to his campaign to get him across the finish line in November.  https://t.co/CiqgIw0NEw https://t.co/pH6apF6jSR,2020-06-25 04:55:02,Twitter for iPhone,4,8

There is a frightening effort underway to increase surveillance powers of the federal government. There have been abuses of the FISA process in the past and we need to restore safeguards to Americans’ privacy. https://t.co/KvCQCUoJOB,2020-05-12 16:35:02,Twitter for iPhone,4,11
I was so sad to learn of Tom Coburn’s passing.  Senator Coburn was a friend and example to all who knew him and I feel deeply blessed to count myself among those who did.  My thoughts and prayers are with Carolyn and the rest of Tom’s family.,2020-03-29 13:10:44,Twitter for iPhone,1,8
The House FISA deal doesn’t fix what’s wrong with FISA.  It would not have stopped the spying that occurred against @realDonaldTrump.  I will do everything I can to oppose it in the Senate.  If it passes @realDonaldTrump should veto it.,2020-03-11 01:39:49,Twitter for iPhone,2,12
Three provisions of FISA are set to expire on March 15th.  Congress should not reauthorize them without reform.  Our intelligence-gathering agencies need to focus on foreign agents and terrorists and should not be spying on U.S. citizens.  Do you agree? https://t.co/EK1KnzRAbV,2020-02-27 16:59:19,Twitter for iPhone,15,26
