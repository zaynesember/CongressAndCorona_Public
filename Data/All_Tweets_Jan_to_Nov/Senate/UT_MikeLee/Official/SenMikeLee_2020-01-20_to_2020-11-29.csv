@VP thank you for standing up to the Green New Deal!  It would disempower and empoverish Americans.,2020-10-08 01:41:19,Twitter for iPhone,60,295
@VP it’s clever when they can get the debate moderator to essentially say that climate change policy is beyond dispute.,2020-10-08 01:40:34,Twitter for iPhone,18,111
@VP wildfires rage in areas where the federal government manages too much land.  It’s an environmental disaster.  True environmentalists should demand reform for federal land ownership and management.,2020-10-08 01:39:35,Twitter for iPhone,41,119
@KamalaHarris bad things happen when we put an almost religious amount of faith in government.  Governments are neither inherently good nor inherently evil.  They are just coercive force.  That is all.,2020-10-08 01:38:03,Twitter for iPhone,2,13
@KamalaHarris if you claim that anyone who disagrees about what government can and cannot do “they’re coming for you.”,2020-10-08 01:37:05,Twitter for iPhone,5,15
@KamalaHarris yes that’s why everyone calls what we had until a few months ago “the Biden Economy.”  Oh wait no one does.,2020-10-08 01:36:04,Twitter for iPhone,4,9
@KamalaHarris how can you repeal the Trump Tax Cuts without raising taxes on poor and middle class Americans?  (Hint:  you can’t).,2020-10-08 01:34:58,Twitter for iPhone,16,40
We’re not a democracy.,2020-10-08 01:34:02,Twitter for iPhone,7372,44447
@VP yes @realDonaldTrump has reduced the tax burden on poor and middle class Americans.  Utahns benefitted from that as he signed into law at my urging provisions increasing the per-child tax credit thus offsetting the parent tax penalty.,2020-10-08 01:33:47,Twitter for iPhone,24,103
@KamalaHarris when government is spending money it’s not an “investment.”  That doesn’t mean whatever is being done isn’t a good idea but money taken at the point of a gun—which is what taxation is and does—is not properly characterized as an investment.,2020-10-08 01:32:08,Twitter for iPhone,4,10
@KamalaHarris what are you doing to address the debt and deficit?  Will you support a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution?,2020-10-08 01:30:44,Twitter for iPhone,3,10
@KamalaHarris don’t hurt America’s poor and middle class by adding to their burdens.  That’s what your $4 trillion tax hike would do.,2020-10-08 01:30:08,Twitter for iPhone,7,15
@VP good job explaining that government often helps people most by getting out of their way and letting them do what they do best.,2020-10-08 01:29:02,Twitter for iPhone,50,210
@KamalaHarris @VP  be careful not to label anything you like or think is a good idea a “right”; rights are things the government can’t do to you (or be enlisted to do to you).,2020-10-08 01:27:37,Twitter for iPhone,4,5

@VP and @KamalaHarris governments don’t create pandemics.  They can’t necessarily stop them.  Governments are not God.  When we politicize everything including acts of God we cheapen the very concept of government.,2020-10-08 01:22:08,Twitter for iPhone,48,152

@KamalaHarris “clearly it hasn’t worked.”  What does that mean?  What would you have done that would have worked?  What would @JoeBiden have done other than attacking @realDonaldTrump for being xenophobic?  Statesmanship means more than hurling insults.,2020-10-08 01:14:55,Twitter for iPhone,3,7

@KamalaHarris yes it’s airborne.  And yes they knew and they told us.,2020-10-08 01:08:59,Twitter for iPhone,5,23
Government is the official use of coercive force—nothing more and nothing less.  The Constitution protects us by limiting the use of government force.,2020-10-08 01:07:24,Twitter for iPhone,138,501
The word “democracy” appears nowhere in the Constitution perhaps because our form of government is not a democracy.  It’s a constitutional republic.  To me it matters.

If you’re on social media today and agree please get the word out on this and contact your Senators. It’s not too late. The bill isn’t finished. A big bipartisan coalition can still win this. We can #GoBig4Charity. Who’s with me? (15/15),2020-03-22 15:31:47,Twitter Web App,42,186
This is not a partisan or ideological issue. It’s more like a blind spot we want everyone to see. Congress is understandably focused on business liquidity. We’re digging deep to rescue the economy. We have to do the same for our equally important civil society. (14/15),2020-03-22 15:31:47,Twitter Web App,17,97
That’s why a one-year charitable deduction is essential to a comprehensive coronavirus relief package. Rs and Ds are ready to #GoBig4Charity. We just need the chance to show it. The base bill can still be changed or we try to offer a bipartisan amendment on the floor. (13/15),2020-03-22 15:31:47,Twitter Web App,17,67
This morning millions are attending virtual church services in their living rooms praying that this crisis passes. And it will. And when it does we’re going to need those churches and all our service orgs back on the front lines to rebuild and renew our communities. (12/15),2020-03-22 15:31:46,Twitter Web App,9,68
And based on conversations I’ve had the last few days with Republican and Democrat colleagues I am morally certain that there is overwhelming bipartisan support for a huge-but-temporary one-year policy fix for the charitable giving deduction. (11/15),2020-03-22 15:31:46,Twitter Web App,7,53
This year we’re going to *want* all Americans – especially rich ones! – pouring their money into local charities. If there must be a cap $300000 or $30000 makes *much* more sense than $300. (10/15),2020-03-22 15:31:46,Twitter Web App,15,87
The American people are ready to “go big” with their own personal contributions to the national relief effort. But Congress has to help them do it. In all honesty for this one year the deduction shouldn’t be capped at all. (9/15),2020-03-22 15:31:45,Twitter Web App,10,60
Non-profits are looking at shortfalls this year in the tens maybe hundreds of billions of dollars. Ten percent of U.S. jobs are in the non-profit sector. These organizations don’t need a bailout – they need blow-out. Just this one time this one year. (8/15),2020-03-22 15:31:45,Twitter Web App,5,45
This is crucial. Fixing the charitable deduction for 2020 may give our relief efforts the best policy bang for the buck. Unfortunately the draft proposal would cap this special one-time deduction at… $300 per person! That’s short by at least one zero. (7/15),2020-03-22 15:31:45,Twitter Web App,8,60
The good news is negotiators of Phase 3 are aware of this need. The first draft includes a 1 time 1 year fix that moves the charitable deduction “above the line” on 2020 tax forms. That would enable all tax filers to deduct charitable donations from their taxable income. (6/15),2020-03-22 15:31:45,Twitter Web App,7,63
Ivy League universities and the Smithsonian Institution may be fine. But small and medium-sized local non-profits – the lifeblood of American culture cooperation and community – are going to be hanging by a thread. Congress has to make them a priority.

Think about what months of social distancing and shrunken family budgets will do to churches charities soup kitchens homeless shelters drug rehab centers museums elderly outreach libraries youth sports leagues orchestras and theater companies? (4/15),2020-03-22 15:31:44,Twitter Web App,8,58
It’s not just the for-profit economy that is suffering and will suffer from the COVID outbreak. Civil society – all those millions of non-profits around the country – are getting hammered too. (3/15),2020-03-22 15:31:44,Twitter Web App,6,51
In D.C. the theme of the relief effort is to “go big.” Members on both sides want to overwhelm the fears and uncertainty now strangling our economy. But in this crisis it’s not enough just for the *government* to “go big” – we have to empower *everyone* to go big too. (2/15),2020-03-22 15:31:43,Twitter Web App,4,63

@realDonaldTrump:  Every senator who agrees with you (I certainly do) should vote against proceeding to the Pelosi-Nadler-Schumer FISA bill on Monday.  No fake reforms!

@realDonaldTrump:  Per your concerns we should delay consideration of expiring FISA provisions for 45 days—reauthorizing for a few weeks to give us time to improve the FISA bill passed by House Democrats.

Congratulations @realDonaldTrump.   I’m looking forward to your next five years in office. Those who voted to remove you were wrong.  Very wrong.,2020-02-05 23:58:29,Twitter for iPhone,12338,69115
Yes we badly need to restore and protect the separation of powers ordained by the Constitution. But it is because of separation-of-powers concerns and not in spite of them that this impeachment effort must fail. 3/3,2020-02-05 20:59:35,Twitter Web App,57,315
And while the House managers repeatedly invoked constitutional principles including separation of powers their arguments tend to prove a point opposite of what they intended. 2/3,2020-02-05 20:59:35,Twitter Web App,54,271
This has been a trial of the Washington D.C. establishment itself but not necessarily in the way the House Managers intended. 1/3 https://t.co/9wt1BL6FEn,2020-02-05 20:59:34,Twitter Web App,75,373
Fantastic news out of @HHSgov. States can now use their Medicaid expansion dollars to enable new health insurance plans free of Obamacare’s burdensome regulations. This is a good step towards market driven health care. https://t.co/czKAqOF1r8,2020-02-03 20:21:28,Twitter Web App,85,305
13 witnesses is more than enough. Let's move on to final arguments Monday and acquittal Wednesday. https://t.co/VYF78H5Hxg,2020-02-01 16:56:05,Twitter Media Studio,205,920
But even more importantly he leaves behind a tremendous legacy as a husband father friend proud native of Rose Park and member of @LDSchurch. Through all of his gifts and talents he always sought to serve others and lead them to Christ.,2020-02-01 16:26:04,Twitter Web App,12,114

Mitt Romney is a good friend and an excellent Senator. We have disagreed about a lot in this trial. But he has my respect for the thoughtfulness integrity and guts he has shown throughout this process. Utah and the Senate are lucky to have him.,2020-01-31 23:45:15,Twitter for iPhone,2765,25902
4/4 the material facts of the case are not in dispute.,2020-01-31 23:14:40,Twitter for iPhone,47,321
3/4 these facts. That is why I voted to move on without hearing from additional witnesses.  Like any other trial court the Senate – here sitting as a court of impeachment – has both the authority and the obligation to decline to hold a full trial where,2020-01-31 23:14:39,Twitter for iPhone,49,291
2/4 to issue a statement announcing an investigation into ‘Burisma and the 2016 elections.’ President Zelensky declined. Ukraine received its aid anyway and President Zelensky met with President Trump. That’s it. That’s what happened. No new witness would change or contradict,2020-01-31 23:14:37,Twitter for iPhone,45,212
1/4 We have heard from 13 witnesses via video during this trial. We have heard hours of argument. We have received hundreds of pages of legal briefs and thousands of pages of supporting documents. We know what happened: President Trump directed his staff to ask President Zelensky,2020-01-31 23:14:36,Twitter for iPhone,112,569
Would President Bush have been subject to impeachment charges based on his handling of NSA surveillance detention of combatants or use of waterboarding? https://t.co/L7FQibZPDR,2020-01-30 23:47:58,Twitter Web App,194,645
Under the standard embraced by the House managers would President Obama have been subject to impeachment charges based on his handling of the Benghazi attack the Bergdahl swap or DACA? https://t.co/PlfvH8HNxg,2020-01-30 23:47:27,Twitter Media Studio,720,2670

The House Managers have argued aggressively that the president’s actions contravened U.S. foreign policy. Isn’t it the president’s place – certainly more than the place of career civil servants – to conduct foreign policy? https://t.co/U1Iu0ITTKi,2020-01-29 19:46:50,Twitter Media Studio,1084,3172

Huge win for #ReligiousLiberty on this #MarchForLife day. HHS Office for Civil Rights has issued a notice of violation to California for their 2014 rule banning over 28000 insurance policies that did not cover abortion.

After 33 days of delay managers argued this was urgent. After hearing from 17 witnesses managers said they need more. After hours of speeches managers insulted the President his counsel and the Senate itself.
