@j4mtr4y I’ve lived the American dream. I was born very poor. Starting at age 12 I worked multiple jobs to put myself through parochial school college and law school. I became an attorney and ran a successful law practice. I’m a conservative so I invested and saved and it’s paid off.,2020-11-03 21:05:29,Twitter for iPhone,0,0
