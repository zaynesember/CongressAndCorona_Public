The fact is VP Biden met with Hunter’s business partner Devon Archer only 6 days before Devon joined Burisma’s board and only 27 days before Hunter joined. What DID they discuss at the White House? Inquiring minds want to know.,2020-08-17 16:59:54,Twitter Web App,980,2442
We are supposed to believe VP Biden was oblivious to what Hunter was up to?  VP Biden claims “I have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.”  To quote VP Biden again “Come on man.” How believable is this denial?,2020-08-17 16:54:57,Twitter Web App,966,2561
In fact the Burisma deal was so concerning to Hunter’s business partner (Secretary of State Kerry’s stepson Christopher Heinz) and State Department officials that none of them wanted any part of it.,2020-08-17 16:54:20,Twitter Web App,927,2284
The truth is VP Biden and Hunter were involved in conduct that created a real quandary for U.S. and Ukrainian officials who wanted to fight corruption.,2020-08-17 16:51:15,Twitter Web App,1043,2542
The reaction to my series of tweets regarding @JoeBiden and Hunter’s glaring Ukrainian conflict of interest on Friday and Saturday is interesting.  To paraphrase Jack Nicholson in “A Few Good Men” it looks like some people simply can’t handle the truth.,2020-08-17 16:50:13,Twitter Web App,7685,17204
This scheme was hatched and implemented within the span of 1 month and only 2 months after more than 100 Ukrainians lost their lives revolting against corruption. The media covers for VP Biden by repeatIng “no evidence of wrongdoing or illegal activity.” What do you think? (10),2020-08-15 14:50:42,Twitter Web App,1864,4202
An interesting article in @FDRLST quotes a study from Watchdog Research showing a similar sized US company typically pays board members $55000 to $83000 a year. Hunter was paid 7.2 to 10.9 times that amount. Again great gig if you have the right name. (9),2020-08-15 14:48:52,Twitter Web App,1609,3629
BTW the average American household works hard to earn 10% of what Hunter Biden and his firm were paid by Burisma. It’s nice to have the right last name and friends in high places. (8),2020-08-15 14:47:42,Twitter Web App,1286,3162
And how much did Zlochevsky pay Hunter and Devon for that protection?  Public reports say Hunter and his firm were paid $3 million over the next 5 years - more than $600000 per year - for doing what? (7),2020-08-15 14:46:20,Twitter Web App,1376,3121
BTW don’t you think that Mykoloa Zlochevsky would have made sure Ukrainian officials desperate for U.S. support knew that Hunter Biden was on his board? I’ll bet he did. The obvious message to those Ukrainian officials: “If you want U.S. support leave Burisma alone.” (6),2020-08-15 14:44:38,Twitter Web App,1247,3035
Fifteen days later on May 13 2014 guess who joins the board of Burisma?  That’s right Hunter Biden.  Another sheer coincidence? (5),2020-08-15 14:43:52,Twitter Web App,1939,4387
Six days later British officials seize the London bank accounts of Zlochevsky containing $23 million.   I guess that might be a sign that Obama administration officials were correct to view him as highly corrupt. (4),2020-08-15 14:43:23,Twitter Web App,1342,3113
The very next day Devon Archer joins the Board of Burisma a Ukrainian gas company owned by Mykoloa Zlochevsky a Ukrainian oligarch generally viewed as highly corrupt.   A mere coincidence? (3),2020-08-15 14:42:36,Twitter Web App,1485,3368

The timeline of @JoeBiden and Hunter’s multimillion-dollar Ukrainian conflict of interest is revealing.  Only two months after revolution to rid Ukraine of corruption Hunter’s business partner Devon Archer meets VP Biden at White House.  Doesn’t that seem a little odd?
