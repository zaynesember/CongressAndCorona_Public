Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats have once again pushed partisan legislation adding unrelated provisions and using political games to prevent necessary funds from reaching our servicemembers and their families.,7/31/2020 17:06,Twitter Web App,62,140
Congress owes that support to the brave men and women who risk their lives to protect our nation.  Even in today’s partisan times I hope we will continue to stand together to support national security and our servicemembers. https://t.co/wuhek7N3G0,7/21/2020 18:31,Twitter Web App,0,5
