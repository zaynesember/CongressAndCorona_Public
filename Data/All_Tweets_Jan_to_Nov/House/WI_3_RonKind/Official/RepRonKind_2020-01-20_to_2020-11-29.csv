Today @RepDelBene @RepTerriSewell &amp; I sent a letter to the Administration urging for temporary tariff relief as we continue to face a health care supply shortage &amp; a dramatic need to help companies ride out this economic crisis. https://t.co/rnIk3wtzeO,2020-03-24 23:17:23,Twitter for iPhone,3,9
For more than 2 years businesses &amp; working families have been footing the bill for tariffs implemented in reckless trade wars. Now these tariffs are impacting the ability for our health care workers to get the medical supplies they need to fight #COVID19. Now more than ever we...,2020-03-24 23:17:21,Twitter for iPhone,4,15

In order to combat the spread of #COVID19 we have to be able to test people &amp; get the results quickly. Right now hospitals across WI are facing extreme challenges because they don’t have enough supplies to test patients.This morning I led the WI delegation on a letter... https://t.co/LIDTqBzYDq,2020-03-19 16:52:38,TweetDeck,5,15

IMPORTANT TAX UPDATE: After my colleagues on the @WaysMeansCmte  &amp; I sent a letter to the IRS asking for tax season to be extended you now have 90 extra days to pay your federal income taxes if you owe less than $1 million penalty &amp; interest free.   https://t.co/9DmuEDaczj,2020-03-18 21:53:53,Twitter for iPhone,5,9
Today I announced changes to office operations intended to protect constituents &amp; staff while ensuring that my offices &amp; I can continue serving the people of #WI03. These changes can be found in the link below. https://t.co/YIKivCXqLk,2020-03-13 19:35:08,Twitter for iPad,0,0
Amid the growing concern of the spread of #COVID19 it is important that my office take the necessary steps to protect both constituents &amp; staff from being exposed to COVID-19. However I will not stop working for the people of #WI03 &amp; neither will my office.,2020-03-13 19:35:08,Twitter for iPad,1,6
Health care costs should not have to be a factor when it comes to Wisconsinites staying safe &amp; healthy during this outbreak. This morning @RepBarragan @RepLoriTrahan &amp; I introduced legislation to ensure #COVID19 testing is FREE for seniors on #MedicareAdvantage.,2020-03-12 16:07:59,TweetDeck,4,23
@DHSWI ...&amp; it was great to have Dr. Van Dijk there to help discuss preventative measures #COVID19 preparedness in Wisconsin and government action.  For more information I encourage everyone to visit https://t.co/9M2kG6m9z0,2020-03-10 19:13:18,TweetDeck,0,4
Thanks to @DHSWI Deputy Sec. Julie Willems Van Dijk for joining me on my telephone town hall last night. Making sure that everyone has access to accurate information is one of my top priorities... https://t.co/dRejVEdLZ9,2020-03-10 19:12:50,TweetDeck,2,11
Today my colleagues and I surprised @repjohnlewis with a party to celebrate his 80th birthday! John has been a mentor to me ever since I joined the @WaysMeansCmte and it’s always an honor to work alongside him. Here’s to celebrating many more!   https://t.co/caAiK6TF09,2020-03-03 23:25:01,Twitter for iPhone,6,75
Happy to see this ruling that would have removed over 200000 Wisconsinites from the voter rolls overturned by the Wisconsin Appeals Court. The right to vote is fundamental to our democracy &amp;  we must ensure that everyone is able to exercise this right &amp; make their voice heard. https://t.co/2yvVvCC6li,2020-02-28 20:11:38,TweetDeck,5,42
Proud to be named one of the most bipartisan members of Congress! When we work together and find common ground we can tackle the critical issues facing working families and get things done. https://t.co/WXkt8Wv98M,2020-02-25 20:30:31,TweetDeck,5,29
@SenatorBaldwin #HR3 is a bipartisan bill that will finally help level the playing field and stop forcing people to decide between rent or groceries and life-saving medication.,2020-02-24 20:46:05,TweetDeck,4,11
I couldn't agree more @SenatorBaldwin! Thousands of Wisconsinites are waiting for the Senate to act in order to receive much-needed relief from the burden of prescription drug prices. https://t.co/kHKxX0RUUL,2020-02-24 20:45:52,TweetDeck,26,59
Today and every day I’m proud to be a born and raised Wisconsinite. Whether you are rolling out the barrel or jumping around I hope you take some time to celebrate today! #NationalWisconsinDay #WIProud 👐 https://t.co/r83J2AiobQ,2020-02-15 17:00:32,Twitter for iPad,7,22
I take these reports of the Administration's new policy very seriously. I have reached out to Secretary of State Pompeo demanding more information and clarity around this situation. https://t.co/vj15kyqSCv,2020-02-14 20:03:00,TweetDeck,2,11
As a former special prosecutor I find the actions by AG Barr &amp; the Administration deeply troubling. There should be no political influence when it comes to our criminal justice system. Our judicial system has always maintained nonpartisan independence it must stay that way.,2020-02-14 19:41:51,TweetDeck,2,34
You CHEDDAR believe it! Today is #NationalCheddarDay. So many classic American dishes wouldn't be complete without cheddar so let's celebrate one of the Dairyland's most popular and delicious cheeses! 🧀 https://t.co/2zg7AbqMHQ,2020-02-13 19:15:52,TweetDeck,3,12
This is unacceptable. During a medical emergency the last thing patients should have to worry about is being hit with a massive unexpected bill. Today I was proud to support bipartisan legislation in the @WaysMeansCmte that will help put an end to surprise billing. https://t.co/V0kY6YgLnM,2020-02-12 21:19:51,TweetDeck,16,47
Proud to team up w/ @JimPressOffice &amp; have the support of fellow Wisconsinites @RepBryanSteil @repmarkpocan @RepGwenMoore @RepGrothman &amp; @RepGallagher in the fight to stop the spread of CWD &amp; protect our outdoor traditions in the state. https://t.co/GEkhRwjDym,2020-02-11 15:16:37,TweetDeck,0,2
This is just more proof that tariffs are nothing but a tax on Wisconsin farmers workers and families. https://t.co/dC54tOwPGJ,2020-02-10 20:45:20,TweetDeck,6,8
I couldn't be more happy for the De Soto community to finally close this chapter and celebrate the outcome of their hard work and resilience!,2020-02-07 22:05:08,TweetDeck,0,3
In Sept of 2016 flooding destroyed De Soto's football field.

Now that USMCA is finally signed into law my colleagues &amp; I must get to work on reasserting Congress’s role over tariff policy &amp; giving our farmers the true relief they deserve – relief from the Administration’s dangerous tariffs.,2020-01-29 17:04:00,TweetDeck,2,3
USMCA is a renewed commitment between the U.S. Canada &amp; Mexico &amp; I look forward to working with our trade allies to continue advancing a North American economy that creates good-paying jobs and is in line with our values.,2020-01-29 17:03:33,TweetDeck,0,4
Today after months of work #USMCA finally made its way across the finish line. My colleagues &amp; I on both sides of the aisle worked hard to turn what was once a hastily negotiated agreement into a trade deal that is more pro-dairy more pro-worker and more pro-enforcement. https://t.co/IjgMzLudtq,2020-01-29 17:03:17,TweetDeck,1,4

@GovEvers But it can't just stop here we need federal trade policies that level the playing field &amp; give WI farmers fair access to the export markets that they need. I look forward to continuing to work alongside Gov. Evers as we fight to protect our dairyland family farmers.,2020-01-23 20:07:05,TweetDeck,3,7
I applaud @GovEvers' plan to give our state's dairy industry the long-overdue boost it needs—including increasing dairy exports to 20% of the nation’s milk supply by 2024. https://t.co/cT2gASxcOR,2020-01-23 20:06:40,TweetDeck,20,67
