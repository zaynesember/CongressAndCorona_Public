I agree w/ Dr. Fauci that there is ‘no reason’ Americans can't vote in person as long as they follow proper coronavirus prevention protocols. The bottom line is if you can protest riot and loot in person you can vote in person. Full statement here: https://t.co/5zSgqpbPBX 9/9,2020-08-21 21:36:51,Twitter Web App,337,694
Democrats are using the coronavirus crisis as a means to demand universal mail-in ballots—which are different than absentee ballots—and would be disastrous for the integrity of the 2020 election 8/9,2020-08-21 21:36:51,Twitter Web App,255,611
Mail-in ballots are more susceptible to being stolen or forged and are also more likely to be rejected than in-person votes. In fact Fox News reported that during the 2008 election of Barack Obama about one-fourth of military mail-in ballots were lost. 7/9,2020-08-21 21:36:51,Twitter Web App,176,423
Unfortunately no matter how well the USPS performs when liberal voting states or counties send out thousands of ballots to addresses that are no longer valid or send them to dead people and those who are ineligible to vote the prospects of voter fraud looms large 6/9,2020-08-21 21:36:51,Twitter Web App,148,334
It certainly appears that the USPS under new Postmaster General DeJoy’s leadership is doing everything it can to work with states to ensure vote-by-mail will be successful. 5/9,2020-08-21 21:36:50,Twitter Web App,86,242
Those claiming USPS can't handle the volume of election mail do not realize that on average it handled 471 million pieces of mail every day last year and the 2020 election mail would represent a minor increase in volume which they are fully capable of managing. 4/9,2020-08-21 21:36:50,Twitter Web App,99,264
On June 16 of THIS year Postmaster General Louis DeJoy took over for the Postmaster General who was appointed during the Obama Administration. 3/9,2020-08-21 21:36:50,Twitter Web App,107,263
It is important to note that over 12000 USPS mailboxes ‘disappeared’ during the Obama Admin without any faux outrage emanating from Democrats. The Obama Administration’s USPS actually did that in part because of the steep decline in mail thanks to the rise of the internet 2/9,2020-08-21 21:36:50,Twitter Web App,182,380
