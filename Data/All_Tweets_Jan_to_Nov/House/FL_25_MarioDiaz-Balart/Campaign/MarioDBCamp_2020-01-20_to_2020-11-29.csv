Votes are still being counted in several states w. close elections. Before the press names a new President we should let legal &amp; vote counting process continue &amp; let the states certify their result. Then &amp; only then will we know who will be sworn in as Pres. on January 20 2021,2020-11-07 20:49:17,Twitter for iPhone,9,17
Congratulations my friend @BryanAvilaFL on your impressive win in your race.  It’s only natural you were chosen as Speaker Pro Tempore because of your leadership &amp; integrity as a solider professor &amp; representative.

Some journalists just report taking points others look past the talking points to find the truth. @MarcACaputo dug deep and reported on what was happening in SFL.  He saw what was coming.

La política de EEUU debe seguir apoyando al pueblo #Venezolano y derrotar al régimen y al socialismo no darles legitimidad y oxigeno.
