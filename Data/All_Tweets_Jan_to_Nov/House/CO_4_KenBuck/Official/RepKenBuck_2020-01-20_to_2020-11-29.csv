Doomsday-like predictions of #COVID_19 have created unnecessary panic and reactionary policy decisions.   We need to instill confidence in the American people and hyperbolic reports like Mr. Ferguson’s are making matters worse. https://t.co/amrIBDNny6,2020-03-26 21:46:52,Twitter for iPhone,22,44
Oh great. There’s a special carveout for union bosses too.   In the bill’s current state mid-sized businesses won’t receive assistance if they oppose any union organizing efforts. https://t.co/at92tpTv5R,2020-03-25 22:30:55,Twitter Web App,20,34
Funding for “Washington’s Opera House” has no place in a coronavirus response bill.   We need to focus on policy that will instill confidence in the American people and get our economy back up and running. https://t.co/wykYeD0eHb,2020-03-25 22:03:55,Twitter Web App,94,182
This “coronavirus response” package has special carveouts of $75M for public broadcasting and $50M for museums/libraries.   That’s $125M for pet projects instead of for struggling families and businesses.

We need to reduce our dependence on China and prioritize the American people.

You can’t just slap a new coat of paint on a house with structural problems and call it a day but that’s basically what H.R. 6172 does for FISA.

The PRO Act uses Hoffa-era union intimidation tactics that effectively increase campaign donations to Democrats.   This bill is the Union Boss Wish List overturning state right-to-work laws and forcing employers to handover private worker information to union organizers. https://t.co/gA970MYwuN,2020-02-06 21:20:19,Twitter for iPhone,21,21
Speaker Pelosi’s classless actions at #SOTU were unbefitting of her office and represent how little she cares about our nation’s prosperity and the inspiring stories of the guests mentioned.   That’s why I support @RepKayGranger’s Privileged Resolution to Admonish Speaker Pelosi. https://t.co/OI9pM4f2tY,2020-02-06 18:33:03,Twitter for iPhone,39,95
Sheer madness is right @Trish_Regan.  This year’s #SOTU was one touching moment after another that united this country and yet the Democrats responded by ripping the speech and all it stood for in two. https://t.co/JUUEU9073q,2020-02-06 15:00:26,Twitter Media Studio,20,54

After an optimistic State of the Union last night it is clear that President Trump is ready to move forward and get to work for the good of the American people. #ImpeachmentVote,2020-02-05 21:35:14,Twitter Web App,10,58
But lest we forget Democrats have set a dangerous precedent by pushing a baseless impeachment inquiry through the House. They’ve set the bar so low for impeachment that any future president could be impeached under these new standards.,2020-02-05 21:35:13,Twitter Web App,16,57
The Democrats’ partisan attempt to take down President Trump ended once and for all in the Senate today. With these votes to acquit Congress can move on and get back to work for the American people. I’m glad to see that the Senate has put this impeachment distraction behind us.,2020-02-05 21:35:13,Twitter Web App,19,107
Thanks to Sharyl Attkisson the American people know Clinton lied about Benghazi. She was nominated for an Emmy for her reporting.  Did President Obama thank her for her work? No. Using a highly politicized FBI his administration spied on her. https://t.co/JxTFYmwo0L,2020-02-05 17:11:45,Twitter Media Studio,2705,4662

The allegations of corruption that you see around the Biden family are very troubling. I think that Democratic voters will take that into account when they choose who their nominee is going to be. https://t.co/xedjv3c00N,2020-02-03 23:34:40,Twitter Media Studio,113,348

House Dems rushed through impeachment because they insisted their case was overwhelming &amp; compelling. If that was true the Senate doesn’t need to hear from witnesses.

As commander in chief the president can and should always project force to protect American lives.  But Congress must use its own war-powers role and pass a new AUMF that reflects clear limited priorities in the Middle East not endless war.  https://t.co/Lf3QOJnjq3,2020-01-30 15:08:27,Twitter Web App,7,27

We have just 9️⃣ days until a federal ban on fentanyl expires!  Unfortunately Democrats are more focused on impeaching the president than they are about keeping this dangerous drug off our streets. https://t.co/K5UUTtgvEq,2020-01-28 19:43:00,TweetDeck,169,398
House Democrats didn’t do their jobs.  The House should be the investigative arm of the impeachment process. Instead there was a terrible rush - because somehow the president was a threat to our Republic - and then they held onto the articles of impeachment for nearly a month. https://t.co/Z4bfQqneHa,2020-01-28 19:18:00,Twitter Media Studio,45,104
