The President of the United States just said his Executive Action items would be decided on "August 1st."   It's...August 8th.

On June 11th @MichelleSteelCA said OC is “well on its way to getting out of this situation."   Today 32 people died.  She pushed out health officials.  She reversed a mask order.

32 neighbors family members and friends.  32 lives and livelihoods.  32 futures.   All gone — in a single day.
