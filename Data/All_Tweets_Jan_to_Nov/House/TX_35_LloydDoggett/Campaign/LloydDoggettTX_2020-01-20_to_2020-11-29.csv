Unsatisfied with being a COVID superspreader Trump continues to superspread lies about the election he overwhelmingly lost. As more states certify Biden's win Trump's dangerous unfounded conspiracy theories become more certifiably nuts.,2020-11-24 23:01:08,Twitter for iPhone,3,5

Clear win for Senator @KamalaHarris. Even though he took far more debate time Pence could not answer questions. That reflects on the many failures of this Administration. #VPDebate,2020-10-08 02:42:08,Twitter for iPhone,1,27
Pence said: We are going to win this election. You will decide if he is right or not. Vote. Vote by mail if you can. Vote early if you cannot.,2020-10-08 02:31:07,Twitter for iPhone,4,36
The fact that the moderator even has to ask Sen. @KamalaHarris what would you do if Trump does not relinquish power shows just how far below the norms Trump has dangerously sunk. #VPDebate,2020-10-08 02:28:24,Twitter for iPhone,16,82
Pence totally refuses to answer the question of how the Trump administration will protect preexisting conditions because they will not protect preexisting conditions. #VPDebate,2020-10-08 02:13:26,Twitter for iPhone,22,88
Refusing to consider President Obama's Supreme Court nominee 7 months before the 2016 election Republicans now insist on approving a Trump nominee after voting is already underway. We cannot let them pack the court to terminate the Affordable Care Act. #VPDebate,2020-10-08 02:11:01,Twitter for iPhone,10,48
Just like Trump Pence blames everyone but the administration for coronavirus.  Like Sen. @KamalaHarris says we must set the record straight.   The blame is on you Mr. Pence. #VPDebate,2020-10-08 01:55:21,Twitter for iPhone,20,91
Pence says the Trump Administration will follow the science is this the same Trump “science” that says windmills cause cancer? #VPDebate,2020-10-08 01:49:24,Twitter for iPhone,20,121
Pence says he and Trump have a healthcare plan. It has been almost four years—where is the plan??? Locked in a safe with Trump’s tax returns? #VPDebate,2020-10-08 01:47:03,Twitter for iPhone,42,208
Pence says climate change is real but says the question is the cause.   Nope. Scientific consensus is that we are driving it and we must act. #VPDebate,2020-10-08 01:45:19,Twitter for iPhone,23,95
“The climate is changing.” But it’s no different than 100 years ago according to Pence.  We need climate action now.  #VPDebate,2020-10-08 01:44:36,Twitter for iPhone,4,68
Speaking directly to the American people @KamalaHarris says what’s on the line. If we let Trump and the GOP enablers win your healthcare is on the line. VOTE! #VPDebate #VPDebate2020,2020-10-08 01:43:54,Twitter for iPhone,6,30
Pence says he and Trump have a secret health care plan to protect pre-existing conditions. It’s the same plan Trump referred to in 2016 and has never presented. It doesn’t exist. #VPDebate,2020-10-08 01:42:35,Twitter for iPhone,36,181
Pence takes after Trump interrupting @KamalaHarris. They don’t know respect.   #VPDebate,2020-10-08 01:37:50,Twitter for iPhone,19,154
Pence has yet to meet a question he didn’t dodge...  #VPDebate,2020-10-08 01:31:39,Twitter for iPhone,58,339
Pence questioned about Trump’s misleading info on his health. Trump covers up his health records like he covers up his taxes. What Trump leaves uncovered is his mouth risking the life and health of those who protect and serve him. #VPDebate,2020-10-08 01:30:40,Twitter for iPhone,8,32
What transparency? Trump downplays this illness he downplays its existence. Americans deserve the truth. Americans deserve a leader with a plan. #VPDebate,2020-10-08 01:29:35,Twitter for iPhone,7,36
R-E-S-P-E-C-T!  Senator @KamalaHarris is right. You respect Americans when you tell them the truth not with delay denial and deception with coronavirus magical thinking. #VPDebate,2020-10-08 01:22:46,Twitter for iPhone,25,105
“You respect the American people when you tell them the truth.” -@KamalaHarris   Trump and Pence only know how to mask the truth. #VPDebate,2020-10-08 01:19:58,Twitter for iPhone,19,137
No Mr. Pence. What universe do you live in? It’s not this America where over 210000 have lost their lives. Yet the President says “do not be afraid of COVID-19.” Preventive efforts were replaced with delay denial and deception. #VPDebate,2020-10-08 01:18:19,Twitter for iPhone,7,44
Like Trump Pence cannot answer the question of why America is the worst country in the world for COVID deaths and infections. All he can provide is fawning over Trump. #VPDebate,2020-10-08 01:16:47,Twitter for iPhone,9,61
When asked why the US percentage of deaths is higher than most and 2.5 times more than Canada Pence’s reply was to ignore the question. #VPDebate,2020-10-08 01:15:00,Twitter for iPhone,20,49
Strong opener from @KamalaHarris about the greatest failure of the Trump administration—the inability and absence of leadership during this pandemic. Trump doesn’t have a plan. Biden does. #VPDebate,2020-10-08 01:11:30,Twitter for iPhone,2,20

Trump asks can I be honest?   Answer: No he cannot.  #Debates2020  #PresidentialDebate,2020-09-30 01:59:28,Twitter for iPhone,14,117
Trump cannot give an honest answer to the simple question of whether it is true that he paid only $750 in taxes in 2016 and 2017. #Debates2020,2020-09-30 01:57:18,Twitter for iPhone,12,114
Biden: “He doesn’t want me to answer because he knows I have the truth.”   Truth. #Debates2020,2020-09-30 01:54:51,Twitter for iPhone,7,37
Joe Biden shows how a real president acts instead of Trump who only brings our country shame. #Debates2020,2020-09-30 01:52:24,Twitter for iPhone,13,71
Trump shows that he is completely unhinged and unfit to govern this country. We just have to vote him out and survive until January. #Debates2020,2020-09-30 01:48:48,Twitter for iPhone,33,281
Trump talking about better job numbers is like throwing a ball off the Grand Canyon and claiming it had a great bounce at the bottom — sure but it didn’t make it back to the top not by far. #Debates2020,2020-09-30 01:46:02,Twitter for iPhone,8,48
Trump tries to shut down Biden with the constant interruptions don’t let him shut down your voice or your vote. #Debates2020,2020-09-30 01:44:27,Twitter for iPhone,55,242
By constant interruptions Trump is trying to shut down @JoeBiden like he shut down the economy.   Americans will see through this. #Debates2020,2020-09-30 01:32:41,Twitter for iPhone,11,57
.@JoeBiden sums up Trump’s performance so far “just keep yapping.”   #Debates2020,2020-09-30 01:29:29,Twitter for iPhone,8,91
You can shut up Trump with your vote. Vote him out.   #Debates2020,2020-09-30 01:27:32,Twitter for iPhone,161,732
Trump has absolutely no health plan and that’s why he continues to interrupt and attack Biden.  “He doesn’t know what he is talking about.” Well said Mr. Vice President. #Debates2020,2020-09-30 01:24:28,Twitter for iPhone,6,81
Trump’s claim that he’s bringing down pharmaceutical prices 80 to 90% is the biggest lie so far in the #debate but the night is young so bigger whoppers await. #Debates2020,2020-09-30 01:22:50,Twitter for iPhone,15,95
The moderator is right Trump has never had a plan to replace Obamacare. #Debates2020,2020-09-30 01:19:30,Twitter for iPhone,55,329
.@JoeBiden is right if GOP hypocritically appoints a Justice to SCOTUS the ACA is gone ... in the middle of a pandemic.  #Debates2020,2020-09-30 01:15:25,Twitter for iPhone,4,12
Trump lied to the American people about COVID-19 and its deadliness. He didn't have a plan and over 200000 Americans paid so far with their lives and nearly 30 million are unemployed. Tonight I expect more shameless Trump deflection and denial. #Debates2020,2020-09-30 01:05:15,Twitter for iPhone,2,11
