President Trump has promised over &amp; over again that he wouldn’t cut Social Security.   But that was just another lie.   The #TrumpBudget cuts $24 BILLION from Social Security. It is a complete abandonment of our responsibility to America’s seniors and an insult to our values. https://t.co/Tg57iBqfQT,2020-02-12 17:21:43,Twitter Web App,12,11
After three years of inaction the House finally passed the bipartisan Smithsonian Women’s History Museum Act—authorizing the creation of a national museum to honor all that great American women have contributed to our country.   https://t.co/83N80whLR4,2020-02-12 17:15:51,Twitter Web App,6,12
@realDonaldTrump @EPA @ENERGY It couldn't possibly get worse right? WRONG!   The #TrumpBudget cuts $170 BILLION from student loan programs over the decade. Instead of creating new opportunities for young Americans @RealDonaldTrump's  budget puts college further out of reach. https://t.co/S0fGvNCXdZ,2020-02-11 15:37:24,Twitter Web App,7,12
@realDonaldTrump The #TrumpBudget not only ignores the health burden of pollution and the climate crisis it would make them far worse.   ⬇️Cutting @EPA funding by 26.5% ⬇️Slashing Dept. of @ENERGY's Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy funding by 74%,2020-02-11 15:29:04,Twitter Web App,8,14
@realDonaldTrump To start the #TrumpBudget cuts…  ➡️$900 billion from Medicaid ➡️$182 billion from SNAP  ➡️$70 billion from disability benefits ➡️$500 billion from Medicare - including $130 billion in        funding for Medicare prescription drug pricing https://t.co/hxMvkM2X8X,2020-02-11 15:11:12,Twitter Web App,15,10
Remember when President Trump and Republicans told us that the tax cuts for corporations and the top 1% would "pay for themselves" ?   Well that didn’t last very long.   In @RealDonaldTrump's  budget released yesterday it's clear that he now expects the American people to pay.,2020-02-11 15:00:30,Twitter Web App,28,57
Rep. Cicilline has introduced legislation to #EndGunViolence incl:  ➡️The Disarm Hate Act  ➡️The Unlawful Buyer Alert  ➡️The Assault Weapons Ban  Nearly a year ago the House passed #HR8 a BIPARTISAN bill to expand background checks. It’s time for the Senate to do the same.,2020-02-07 20:04:47,Twitter for iPhone,2,7
This is unacceptable.    #GunViolenceSurvivorsWeek is a chance to honor survivors of gun violence who suffer immense physical &amp; emotional trauma.   It’s also a solemn reminder that there are common sense solutions to #EndGunViolence.   ...Solutions being blocked by @SenateMajLdr,2020-02-07 19:36:22,Twitter for iPhone,4,15
Why are @HouseDemocrats demanding that @SenateMajLdr hold a vote on #HR8?  ➡️Every day 100 people die and hundreds more are wounded by gun violence in America.   ➡️58% of American adults report that they or someone they care for has experienced gun violence in their lifetime.,2020-02-07 19:15:42,Twitter for iPhone,8,17
@RealDonaldTrump's latest attack on the Affordable Care Act via block grants is nothing but a thinly veiled attempt to take away health care from millions plain and simple.

Former House Republicans agreed with @SenatorRomney @RealDonaldTrump's abuse of power was clear wrong &amp; demanded impeachment.

If @RealDonaldTrump's administration succeeds 130 million people with pre-existing conditions like Carrigan’s will lose protections. Federal funding for the Medicaid expansion that she will rely on this year will also be eliminated. https://t.co/UW5jlMjUOB,2020-02-04 18:51:13,Twitter Web App,10,8
