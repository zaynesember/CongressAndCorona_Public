Decades have been spent clearing #landmines from previous conflicts and the U.S. has made significant investments as one of the largest funders of land mine removal.

If Senate Republicans feel “blindsided” by this then they haven’t been paying attention for three years. https://t.co/iH8Ky9VhDz,2020-01-27 15:33:01,Twitter for iPhone,209,1187
Wow. If Senate Republicans don’t let Bolton testify they are aiding and abetting Trump’s cover up. https://t.co/VK6kqyzHf2,2020-01-26 23:54:17,Twitter for iPhone,620,1937
I join those mourning Kobe Bryant his daughter and seven others killed in Calabasas.  An all-time NBA great Kobe captured the imaginations of millions for more than 20 years.  His death leaves us only to wonder what he could have done with another two decades.  Rest In Peace.,2020-01-26 23:08:46,Twitter for iPhone,68,603

What a national embarrassment. Not that it’s any surprise from Mike Pompeo or anyone else in this administration. https://t.co/CpR3xTn661,2020-01-25 02:00:29,Twitter for iPhone,287,1151

Taking nearly a year to respond to Qs about their intentions strategy and legal understanding of an issue as important as VZ is yet another example of the utter contempt this Administration has for the American public and Congressional oversight on matters of military affairs.,2020-01-23 19:44:52,Twitter for iPhone,14,48
Remember that at the time the President and his top advisors including @SecPompeo openly suggested they were considering military action to support the interim President of VZ a step that was neither supported nor authorized by Congress.,2020-01-23 19:44:52,Twitter for iPhone,8,35
Today 344 days after the special advisor for Venezuela Elliot Abrams testified before @houseforeign about the Admin's VZ policy I received a response to the series of questions I submitted for the record from @statedept. https://t.co/iep52vfaHO,2020-01-23 19:44:51,Twitter for iPhone,22,54

Donald Trump has conditioned his supporters to ignore objective facts. We’ve known that for some time.  Now it seems many U.S. Senators are doing the same...despite overwhelming evidence of his impeachable conduct. https://t.co/zzPzT5MHss,2020-01-23 15:00:58,Twitter for iPhone,124,381

On its 47th anniversary #RoevWade is under attack like never before.  Republicans in Congress and across America want to turn back the clock on the progress we’ve made in protecting the freedom of women to control their own bodies.   We can’t let them succeed. #WomensRights,2020-01-22 18:03:48,Twitter for iPhone,80,278

About to join students at Central Falls High School to discuss the 10th anniversary of the disastrous Citizens United decision.

For those watching at home tonight the rules Mitch McConnell just proposed are not the Clinton rules.   Far from it...  Mitch is doing everything he can to cover up for @realDonaldTrump.  This is not what the Framers intended.,2020-01-21 02:09:49,Twitter for iPhone,3780,10314
If McConnell insists on conducting this trial at an hour when most people are asleep that’s a cover up.   The media should describe it as such. Enough of this “both sides” false equivalence. We all know what Mitch is doing here.,2020-01-20 18:27:29,Twitter for iPhone,4548,14515
Today we celebrate the life &amp; legacy of a man that sacrificed everything in the pursuit of equality.  Rev. King’s impact on our nation will be felt forever.
