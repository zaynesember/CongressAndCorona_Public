Mitch McConnell sat on the HEROES Act for 2 months while our economy collapsed and our frontlines went without PPE.

If Senator Markey is running on his record then it must be examined.  He voted for the Iraq war. He opposed the desegregation of Boston public schools.

Ed Markey just said detention bed quotas are a “non-issue.” I disagree.  His choice to side with the GOP and ICE helped rip families apart. Yet he continues to gaslight his constituents on this. These are the politics people are sick of. We need change.,2020-07-26 23:53:51,Twitter Web App,69,265

In 2013 Ed Markey stood with the GOP to defend mass detention. The rest of the Mass delegation stood with President Obama and activists across the country to fight for immigrant families.

Mitch McConnell thought a one-time check was enough for Americans to get by.   He has allowed the HEROEs act to sit idle for months.

We all feel the fault lines of a fractured country. We hear the voices of Americans who are forgotten and forsaken. At this moment we’ll be judged not by the promises we make — but by the promises we keep. https://t.co/uj8VUtlnng,2020-06-14 23:57:00,Twitter Media Studio,117,329

57 years ago Medgar Evers was murdered by the KKK to try and silence his fight for voting rights and desegregation. For decades his murders went uncharged by all white juries. This is our history.

Senator this is a new low. You’ve voted many times to reauthorize 1033 — as recently as 2017 AFTER Donald Trump expanded it. The program is deeply problematic. That’s why I signed onto Rep. Johnson’s bill to restrict it. But let’s be clear: It doesn’t give local police nukes. https://t.co/6Gmi9LVeas,2020-06-12 13:55:40,Twitter for iPhone,92,355
Senator you voted to militarize the police in 2017.   You voted to quadruple funding for prisons.   You voted for the punitive sentencing guidelines that helped create the mass incarceration crisis we have today. https://t.co/igagVTSAfT,2020-06-12 01:23:48,Twitter Web App,77,294

To enact progressive change we have to do more than talk and tweet. We have to put in the work.   I went to nearly 20 states to flip the House in 2018.

Our ‘booming economy’ is a false narrative. We need to look at lived experience.  We need to ensure access to affordable rent and housing.  Eliminate the burden of student loan debt on young people.

The United States Congress the sole entity that can declare war has not done so since WWII.  Yet we’ve been at war for the past 20 years.

More coverups. More lies.  The president first said there weren’t injuries. When he was exposed he diminished the seriousness of the situation calling injuries “headaches.” Now this.
