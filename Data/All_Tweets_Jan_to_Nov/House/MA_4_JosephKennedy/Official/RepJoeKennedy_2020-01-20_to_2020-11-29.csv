For generations the profound injustice the poor and working class face in our civil courtrooms has persisted in the shadows.   I’ll take all the tweets in the world. Let the sunlight in.   We need a Civil Gideon.   (23/23),2020-05-10 15:58:21,Twitter Web App,55,281

And it’s why we introduced our Civil Gideon resolution this week which I’m really proud of. We’ve got some powerful progressive voices like @RepJayapal @RepBarbaraLee @Ilhan &amp; @repmarkpocan on it. (20/23),2020-05-10 15:56:17,Twitter Web App,16,165
That’s why I started the Access to Legal Aid Caucus five years ago. It’s why my colleagues and I have fought for increased funding for civil legal aid every single year. (19/23),2020-05-10 15:55:17,Twitter Web App,24,166
Right now a lack of access to basic legal services puts a price tag on our justice system. It says these protections apply only if you can afford representation. (18/23),2020-05-10 15:55:17,Twitter Web App,24,147
(Worth noting that problems with public benefits are one of the largest sources of legal aid need. When we get Medicare for All - which we will - a strong Civil Gideon will ensure patients have recourse if and when bad actors try to deny them care.) (17/23),2020-05-10 15:55:17,Twitter Web App,16,127
Civil Gideon does not replace bold progressive reforms: It fortifies them. (16/23),2020-05-10 15:54:02,Twitter Web App,22,156
We need Medicare for All. We need shelter and sustenance for all. We need jobs and childcare and clean air and clean water for all. We also need justice for all. (15/23),2020-05-10 15:54:02,Twitter Web App,49,264
Right now we once again face an economic crisis and all the ugly words that come with it: eviction bankruptcy foreclosure debt.   And once again the poor and working class are being left defenseless as our recovery takes shape.   (14/23),2020-05-10 15:52:47,Twitter Web App,23,177
Yet our country’s commitment to civil legal aid is as bone-thin as it is for public defenders.   So there remains a stubborn asterisk to the American promise of equal justice under law: If you can afford it.   (13/23),2020-05-10 15:52:46,Twitter Web App,21,167
But it's hard to overstate what counsel means when your livelihood is at risk. In MA 2/3 of families in eviction proceedings without representation lose their homes. Nationally 2/3 of domestic abuse survivors fail to get restraining orders without a lawyer. (12/23),2020-05-10 15:50:22,Twitter Web App,26,149
For those who have not experienced that power imbalance 'right to counsel' can sound odd.   Lawyers for all? (Though the legal aid attorneys I know are some of the most brilliant and hardworking lawyers I've met – I’d guess that most folks in law would say the same) (11/23),2020-05-10 15:50:22,Twitter Web App,16,154
And those families showed up in court to face a justice system that is supposed to be an equalizer a backstop a protector. Instead they found an endless and impossible maze built only for people who could afford to hire expensive lawyers to lead them through it. (10/23),2020-05-10 15:50:21,Twitter Web App,25,160
I was a legal aid volunteer in Boston Housing Court during the foreclosure crisis. I saw the same thing over and over: Tenants dutifully paid rent. But the landlord fell behind on mortgage. So the lender delivered eviction notices to families that had done nothing wrong. (9/23),2020-05-10 15:48:20,Twitter Web App,28,183
Our country established @LSCtweets in 1974 to help fund civil legal aid for low-income families. But its been targeted for decades; Trump even tried to eliminate it entirely. Half of those who qualify for assistance today don't get it. That’s why we need a “Civil Gideon.” (8/23),2020-05-10 15:48:19,Twitter Web App,39,183
But as we fight hundreds of thousands of low-income families face a legal reckoning today. Medical bankruptcy today. Eviction today. Nearly ¾ of low-income houses had some kind of civil legal problem from housing to health care to divorce. (7/23),2020-05-10 15:48:19,Twitter Web App,23,164
(Now is the time to state the obvious: We want a system with no wage theft no families without shelter no domestic abuse no medical debt. And we are fighting like hell for the kind of big reforms those issues demand – few as critical as Medicare for All.) (6/23),2020-05-10 15:47:18,Twitter Web App,34,236
But no such right exists for civil cases. So families facing eviction domestic abuse survivors seeking protection workers fighting wage theft are forced to stand in court alone. While their landlord employer insurer or abuser has an expensive lawyer by their side. (5/23),2020-05-10 15:46:33,Twitter Web App,40,203
In 1963 Gideon vs. Wainwright established a right to counsel in criminal cases understanding representation as essential to protecting every American’s 6th Amendment right to a fair trial. (4/23),2020-05-10 15:46:20,Twitter Web App,34,164
But for millions of Americans their interactions with our legal system come in the places that don’t make headlines – housing courts family courts bankruptcy claims domestic violence cases and small claims that are anything but small for low-wage workers. (3/23),2020-05-10 15:44:59,Twitter Web App,31,179
Rightfully much of the justice reform conversation in this country centers on criminal justice.   This is a reckoning that is needed and overdue. (2/23),2020-05-10 15:44:59,Twitter Web App,22,137

My economic stimulus plan isn’t a one time deal. Our families need immediate relief during this pandemic — and every year after until the crippling economic aftershocks end.

From climate change to health care to civil rights to economic justice to gun violence to democratic reforms we have fought for all Americans regardless of the color of their skin the god of their prayers or the votes they cast. (4/5),2020-02-05 03:38:58,Twitter Web App,57,497
When I stood in Fall River two years ago to deliver the rebuttal to President Trump’s first State of the Union I told America we did not have to abide by his zero-sum rules. That we could choose both. And that is exactly what @HouseDemocrats have done in the last year. (3/5),2020-02-05 03:38:58,Twitter Web App,34,283
In his three years in office he has relentlessly pursued policies that punish working families and marginalized communities while rewarding corporate interests. (2/5),2020-02-05 03:38:58,Twitter Web App,49,294
Working Americans struggle to make ends meet vulnerable neighborhoods pay the price of a changing climate desperate patients crowd source medical bills and communities of color battle systemic and overt racism yet this President chooses self-adoration over solutions.

Senate Republicans made their choice. They ignored yours.   Their power is temporary. Yours isn’t.,2020-02-01 00:22:01,Twitter for iPhone,24597,101979
Republican Senators can hide from witnesses.   They can hide from the truth.   They can hide from the President’s wrath.   But they can’t hide from history.   And when that spotlight finds them it will not be kind. https://t.co/dviFhgDtv9,2020-01-31 21:10:29,Twitter Web App,889,3615
At least a few GOP Senators have the courage to be quietly disappointed in the President for trying to extort an ally and steal a democratic election for his own political survival. https://t.co/RHJPVD3Zef,2020-01-31 18:15:46,Twitter Web App,161,619
Appease (verb): to yield or concede to the belligerent demands of (a nation group person etc.) in a conciliatory effort sometimes at the expense of justice or other principles.,2020-01-31 17:05:35,Twitter Web App,241,918
For nearly two decades Congress has abdicated its sacred Constitutional responsibility to determine matters of war and peace.   That has to stop. https://t.co/qcFZoB1GFh,2020-01-31 17:01:25,Twitter Web App,195,824
This level of ignorance from this Administration is dangerous.   Patients and providers deserve better than this. https://t.co/EnNJr9J2xk,2020-01-31 16:21:41,Twitter Web App,558,1802
Creating an American grown American based Blue Economy demands that an emerging offshore wind industry be built with American hands. This decision to outsource critical components of offshore wind development is deeply disappointing. https://t.co/WMQ494pWqY,2020-01-31 16:00:35,Twitter Web App,43,149
Watching an American political party unite around the idea that foreign interference in our elections isn’t just legal but encouraged really shows the depth of fear they have for our President’s Twitter account.,2020-01-31 12:46:29,Twitter for iPhone,2089,8472
This nation does not have to stand by helpless as bullets shatter the peace and safety of our communities every single day. The #EndGunViolenceBill will take bold comprehensive action to protect our families and neighborhoods. https://t.co/6rnyWcUAma,2020-01-30 20:51:30,Twitter Web App,96,382
A week after forgetting to renew the public health emergency for the opioid epidemic @realDonaldTrump intentionally moves to take care away from patients battling addiction under his new plan to gut Medicaid. https://t.co/8z1wbyP2zL,2020-01-30 19:50:51,Twitter for iPhone,227,388
You should be angry.   You should be angry that Senate Republicans are pleading ignorance.   You should be angry that they’re willing to set a dangerous precedent to hold onto power.   And then you should channel that anger into taking their power away.,2020-01-30 18:57:15,Twitter Web App,11050,35649
As the title of this new plan makes clear this Administration’s sole mission is to ensure only healthy adults have the opportunity to access health care.   If you get sick or hurt you’re screwed. https://t.co/byghno1fRz,2020-01-30 16:17:50,Twitter for iPhone,378,840
This is bravery and this is determination. But more than anything else this is an inspiration to all who have struggled with mental health. Congrats to Newton Native @GraceEGold on this incredible comeback! https://t.co/HUvsRic0f1,2020-01-29 22:21:23,Twitter Web App,74,514
If @realDonaldTrump chooses to unleash his dangerous plan to block grant Medicaid tomorrow it will underscore the flagrant disregard he has for the health of American patients.  With dozens of our colleagues @repjimcooper &amp; I are demanding he abandon this plan. https://t.co/iQwT8QGoHU,2020-01-29 21:37:33,Twitter Web App,384,861
#IWalkForJustice because we have yet to make good on our fundamental promise of equal justice under law. To all of the advocates bringing this fight to our Commonwealth’s State House tomorrow we’re standing by your side. Please don’t slow down now! https://t.co/xrRpaAGxL2,2020-01-29 17:09:57,Twitter for iPhone,53,338
Our nation’s failure to guarantee #PaidLeaveForAll deepens the inequities and injustice that plague too many working families. @WaysMeansCmte hearing on #FAMILYAct is critical first step. Now Congress must pass this bill and support families.,2020-01-28 20:18:26,Twitter Web App,46,247
Working Americans will lose health care suffer and likely die because of this plan.   That’s not hyperbole or exaggeration that’s the truth.   The Trump Administration should immediately reconsider and revoke it before people get hurt. https://t.co/xQ7HyMzB6a,2020-01-27 22:55:01,Twitter Web App,488,1057
Today #WeRemember the 6 million Jews &amp; millions of others killed during the Holocaust. We remember that global silence let these atrocities grow. And we vow to #NeverAgain let hatred &amp; antisemitism find shelter in this world. #HolocaustRemembranceDay,2020-01-27 20:48:24,Twitter for iPhone,198,1028
Only argument left for GOP Senate to continue this cover-up is that all future Presidents should be allowed to undermine our national security for their own political survival.   It’s that simple. #BoltonMustTestify https://t.co/RdicqTm95X,2020-01-27 16:15:06,Twitter for iPhone,455,1606
Heartbroken for the Bryant family and all who lost a loved one.   Boston sends our prayers.   #MambaMentalityForever https://t.co/8aI5NsLd8s,2020-01-26 23:15:32,Twitter for iPhone,183,2557
We’re talking about kids. We’re talking about their health care. And their government is trying to take it away.    Time to say no way. #NoHB1057 https://t.co/4jDClvjlv9,2020-01-24 19:11:48,Twitter for iPhone,159,599
The opioid crisis was never a priority for this Administration.   If it was they wouldn’t have tried to take treatment options away from millions of Americans battling addiction. https://t.co/4za47BuqeY,2020-01-24 15:01:33,Twitter for iPhone,177,642
Love of country is not measured by loyalty to a president whose only loyalty is to his own political survival.    And you might want to let him know that Russia is not our friend. https://t.co/7dJqtrnLkZ,2020-01-24 14:43:37,Twitter for iPhone,481,2233
Allowing fossil fuel companies to pollute our water will have devastating consequences for our health and our environment.   Time after time this President shows us exactly who he serves: corporations above Americans. #DirtyWaterRule https://t.co/RKMQwa8x3f,2020-01-24 01:08:48,Twitter for iPhone,307,977
For decades the people of Puerto Rico have been deemed second class citizens by our government. That must end today.  That's why I'm demanding that the Trump Administration provide Puerto Ricans with urgent answers &amp; action.  https://t.co/UzEeNZ3snb,2020-01-23 20:17:08,Twitter Web App,153,643
For one hundred years @UnitedWayofCM has empowered families and strengthened communities throughout our Commonwealth. To the staff and volunteers who have made that work possible for generations thank you! https://t.co/JRLBBFKfR3,2020-01-23 16:31:33,Twitter Web App,46,277
In no corner of this country should hate crimes be shielded from prosecution because a victim is gay or trans.   By becoming the 9th state to ban the gay &amp; trans panic defense New Jersey has sent a clear message and our federal government must respond. https://t.co/wY8BAY68Os,2020-01-22 22:29:57,Twitter Web App,137,736
A free nation cannot be true to itself as long as reproductive freedom remains conditional. 47 years after #RoevWade Congress must ensure every woman and every person maintains the freedom to make their own health care choices.,2020-01-22 21:53:05,Twitter Web App,146,814
Now that all his wealthy friends are showering themselves in share buybacks and passive income he can focus on stealing your hard earned retirement and health care. https://t.co/pAl3Qsz0E8,2020-01-22 17:32:12,Twitter for iPhone,1044,2260
Once again proving he believes the military is nothing more than his personal force to be used without repercussion to support his political career.   Our men and women in uniform deserve better from their Commander in Chief. https://t.co/7amh2HqlW8,2020-01-22 14:13:12,Twitter for iPhone,322,1283
By choosing denial and deceit over truth and accountability this complicit GOP has placed their own political survival over the survival of our democratic institutions.   They might proudly violate their oaths as jurors but we won’t abandon our responsibility as witnesses.,2020-01-22 01:27:37,Twitter for iPhone,989,4175
Dark money and unlimited corporate influence only breed corruption in our politics and our government.   We need to #GetMoneyOut of our democratic process by overturning #CitizensUnited immediately.,2020-01-22 00:05:43,Twitter for iPhone,221,1037
Few better grasped the power of the law and channeled it for good than Jim Sandman. While he will certainly be missed at the helm of @LSCtweets I have no doubt that he will continue his mission of access to justice in his next chapter! https://t.co/9U0XlMbVcK,2020-01-21 22:33:18,Twitter for iPhone,23,98
“We estimate 415 North Carolinians would be alive today had we expanded Medicaid in 2014.” Political opposition to Medicaid expansion is costing lives. Time for North Carolina and all states to expand Medicaid. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/GDQ7FbcfuS,2020-01-21 19:29:56,Twitter Web App,161,559
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. believed fiercely in the capacity of his fellow human beings to choose right from wrong good from evil &amp; justice from injustice. We haven’t completed his journey yet but we recommit to his mission today &amp; all days. #MLKDay,2020-01-20 19:15:46,Twitter for iPhone,229,1190
