Actually President Trump managed to build only around 15 miles of new barriers on the southern border.  And now we're likely to get the tunnel.  I still agree with John McCain that America "became the most powerful nation on earth by tearing down walls not building them." https://t.co/tcqDdl6tPo,2020-11-24 23:55:34,Twitter Web App,30,252
@BFlanaganNJ That is possible but it's already happening nights and weekends and already beginning to cause disruptions.,2020-11-24 23:47:38,Twitter Web App,0,0
The answer is no.   There is no way to rebuild the old tunnel while continuing to use it without causing even more commuter hell. We must and now can build a new Hudson River Tunnel and then repair the old one. We need the extra capacity anyway. https://t.co/ZrzLp0J3Wn,2020-11-24 23:05:25,Twitter Web App,21,159

Here's some things Biden won't do: - stay silent about Hong Kong and concentration camps because he's desperate for a trade deal - threaten to pull troops from Japan and S.

Linda Thomas-Greenfield will also be fantastic at the United Nations. She's one of our finest diplomats &amp; was a great partner to me when I was at State.

There is a tradition in America that new presidents don't seek to prosecute their predecessor.  There is also a tradition that outgoing presidents affirm the people's verdict and ensure a peaceful transition.  Someone should tell President Trump that these are related concepts.,2020-11-06 12:28:05,Twitter Web App,88,531
Meanwhile there are plenty of unifying issues on which Biden and Congress can find bipartisan common ground -- a big infrastructure bill for example &amp; an internationalist foreign policy.

So let me get this straight:  it's ok for billionaires to get tax breaks for haircuts and "consulting fees" to their kids but letting middle class homeowners continue to deduct our state and local taxes is a "blue state bailout?",2020-09-28 02:30:13,Twitter Web App,6184,20329
It's clear that the Republicans have a plan to get rid of the ACA and its guaranteed coverage for preexisting conditions and no plan to replace it. Trump obviously has none. Kean articulated none last night. There is nothing on his website. I have a plan: defend the law we have!,2020-09-27 19:10:51,Twitter Web App,13,81
One clear take away: Kean (like Trump) wants us to believe he backs the popular parts of the Affordable Care Act while opposing the law that guarantees them. With a Supreme Court now set to strike down the ACA we must elect a Congress that will protect what the Court will not.,2020-09-27 19:10:51,Twitter Web App,10,77

P.S. the corporations that have invested directly in Kean for this campaign include Koch Industries the pharmaceutical company Allergan and Genie Energy (a natural gas fracking company).,2020-09-26 23:49:26,Twitter Web App,27,119
I am also committed to a constitutional amendment to reverse the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision which allowed unlimited corporate spending on campaigns and legislation to disclose all contributions to groups that influence elections.  My opponent has endorsed neither.,2020-09-26 23:49:26,Twitter Web App,22,143
That's what this no-corporate PAC pledge is about. It's not about saying that any money that ever passes through a corporation is bad! It's about being able to say that I don't owe them a thing so I can make decisions solely based on what I think is right for my constituents.,2020-09-26 23:49:25,Twitter Web App,9,82
I meet corporate execs from my district all the time - we have amazing companies that employ countless people. But when I do I never worry that they might or might not give me money based on how I vote. And they don't have to worry about me hitting them up. We just talk policy.,2020-09-26 23:49:25,Twitter Web App,4,70
The difference here is that he accepts donations directly from corporations. That means he's getting on the phone to their CEO's or lobbyists and asking them for money. And they're not giving it to him from the goodness of their hearts. They're making an investment.,2020-09-26 23:49:25,Twitter Web App,5,67
But in those cases neither Senator Kean nor I have any reason to feel indebted to a corporation that at some point made a campaign contribution to someone else who then in turn chose to back us. We never solicited it from a corporation and they never directed it to us.,2020-09-26 23:49:25,Twitter Web App,5,51
First it's true that both Senator Kean and I have received campaign contributions from sitting members of Congress who support us. And some of those members (including all backing him) accept corporate PAC checks.,2020-09-26 23:49:25,Twitter Web App,5,46
I've been puzzling over why my opponent thinks this is a good argument (disparaging my refusal to accept corporate contributions to my campaign).

Most of the pro Malinowski ads you see are paid for by me with $ I raised myself from actual people who support me.

My personal view is that it would be better to ask schools to do one thing right rather than juggling in-person &amp; remote learning. And the benefits of in-person will be limited if kids can't play or interact with each other and everyone is on edge about masks and distancing.,2020-08-12 13:36:08,Twitter Web App,6,61
Guidelines on issues like masks and mask breaks screening students distancing &amp; quarantine times should be applied uniformly across the state.

@TommybTom More than one thing can be true.  - It's right to peacefully protest Mr. Floyd's killing &amp; what it represents. - Violence against people and property is wrong &amp; must stop. - Any use of the military on US soil must be a last resort and accountable to the people.,2020-06-02 15:01:03,Twitter Web App,1,6

At yesterday's press conference with the Governor I said that @senatemajldr McConnell's opposition to state &amp; local aid was unsustainable and I'm glad to see him say today that he's open to compromise. https://t.co/JUlJcHvj0A,2020-04-28 14:18:05,Twitter Web App,10,50
NJ municipalities must balance their budgets while paying teachers cops and firefighters as the economic slowdown tanks revenue. We need them to survive this and they can't do it alone.,2020-04-28 14:18:05,Twitter Web App,11,42
54 mayors and county freeholders in my district - Democrats and Republicans - have urged Congress to aid local governments endorsing a bill I introduced with 140 bipartisan cosponsors to be included in our next Covid-19 legislation. https://t.co/Bk9m87vyrS,2020-04-28 14:18:04,Twitter Web App,49,153

NJ has given $72 billion more than it received since 2015. Put another way if every state's taxpayers contributed as much as NJ's the federal government would be running a massive surplus not deficit. https://t.co/oYcgZwUz1u,2020-04-26 00:42:07,Twitter Web App,145,466
I'm not going to stand for a Senator telling New Jersey to go bankrupt especially not when he represents a state that gets $2.41 from Washington for every $1 it pays in taxes (in contrast NJ gets only 90 cents).  We are one country and we had better help each other through this.,2020-04-23 18:24:43,Twitter Web App,47,175
Damn straight.  Every local official in my district Democrat and Republican is asking for help to pay teachers and first responders in a crisis not of their making.  Every state in America is losing revenue it needs to keep our public health and education systems functioning. https://t.co/jUG6Wf0Fje,2020-04-23 18:24:43,Twitter Web App,37,172
As you read this story remember some of us were accused of "playing politics" for wanting to fix this program before putting in more $. We got more for community banks but the Senate GOP still refuses to force big banks to treat all customers fairly.  https://t.co/dUXTDjTfe2,2020-04-23 18:06:56,Twitter Web Client,42,78
Tomorrow the House will vote to create a select oversight committee precisely to look into events like this so that Americans can be confident our public health dollars are being spent wisely.  Whoever votes against it is saying they don't want to know what happened here. https://t.co/2QvN7y9JZ8,2020-04-23 01:03:32,Twitter Web App,81,232
Imagine if the head of the World Health Organization had threatened to fire a top official for warning that COVID-19 might be a pandemic!  It would have been exhibit A in the administration's case for firing him. https://t.co/hm1kF4SoVR,2020-04-23 00:22:18,Twitter Web App,38,107
Disney has the cash to keep workers on payroll. Instead it's forcing us to take care of them through unemployment insurance while keeping CEO bonuses.

This is an excellent and timely letter from the Hunterdon County freeholders to Senator McConnell urging relief for smaller counties and municipalities in the next relief bill. https://t.co/yWs896kyxZ,2020-04-22 14:00:53,Twitter Web App,17,80
I’m fighting for both in the next package! https://t.co/Wiqnhtv5ON,2020-04-21 23:58:16,Twitter for iPhone,24,170
President Trump has said that he'll consider support for state and local governments in our next package. That will be one of my priorities along with further fixes to PPP and getting to work on an economic recovery plan that includes investment in infrastructure!,2020-04-21 23:00:01,Twitter Web App,5,30
They also rejected for now our plea to help small town America with support for counties and municipalities that will go bankrupt without some relief. This is a bipartisan demand in my congressional district and around the nation.,2020-04-21 23:00:01,Twitter Web App,10,25
For whatever reason Senate Republican leaders and the White House refused to consider any changes to the small business loan eligibility requirements despite clear evidence that larger well connected companies like Shake Shack went to the front of the line.,2020-04-21 23:00:01,Twitter Web App,5,15
We got another $50 billion for the SBA's disaster loans plus $10 billion for small business grants.    We also secured an additional $75 for our frontline hospitals and $25 billion for Covid-19 testing. The administration finally agreed to pursue a national testing strategy.,2020-04-21 23:00:00,Twitter Web App,2,19
We've reached a deal on an interim COVID-19 bill that's much better than what the Senate originally offered.  We agreed to the $250 billion for the Paycheck Protection Program but added $60 billion for smaller community banks &amp; credit unions to help truly small businesses.,2020-04-21 23:00:00,Twitter Web App,21,96
I agree 100% with the Bridgewater Council. I'm a lead sponsor of the House bill to make all municipalities eligible for relief and Democrats are pushing to get it into our next bill. Unfortunately Senate GOP leaders &amp; the White House continue to say no. https://t.co/XJU470sqqC,2020-04-21 15:14:13,Twitter Web Client,11,39
@thatgeekfromthe Hi Mustafa — call John Marshall on my team at (908)591-0635 and we’ll see if we can help.,2020-04-21 14:29:43,Twitter for iPhone,0,1
The problem is not that larger businesses got help - they employ lots of people too. The problem is that the banks let them in first while making smaller businesses wait in boarding group 6 till the $ ran out. https://t.co/FjybnK344a,2020-04-20 19:04:09,Twitter Web Client,68,169
"That’s why when the administration asked for more money we said ‘hold on a second’” Malinowski said. “House Democrats are insisting that some share of additional funding should go to community banks and smaller disadvantaged businesses." https://t.co/l9Y4z3evJL,2020-04-20 16:50:24,Twitter Web Client,10,45
I strongly agree with this letter to House leadership urging that we allow remote voting and oversight hearings when a public health crisis prevents us from operating normally in Washington. https://t.co/tbbR7nvGml,2020-04-20 16:30:23,Twitter Web App,15,79
Every mayor and county official in my district - Republican and Democrat - wants to reopen as soon as it's safe and it's insulting to suggest otherwise. They're asking for aid because they've already lost revenue and don't want to lay off cops and teachers. https://t.co/XIaBUceJfy,2020-04-19 19:03:01,Twitter Web App,25,120
Exactly right. https://t.co/chF5WptY8E,2020-04-18 18:59:53,Twitter for iPhone,15,98
The bill also requires the @HHSGov Secretary to ask the president to use the Defense Production Act to compel domestic production of the supplies should that be needed to meet the annual need.,2020-04-17 23:21:31,Twitter Web App,8,42
This way the American people will know exactly how ready the government is what the shortfalls are and whether the President &amp; Congress are acting to remedy them - before the next pandemic comes.,2020-04-17 23:17:59,Twitter Web App,12,52
Our bill would require the Secretary of @HHSGov to tell the public at the start of each year what supplies are needed to stay ready for an emergency and to ask Congress directly for $ without going through the regular budget process with all its political tradeoffs.,2020-04-17 23:17:58,Twitter Web App,8,47
Our Strategic National Stockpile of PPE has never been adequately maintained for a major pandemic. Today I introduced a bill with @Rosa_DeLauro and more than 35 co-sponsors to fix that problem going forward. https://t.co/mubDDMQ8Mg,2020-04-17 23:17:58,Twitter Web App,36,138
I led this bipartisan call on the Federal Transit Administration to ensure our rail and bus workers are better protected as they continue to carry essential employees to their jobs. https://t.co/c8g6o6Dn6v,2020-04-17 19:20:06,Twitter Web App,11,56
So far only 9% of the PPP money has gone to retail shops. Almost half the money has gone out in loans of over $1 million -- i.e. to businesses on the larger end of the qualifying scale. https://t.co/Eav9cIcT5x,2020-04-17 15:58:34,Twitter Web App,7,29
Congress gave the administration $350 billion to help small businesses first. The program needs more $ but not until we fix it so that banks don't put big chains ahead of mom and pop shops.   https://t.co/8MFFLTpH1z via @WSJ,2020-04-17 15:54:16,Twitter Web Client,25,69
Agree we must replenish the small business program. But more $ won't stop banks from favoring their biggest existing customers in a program that lumps companies w/499 employees with mom &amp; pop shops. It would make no sense to raise the limit if we don't fix this too and now! https://t.co/oncPYN901W,2020-04-16 19:16:33,Twitter Web App,18,90

We should be rallying our allies to counter Chinese influence in organizations like the WHO and fight to win instead of walking away. Instead the administration is effectively handing the WHO to China. Congress must act to reverse this.,2020-04-15 15:37:28,Twitter Web App,20,83
The WHO has partnered with us for years to fight AIDS malaria and other infectious diseases saving millions of lives. Threatening this work to create a scapegoat for our own failures is unbelievably cynical and heartless.,2020-04-15 15:37:28,Twitter Web App,19,103
I agree with the Trump administration that the World Health Organization leadership was way too soft on China's coverup of COVID-19. But it wasn't the leader of the WHO who called the pandemic a hoax or who said this. https://t.co/ypL1xCHueR,2020-04-15 15:37:28,Twitter Web App,99,279

I spoke with MSNBC's @AliVelshi and @DMiliband about our efforts to get PPE and COVID-19 testing in New Jersey - and the need for U.S. leadership globally. We can't beat this epidemic here unless we beat it everywhere. https://t.co/8U7X2TsB3Y,2020-04-13 17:54:30,Twitter Web App,32,114
We will not beat COVID-19 and we will not be able to resume normal economic life in America without widespread rapid testing. That can only happen if the federal government finally takes responsibility to create a national supply chain.,2020-04-12 20:20:04,Twitter Web App,26,103
It's crazy that our municipal and county governments must compete with each other for life-saving supplies and that we all have to figure out whether the latest guy offering PPE from China is a scam artist or for real.,2020-04-12 20:20:03,Twitter Web App,3,50
Finally: While I'm glad I was able to help in this case it's ridiculous that members of Congress have to be working the phones day after day to scrounge up masks gloves and gowns for our medical workers.,2020-04-12 20:20:03,Twitter Web App,2,25
We also desperately need new methodology with faster results. A doc told me yesterday about a symptomatic mom who can't see her just delivered baby as she waits for her result. An elderly patient waits days in the hospital since her nursing home won't take her back w/o her test.,2020-04-12 20:20:03,Twitter Web App,2,21
It makes no sense that a Plainfield resident could go to a drive through site in Union County but a North Plainfield resident living a few blocks away had no such option. The whole state and country has a stake in fixing these disparities.,2020-04-12 20:20:03,Twitter Web App,1,22
As one of my county sheriffs told me Friday drive through sites ease pressure on our hospitals since people have somewhere else to go to be tested. They allow more critical workers to rule out having the virus and thus to stay on the job.,2020-04-12 20:20:03,Twitter Web App,2,20
We urgently need more testing in this part of NJ. Somerset and Hunterdon Counties have registered over 2000 cases even with limited testing. We know the true number is much higher. I know someone who died without having been tested (thus not even counting in the daily tally).,2020-04-12 20:20:02,Twitter Web App,1,23
Good news: Somerset and Hunterdon Counties are opening a drive-through COVID-19 testing site on April 16.  I worked closely with both counties to find the PPE including N95 masks needed to finally make this happen. https://t.co/B4u026JxMQ,2020-04-12 20:20:02,Twitter Web App,33,152

I thought I'd seen the worst of voter suppression. Forcing people to risk a deadly disease to keep turnout down is a new low.   The November election cannot be postponed.

Remember: the full $1200 payment will start phasing out for single filers who made more than $75000 ($112500 for heads of household and $150000 for married couples).,2020-04-06 17:16:33,Twitter Web App,2,13

If you haven't given the IRS direct deposit information before it may be in your interest to do so by filing that 2019 return now (even though the deadline has been extended).  The IRS will also create a portal through which you can file this information by late April/early May.,2020-04-06 17:16:33,Twitter Web App,2,8
The IRS will make around 60 million payments the week of April 13th by direct deposit to those Americans for whom it has direct deposit information from their 2018 or 2019 tax returns.

Meanwhile: People are worried enough about the coronavirus. The last thing we need in a public health crisis is politicians spreading false information for partisan gain. Shame on those who are doing that.,2020-04-05 23:32:34,Twitter Web App,10,79
Our immediate challenge is to ensure New Jerseyans can swiftly benefit from the aid we've made available. My office is ready to help anyone from Phillipsburg to Mt. Olive to Flemington to Westfield get the relief they need.,2020-04-05 23:31:19,Twitter Web App,9,62
House Democrats also got $150 billion in the CARES Act for state &amp; local gov'ts. Senate Republicans insisted this money only go to municipalities w/more than 500k people. I've sponsored a bill to lower that threshold precisely to help our rural counties.,2020-04-05 23:27:44,Twitter Web App,7,40
The CARES Act also added $ for Community Development Block Grants which by law provide housing assistance to cities and urban counties. Hunterdon and Warren have never qualified for direct aid under this program but can get it passed through the state which I'm pushing for.,2020-04-05 23:27:44,Twitter Web App,8,38
I’m getting calls from folks worried by misinformation the NJ GOP put out claiming Warren &amp; Hunterdon Counties aren't getting COVID relief.

This is really important - in the absence of widespread testing our best measure of progress is reporting of flu-like symptoms.  And the good news is that counties &amp; states with tight restrictions are showing better results. #FlattenTheCurve https://t.co/bRjmtJ6SRU,2020-03-26 15:24:47,Twitter Web App,17,27

@CNj65 Last year.  I know that's not ideal.  But again most of the relief will come from other sources.,2020-03-26 01:50:06,Twitter Web App,0,2
Finally: Our economy hasn't shut down because of coronavirus. It's shut down because our nation did not (unlike S. Korea) muster widespread early testing for coronavirus. We need a public health system and leaders capable of doing better.,2020-03-26 01:31:36,Twitter Web App,21,91
But this is a much better bill because of our efforts and it won't be the final bill. For example I am pushing with Chairman @RepPeterDeFazio for an economic recovery package focusing on big investment in our nation's infrastructure.,2020-03-26 01:31:36,Twitter Web App,2,40
There were other disappointments. Among other things McConnell rejected making COVID-19 treatment free refused further expansion of paid sick and family leave and to prohibit utility shutoffs &amp; resisted stronger language on price gouging.,2020-03-26 01:31:36,Twitter Web App,5,24
We got $400 million to help states secure the November election including via vote by mail - much more than the original bill.

Every adult making under $75k ($150k for married couples) will get $1200 plus $500 for each child. That's not much but it will help. The bulk of relief comes from helping businesses keep employees on payroll &amp; unemployment insurance.,2020-03-26 01:31:35,Twitter Web App,0,23
We will help the airlines survive but much of the money  must pass straight through to their employees. They will be barred from stock buybacks or issuing dividends.,2020-03-26 01:31:35,Twitter Web App,2,37

The original bill gave the administration a slush fund to bail out big businesses with few strings attached and no requirement to even tell us which companies get the help for another six months.,2020-03-26 01:31:35,Twitter Web App,2,19
We will greatly expand and extend the duration of unemployment benefits. This will apply to self employed and gig economy workers.,2020-03-26 01:31:34,Twitter Web App,2,36
We will provide $350 billion in loans to small businesses &amp; non-profits which can be fully forgiven if they retain their employees.   Democrats won additional emergency grants - up to 10k - that small businesses can get in days to meet immediate needs.,2020-03-26 01:31:34,Twitter Web App,1,28

We'll soon pass a massive bill to bring economic relief to Americans during the epidemic.

I'm joining Reps @TimRyan and @ElissaSlotkin to introduce a bill today requiring the federal gov't to take over the Covid-19 medical supply chain.

Some folks have asked what the House &amp; Senate bills will mean for NJ.  A key difference is that the House provides much more $ for hospitals state &amp; local gov'ts and mass transit (e.g. NJ Transit).
