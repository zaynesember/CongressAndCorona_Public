(5/7) I am proud to be a co-sponsor of the #JUSTICEAct the House version of @SenatorTimScott’s legislation that would promote better #police training and #transparency in our communities.

(4/7) Rather than negotiating in good faith with the @HouseGOP the Speaker instead spent precious time passing a bill that will never become law.   That’s not leadership and that’s why I could not vote in favor of her legislation. #Americans deserve more.,2020-06-26 14:17:15,Twitter Web App,0,4
