The real enemy of state Madam Speaker is Beijing who happens to in your own words prefer @JoeBiden. https://t.co/FsWcXWgfM0,2020-08-24 23:36:31,Twitter for iPhone,10,12
The #DNC2020 this week has made clear the real #BidenHarris agenda: higher taxes more crime and less freedom. RT if you believe the Biden-Harris agenda is WRONG for America. https://t.co/CBLxTW9xcC,2020-08-20 14:33:59,Twitter Web App,6,7
Defunding the police and assaults on our 2nd Amendment are not the answer unless your goal is to have more crime of course.  https://t.co/rZ80sSU7le,2020-08-18 14:25:16,Twitter Web App,4,6
The Federal Reserve is printing unprecedented amounts of money and can now conduct its meetings in secret. That's unacceptable. I've introduced a bipartisan bill with @TulsiGabbard (D-HI) to reverse that. Americans deserve transparency and accountability. https://t.co/TEgntfkmsU,2020-08-17 16:35:52,Twitter Web App,5,7

.@JoeBiden's pick of @KamalaHarris as VP confirmed what we already knew: The Democrat ticket is wrong for America.,2020-08-14 17:31:17,Twitter Web App,0,2
Only in America can the daughter of immigrants rise to become the VP nominee of a major party. Every American can be proud of that. Nevertheless we have serious policy differences and Senator @KamalaHarris' record as an extreme liberal in the U.S. Senate cannot be ignored.,2020-08-14 17:30:32,Twitter Web App,1,6
Proud to join @krhern in introducing the Equal Opportunity 1st Amdt Act to ensure the rights of every American are evenly interpreted by local govts.

A vote for Joe Biden is a vote for the extreme left wing’s socialist agenda. Biden is NOT a middle of the road candidate; he is beholden to the Democrat Party’s most extreme fringe. https://t.co/D7L7vjJLzy,2020-07-28 20:00:49,Twitter Web App,15,26
