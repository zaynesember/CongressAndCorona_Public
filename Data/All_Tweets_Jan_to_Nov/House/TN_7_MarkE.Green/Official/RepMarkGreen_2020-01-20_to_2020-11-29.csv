The ink is barely dry on the Phase 3 relief bill and @SpeakerPelosi is floating another stimulus package. It's incredibly premature for Congress to consider additional trillion-dollar legislation when the previous aid hasn't been fully used yet.,2020-03-31 16:08:35,Hootsuite Inc.,73,232

.@SpeakerPelosi accused this President about not acting fast enough on #COVID19 but while she was passing out impeachment pens and holding up relief @POTUS:  ✅Formed Presidential coronavirus task force  ✅Quickly imposed China travel restrictions ✅Declared a nat'l emergency,2020-03-30 21:05:05,Hootsuite Inc.,66,123
.@HouseDemocrats switched directly from impeachment and grandstanding to holding up #coronavirus relief to fill the bill with partisan pork. Always about the ballot box for them.,2020-03-30 20:10:05,Hootsuite Inc.,39,121
Communist China arrested the doctors who alerted the country to #coronavirus in the first place. They covered it up. They wouldn’t allow CDC or WHO assistance. Then they blamed the virus on the U.S. military. Can we really believe they have flattened their curve?,2020-03-30 19:25:05,Hootsuite Inc.,1109,1493
$25 million of the latest #coronavirus relief bill went to line pockets at the Kennedy Center instead of making masks ventilators and PPE for our health care workers. The Kennedy Center then turned around and fired its orchestra. That’s outrageous.,2020-03-30 18:15:09,Hootsuite Inc.,526,1477

❌$1 billion “cash for clunkers” airplane program ❌$20 billion to bail out USPS ❌$200 million on fuel research ❌$35 million for the Kennedy Center  @SpeakerPelosi's legislative blackmail routine is just another page from the partisan playbook that brought us impeachment.,2020-03-24 22:35:03,Hootsuite Inc.,370,775
Today I sent a letter to @senatemajldr and @SenSchumer urging them to waive IDEA requirements in Congress' coronavirus relief legislation and give school districts more time to implement proper protocols given the extraordinary circumstances of the #COVID19 pandemic. https://t.co/wdR8Mk2tM8,2020-03-24 20:00:20,Hootsuite Inc.,14,34
.@SpeakerPelosi knows these items would never be made law unless they were tied to essential relief for American families and small businesses. That she would turn the suffering of Americans into her own extortion racket is disgusting.,2020-03-24 17:40:07,Hootsuite Inc.,248,543
.@SpeakerPelosi and @HouseDemocrats are shamelessly abusing this crisis to remake America in the image of their socialist agenda knowing full well they failed with impeachment to stifle the voice of the American people.,2020-03-24 17:30:22,Hootsuite Inc.,36,82
Of course it wouldn't be a Pelosi bill without election law meddling. She's withholding your relief in order to implement same-day voter registration and nationalize federal election rules completely undercutting voter integrity.,2020-03-24 17:20:06,Hootsuite Inc.,67,113
Small businesses would be put on their death beds with Speaker Pelosi's version of coronavirus relief. Instead of passing the Senate cure @SpeakerPelosi is holding small biz hostage in order to sneak in numerous liberal riders at a time when Americans are hurting. Shameful.,2020-03-24 17:10:08,Hootsuite Inc.,42,95
Instead of coming to the table to work on a bill both Democrats and Republicans negotiated in the Senate @SpeakerPelosi is playing games – and time is running out. Madam Speaker it's time to quit playing politics and come together for the American people.,2020-03-24 16:20:10,Hootsuite Inc.,257,747
The midst of a pandemic is not the time for pet projects but it's not surprising the Speaker is continuing to follow Rahm Emanuel's "Never let a crisis go to waste" playbook.,2020-03-24 15:25:07,Hootsuite Inc.,73,182

Minimum wage student loan debt and postal reform are serious issues that need to be debated – not stuck into the #coronavirus relief bill @SpeakerPelosi. It does no one – on either side of the debate – any good to do this.,2020-03-24 14:40:07,Hootsuite Inc.,54,170
Can someone explain to me how exactly does a $1 billion "cash for clunkers" airplane program help defeat coronavirus and put Americans back on their feet? Anyone? cc: @RepAOC @SenSanders,2020-03-24 14:25:07,Hootsuite Inc.,53,136
The Senate bill helps modernize healthcare for a time as this – by expanding telehealth access for home dialysis patients hospice and home health patients. Why does Speaker Pelosi's bill include provisions of the Green New Deal but not this?,2020-03-24 14:15:15,Hootsuite Inc.,40,98
The Senate bill is not perfect but at least it's relevant to addressing the coronavirus pandemic and getting Americans back on their feet. Pelosi's bill? It's loaded with radical leftwing programs that even many Democrats are skeptical of.,2020-03-24 12:15:13,Hootsuite Inc.,234,584

The same Democrats that gave us the impeachment sham no one wanted are now holding up job relief with their liberal pet projects. This is pathetic.,2020-03-24 01:55:02,Hootsuite Inc.,66,147

Just a reminder that @RepAdamSchiff read a fake transcript of President Trump’s call with President Zelensky on national television because the real transcript wasn’t condemning.   This is more than a charade—it’s unjust and it should have ended months ago.,2020-02-03 19:45:09,Hootsuite Inc.,620,1770
For the framers of the Constitution #impeachment was meant to be grave. But Democrats are using it as a remedy for a lost election overturning the voices of tens of millions of voters in the process.,2020-02-03 18:10:13,Hootsuite Inc.,128,356

.@SpeakerPelosi has said outright “We cannot accept a second term for Donald Trump if we are going to be faithful to our democracy and to the Constitution of the United States.” Ironically her impeachment on party lines does exactly that: it’s unfaithful to our Constitution.,2020-01-31 18:45:12,Hootsuite Inc.,522,1378

“Treason Bribery or other high Crimes or misdemeanors.” That’s the bar the Founders set for impeachment.   Not baseless claims of abused power.  Not "obstruction of Congress."   In their attempt to overturn the 2016 election @HouseDemocrats have cheapened this whole process.,2020-01-31 14:35:10,Hootsuite Inc.,89,236
Remember when nearly 70 Congressional Dems boycotted Trump’s inauguration citing their refusal to accept @realDonaldTrump as legitimate president? Still convinced this impeachment is anything more than a partisan charade?  https://t.co/CRkOtWrtKJ,2020-01-31 01:05:05,Hootsuite Inc.,1669,2740

.@SpeakerPelosi has admitted her real reason for impeaching @realDonaldTrump: “10 months from now we will have an election if we don’t have him removed sooner.”   This was never about justice. It was always about overturning results they didn’t like.,2020-01-29 15:05:18,Hootsuite Inc.,362,989
.@realDonaldTrump's defense team has done a fantastic job. The left is acknowledging that they've laid out the facts in the President’s favor → it’s because the facts are in the President’s favor.

This entire impeachment process has been tainted by the fact that @RepAdamSchiff—a fact witness who colluded with the whistleblower and then tried to cover up his involvement— supervised it.

You want to talk about “abuse of power”? @HouseDemocrats won’t trust the American people with the results of the next election. @AOC even admitted this impeachment is about "preventing a potentially disastrous outcome from occurring” in 2020. Shameful.,2020-01-28 15:35:08,Hootsuite Inc.,205,493
Last week was all sanctimonious grandstanding—House Democrats repeating the same debunked claims over &amp; over.

This impeachment attack on @realDonaldTrump is an attack on the American people and their fundamental right to vote. 9 months to the next election and Dems are still attempting to undo the last one.

All the Dem #ImpeachmentManagers have done this week is rehash their failed arguments from the House.   The fact that they want more witnesses &amp; more time just shows they don't have anything. They have no evidence of a crime in fact they have no accusation of a crime. https://t.co/qI7UI2Ieoe,2020-01-25 19:25:12,Hootsuite Inc.,376,1206
.@HouseDemocrats didn't nail down exactly why they're impeaching this President and now they're finding out that proving a case using law and facts is much harder than concocting charges and ramming them through with focus groups and a partisan majority.,2020-01-25 16:30:25,Hootsuite Inc.,85,296
