The nurses doctors front-line workers and American people deserve leaders that rise to meet the challenges we face not dodge responsibility.

Our singular focus should be on what we have to do here in the U.S. to suppress the virus and protect Americans. Some of my Republican colleagues seem only interested in focusing on China. This is shirking responsibility. This is failing to rise to the challenge. 10/,2020-07-27 15:19:11,Twitter Web App,5,52
It simply does not have to be this way. Where is the outcry from Republicans to fix this? Why does the Republican leadership refuse to urge the Trump Administration to change course?

Meanwhile health care and front-line workers don’t have the equipment they need to keep them safe. Turnaround time for testing has stretched more than 10 days in many places across the country rendering it practically useless. 8/,2020-07-27 15:19:11,Twitter Web App,3,49
We need a consistent public message campaign on masks &amp; social distancing but we have yet to see that from POTUS or GOP leadership.

The reason we can’t reopen? Because over six months into this crisis we still don’t have adequate PPE or testing let alone a coherent national strategy.   We can combat this virus but we are actively choosing not to. That has got to change. 6/,2020-07-27 15:19:10,Twitter Web App,13,71

President Trump who refuses to deliver a health &amp; science-based message to the public must be held accountable. Yet it seems all some Republicans want to do to solve this crisis is to only blame China instead of their own shortcomings – that’s an abject failure of leadership. 3,2020-07-27 15:19:10,Twitter Web App,9,69
China’s willful negligence and failure to be transparent aren’t responsible for the absence of national leadership in the US like Republicans would like you to believe. Trump is responsible for our woefully insufficient testing system or the lack of PPE across the country. 2/,2020-07-27 15:19:10,Twitter Web App,16,86
It appears many Republicans want to distract from the US failure to address #COVID19 &amp; they are using China to do so.

It is un-American to use our service members to ‘dominate’ civilians as both the President and Secretary of Defense have suggested. We live in a democracy not a dictatorship. I urge President Trump to reverse course and calm tensions across the country not escalate them.,2020-06-02 00:40:14,Twitter Web App,339,881
Instead he has decided to rely on the use of force to address those who he views as a threat. Rather than trying to calm tensions in the wake of the murder of George Floyd Trump has used inflammatory rhetoric inciting violence against fellow Americans who are protesting.,2020-06-02 00:40:13,Twitter Web App,31,97
As we battle two pandemics at once – #COVID19 virus and the scourge of racism – President Trump’s decision to invoke the Insurrection Act and his inflammatory rhetoric proves that he cannot lead us through these tumultuous times and unite the country. https://t.co/3EX1E6rioH,2020-06-02 00:40:13,Twitter Web App,88,197

In the coming months and years a lot of attention will be given to questions around how the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded and how we prevent and better mitigate future outbreaks. We must use this opportunity to reinforce the value of U.S. global leadership. #USGlobalResponse (7/8),2020-04-28 20:12:16,Twitter Web App,3,3
Efforts to cut these programs and gut key agencies such as @USAID the @StateDept and the @CDCgov are short-sighted and harm the long-term health and economic wellbeing of the U.S. #USGlobalResponse (6/8),2020-04-28 20:12:16,Twitter Web App,2,4
