There shouldn’t be any debate: if parents want to send their children to in-person instruction they should have opportunities and choices to do so. By subjecting our children to virtual instruction ONLY we are failing them. https://t.co/VfROZc1c45,2020-11-11 02:38:47,Twitter for iPhone,141,687

What many in the mainstream media &amp; the radical left have no interest in showing Americans about COVID-19 - while "cases" are up deaths (w/ or from COVID) remain very low in comparison.

COVID-19 COMMON SENSE -   ➡️ If you get tested for COVID-19  90% of Arizona tests come back NEGATIVE.  ➡️ If your COVID-19 test comes back POSITIVE there is a very good possibility that your result was NON-INFECTIOUS or a FALSE POSITIVE due to the sensitivity of the test. https://t.co/MzV6mxuGTN,2020-11-10 19:04:25,TweetDeck,101,325

Why is it important that we provide context behind the reported COVID-19 numbers in AZ?  Because in our state we believe that ARIZONANS decide their own destiny &amp; have the freedom to make our own decisions about how we live &amp; go about our lives.  NOT bureaucrats or the media.,2020-11-06 15:48:16,TweetDeck,370,1247
Few in the media are also demanding that Arizona health officials provide a breakdown of the seriousness of the reported cases.  How many cases are serious?  How many cases are mild?  How many cases are asymptomatic?   These numbers are important to provide context for Arizona.,2020-11-06 15:45:50,TweetDeck,52,244
No one knows the sensitivity of the PCR tests  Here's why that is important:  MONTHS AGO a NEW YORK TIMES piece found that in 3 states 90% of cases may have been non-infectious/false positives.  Few in the ARIZONA media have asked AZDHS about our test sensitivity numbers.,2020-11-06 15:40:57,TweetDeck,57,176
No context to these COVID-19 numbers.  The mainstream media refuses to hold Arizona health officials accountable to providing the context that is required for a rational response to this virus.

There’s no context to your numbers. You have absolutely no interest in finding out the cycle threshold for the tests.

FACT: there were over 2000 COVID-19 cases reported in Arizona but most in the mainstream media haven’t bothered to lift a finger to find out the cycle threshold (sensitivity) for Arizona’s PCR tests.

Arizona is one of the most restrictive states in the nation when it comes to COVID-19 mandates - not to mention that many families still don’t have the choices to send their children back to in-person school.

90% of Arizona’s COVID-19 reported positive PCR results could be non-infectious/false positives if our cycle threshold (sensitivity) is anything like other states.  Arizonans deserve the truth &amp; full transparency about these tests &amp; results. We need to know the cycle threshold. https://t.co/r0xihISZrF,2020-09-16 02:14:58,Twitter for iPhone,206,425

Dr Fauci has been doing enough "briefing" to the press over the past 2 months. President @realDonaldTrump knows exactly what the doctor thinks based on reading a myriad of news reports w/ Fauci quotes.  Dr Fauci and Dr Birx have done enough damage to the U.S. society &amp; economy. https://t.co/M1haMGFCZS,2020-07-10 18:11:59,TweetDeck,1239,2608

COVID-19 is serious - especially for our older population. Yet we know much more now about how to protect our most vulnerable from COVID-19. Arizonans are smart &amp; resourceful. We don't need more one-size-fits-all gov't mandates that the media attempts to coerce on a daily basis.,2020-07-10 15:51:06,TweetDeck,81,244
Arizonans don't just have to deal with the heat of the Arizona sunshine this summer; we have to fend off the heat from the mainstream Arizona media and the radical left trying to force another societal and economic shutdown upon our state. https://t.co/BE56Z5rXwD,2020-07-10 15:50:14,TweetDeck,363,883
Earlier today members of the @freedomcaucus held a press conference in D.C. to support President @realDonaldTrump's &amp; @BetsyDeVosED's efforts to reopen America's schools.

More testing ➡️ More cases detected ➡️ lower hospitalization rate ➡️ lower mortality rate.  This is what you need to know about Arizona's current COVID-19 situation.   The mainstream media is not interested in giving you the proper context and perspective. https://t.co/faMNDR181s,2020-07-09 22:02:00,TweetDeck,421,796
No excuse for this not to apply to Arizona. Arizonans deserve and demand freedom. We don’t take our marching orders from New York. https://t.co/Vej3B2QGFL,2020-07-09 21:21:09,Twitter for iPhone,535,1459
Secretary @BetsyDeVosED can't win...  - Attacked when promoting a policy of giving parents choice and freedom of where they believe it's best to send their children to school.  - Attacked when promoting the policy of just sending children to school - even public schools. https://t.co/d9EEAkHD4W,2020-07-09 19:43:50,TweetDeck,66,204

Dr Fauci and Dr Birx must not be allowed to continue imposing their doctrine of destruction across our nation. They must be shown the door - immediately.   There are lives being devestated and depressed due to lockdowns and schools shutting down in-person instruction. No more! https://t.co/1XU1NGt488,2020-07-09 16:04:37,Twitter for iPhone,653,1272

Maybe instead of creating more hysteria in Arizona the NYT should ask more questions about why New York's and New Jersey's COVID-19 death rate are still the highest in the nation.  ➡️ NJ: 170.9 deaths/100k pop. ➡️ NY: 164.9 deaths/100k pop. ➡️ Arizona: 25.5 deaths/100k pop.,2020-07-09 02:58:55,TweetDeck,199,431
Conveniently the NYT left out the fact that Arizona's hospitalization and mortality rates have plummeted with all of the testing our state has done over the past month.,2020-07-09 02:58:05,TweetDeck,100,302
The NYT left out context to put these numbers into proper perspective.   ➡️ Over the past 7 days Brazil has been doing 0025 tests/100k pop. ➡️ Yesterday AZ did 12212 tests = 167.7 tests/100k pop.  ➡️ Brazil has done 1435 tests/100k pop. ➡️ AZ has done 8615 tests/100k pop.,2020-07-09 02:57:36,TweetDeck,46,132
