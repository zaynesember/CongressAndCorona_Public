This agreement is a win for the US economy &amp; a new standard for US trade agreements.,2020-01-29 23:04:04,Twitter for iPhone,8,14

When Pres. Trump &amp; GOP passed their #GOPTaxScam they promised increased tax revenues to offset the massive debt they created. These revenues never materialized.

The 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau is a moment to reflect on the millions of European victims &amp; survivors of the Holocaust.

It was great to visit @BooksforAfrica at its new St. Paul warehouse where they ship books to all 55 countries on the African continent.
