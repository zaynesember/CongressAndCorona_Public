THERE SHE GOES AGAIN: With over 200 thousand lives lost in the USA @claudiatenney has resorted to conspiracy theories about coronavirus.  I challenge Ms. Tenney to do more than delete tin foil hat tweets after she’s been caught.  She MUST acknowledge the lives lost—some local. https://t.co/Y5cejcdSnD,2020-10-05 13:36:06,Twitter Web App,64,220
@EliseStefanik I think you’d find @lukeradel to be a fair and professional journalist. Maybe you can give an interview to him instead of being an accomplice to the stonewalling by the Tenney campaign!,2020-10-05 00:22:47,Twitter for iPhone,13,69

ICYMI I wrote an op-ed blowing the whistle on Spectrum’s plan to cap your Internet data. Their greed is unacceptable even more so during the coronavirus crisis when so many have had to cut back. #NY22 we must fight this.  https://t.co/GkiMHrbZvD,2020-08-16 20:39:40,Twitter for iPhone,10,22
Our #NY22 farmers are the backbone of our country’s economy and food security. Like so many of our small businesses and workers they have been greatly hurt by the coronavirus pandemic.

The story is clear: After Tenney took Spectrum’s campaign contributions she cut their taxes by $9 billion. Spectrum then wrote her another $5000 check. She sold you out and it’s no wonder Spectrum wants her back.,2020-08-14 17:03:40,Twitter Web App,14,54

This is the strategy I used to get four laws signed by President Trump. If I can pass the SPOONSS Act get President Trump to sign it AND help our area workforce well then I can put a fork in Spectrum’s price gouging too.,2020-08-12 15:44:33,Twitter Web App,3,14

I find renewed energy every time you cheer me on to keep the fight going and read each and every one of your letters on this issue. And most importantly I share your points in Congressional hearings.,2020-08-12 15:43:26,Twitter Web App,0,4
And on February 10 I demanded the NYS Public Service Commission (PSC) investigate Spectrum for widespread outages. The PSC announced their investigation just three days later and Spectrum was later forced to give customers a bill credit.,2020-08-12 15:43:00,Twitter Web App,1,10
On January 8 I publicized shady debt collection practices by Spectrum’s collection company Credit Management LP forcing that firm to back off locals and I have a pending request with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to deal with this issue.,2020-08-12 15:42:34,Twitter Web App,1,8
My very first bill in Congress (2019) the bipartisan Transparency for Cable Consumers Act finally put Spectrum on the defense.,2020-08-12 15:42:09,Twitter Web App,2,5

If the FCC were to allow Spectrum out of its promise by allowing data caps kids and teachers would face slow or no internet at all and we will all face bigger bills.,2020-08-12 15:41:17,Twitter Web App,3,6
This year’s number one back-to-school supply is the internet itself. Many local parents — and their kids — will require the internet this fall as part of schooling amid COVID-19.,2020-08-12 15:40:45,Twitter Web App,0,5

1. Claudia Tenney took Spectrum’s corporate money 🤑  2. Then she cut their taxes by $9 billion 💰  It’s no secret why Spectrum wants their Congresswoman back.   #NY22 we won’t be fooled! https://t.co/sD2zkc7aTz,2020-08-11 13:19:24,Twitter Web App,55,136

Happy #NationalSiblingsDay! Love you guys! I'd like to give a special shoutout to my sister Rosie (in the middle!) a Nurse Practitioner in Infectious Disease who is helping us all through this fight. https://t.co/nwDi5Tuojn,2020-04-10 20:36:39,Twitter for iPhone,2,35
It is increasingly important that we as a country reduce our reliance on China. And this year with the signature of @realDonaldTrump on the #SPOONSSAct we are leading the way here in #NY22 https://t.co/lYTMjcJbyk,2020-04-10 17:48:44,Twitter for iPhone,1,2
For all who observe have a peaceful and blessed #GoodFriday https://t.co/lX9GSAOQJ1,2020-04-10 15:49:06,Twitter Web App,6,18
I've said it before and I'll say it again: we cannot rely on China for emergency supplies.   That's why I led a group of Ds and Rs to introduce the Made In America Emergency Preparedness Act to better prepare our country for national emergencies. https://t.co/D36YAokujB,2020-04-09 23:33:18,Twitter for iPhone,2,26
Stories like this are one of the many reasons I am so proud to represent Upstate New York. We are a family and we have each other's backs. #NY22  https://t.co/HINEdVQPxY,2020-04-09 19:48:58,Twitter for iPhone,2,11
We must all heed the advice to stay home but it’s important to remember those who don’t have that option.   I am proud to have delivered 1.5M in Utica and 1.1M in Binghamton in federal grant funding to fight homelessness during the pandemic.  https://t.co/yzl0BBuPko,2020-04-08 21:59:29,Twitter for iPhone,6,18
Happy #Passover  to all who celebrate! Even though this year’s celebrations may be different than in the past they carry the same meaning of hope and freedom. Chag Sameach! https://t.co/pAEJs12i69,2020-04-08 15:02:42,Twitter Web App,7,33
Why are supplies from China needed in a coronavirus fight? I’m determined to change that.  I introduced the "Made In America Emergency Preparedness Act" to strengthen our supply chain so we aren't over-reliant on China and other countries to help us.  https://t.co/YNtIs6jc1k,2020-04-04 00:29:21,Twitter for iPhone,13,73

Today on #EqualPayDay take a moment to recognize the women on the frontlines showing up and saving lives.  EMTs nurses members of the military doctors grocery store workers and many more.  You are the backbone of our community.  And you should be paid equally. Full stop.,2020-03-31 18:45:21,Twitter for iPhone,4,36
On this #VietnamWarVeteransDay take a moment to honor Vietnam Veterans for their service to our Nation many of whom did not receive the recognition they deserved upon arriving home. We are grateful for your service and sacrifice.,2020-03-29 22:41:44,Twitter Web App,7,29

Today we put politics aside to fight back against COVID-19 passing a bill in the House that provides:  ✅ Direct payments to hardworking Americans ✅ Relief for small businesses ✅ Access to health care services and broadband in rural areas  https://t.co/0hBpdcMdm8,2020-03-27 19:28:39,Twitter for iPhone,3,22
Upstate NY is home to some of the best small businesses in the country but they’re hurting from recent COVID-19 safety measures.  If you or someone you know owns a small business check out the relief programs available: https://t.co/ylPRZMbw4W,2020-03-25 23:23:18,Twitter for iPhone,6,22

@IanPickus @WAMCNews Fact: New York received $6.7 billion in Families First Coronavirus Act ($5.26 billion directly to state remainder to counties &amp; NYC).

Our country is in the midst of an unprecedented public health crisis. The idea that anyone let alone a sitting U.S. Senator would attempt to use their position of power to try and profit off of that is wrong. https://t.co/QdP7owiQ2L,2020-03-20 15:35:32,Twitter for iPhone,6,42
Please reach out if there is anything I can do to support you or your family. We are in this together.,2020-03-19 21:14:48,Twitter Web App,1,11
I’m calling on President Trump to declare NY state a disaster area freeing up more federal money and resources to fight Coronavirus. I joined 14 members of Congress in sending a bi-partisan letter to the President emphasizing New York’s need for immediate help with COVID-19.,2020-03-19 21:14:11,Twitter Web App,4,22
Last night President Trump signed into law our Families First Coronavirus Response Act bringing $33.7 million in emergency funding to our district. This is a big step in the right direction. There is so much more work left to do.,2020-03-19 21:12:05,Twitter Web App,0,6

I know and work with @EliseStefanik and she doesn’t deserve this treatment. Hatred has no home in political discourse. Policy disagreements are par for the course. Vile attacks like she received detract from the issues at hand.,2020-03-08 14:20:14,Twitter for iPhone,6,34
