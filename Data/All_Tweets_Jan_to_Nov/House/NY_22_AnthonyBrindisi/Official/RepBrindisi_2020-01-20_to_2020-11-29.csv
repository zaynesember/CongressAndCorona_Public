I will always put #NY22 &amp; our country first. That is more important now than ever before.  Is this legislation perfect? No. But our communities have been knocked down by this crisis &amp; need a helping hand to get back up.  I’ll never stop fighting for Upstate in Congress. 13/,2020-05-15 20:22:52,Twitter Web App,6,16
This pandemic dealt a serious blow to the US Postal Service so the #HeroesAct gives @USPS $25B to get back on track.  There are millions more dollars allocated for strict oversight of all coronavirus relief funds to ensure they go to the workers &amp; families who need them. 12/,2020-05-15 20:22:52,Twitter Web App,4,14
AND this legislation will lower cable bills by up to $50/month for households that are low-income or affected by furloughs or layoffs.  This takes money out of the pockets of multi-million dollar corporations &amp; puts it back in the hands of the Americans who need it most. 11/,2020-05-15 20:22:52,Twitter Web App,2,5
Access to the internet is more vital than ever.  The #HeroesAct includes more than $15B to expand affordable broadband access and get our rural communities online.  It will ensure big cable companies can’t raise their prices during this crisis.  10/,2020-05-15 20:22:51,Twitter Web App,2,5
This virus takes a toll on our mental health too &amp; this legislation provides counseling for all servicemembers who deployed on active duty service to fight #COVID19.  It also ensures the VA covers COVID treatment for all our Veterans even at non-VA facilities. 9/,2020-05-15 20:22:51,Twitter Web App,2,5
Our Upstate dairy farmers are suffering right now &amp; the #HeroesAct provides more than $16B in direct payments to ag producers to cover losses &amp; compensate for milk-dumping.  It would also help connect family farmers to food banks &amp; prevent needless hunger across the country. 8/,2020-05-15 20:22:51,Twitter Web App,2,7
I fought to include my bipartisan ARC Act in this bill to ensure that hospitals in rural districts like #NY22 can afford to keep their doors open through this pandemic.  All Americans must have access to health care regardless of where they live. 7/,2020-05-15 20:22:50,Twitter Web App,3,7
Our small businesses are the heart &amp; soul of our communities. The #HeroesAct will:  - Increase flexibility for PPP loans - Provide $10 billion in grants for local businesses - Extend emergency paid sick leave to businesses with less than 500 employees. 6/,2020-05-15 20:22:50,Twitter Web App,3,5
This legislation provides desperately needed funding for state &amp; local governments.  Without this funding NYS will be forced to make cuts to essential services like schools police &amp; fire departments and hospitals.   We can’t let that happen. 5/,2020-05-15 20:22:50,Twitter Web App,3,7
The #HeroesAct creates a $200B Heroes Fund to give hazard pay to all our essential workers who have risked their lives every single day of this crisis to keep us safe &amp; healthy.  It provides another round of $1200 payments to individuals including $500 for ALL dependents. 4/,2020-05-15 20:22:50,Twitter Web App,2,6
This legislation provides $75B for #COVID19 testing &amp; contact tracing &amp; requires all health insurers (public &amp; private) to cover 100% of COVID treatments.  It also expands health care options for those who lost their jobs due to the pandemic. 3/,2020-05-15 20:22:49,Twitter Web App,3,6
Our economy is struggling. Countless businesses have closed kids are out of school &amp; hard working families have lost their paychecks.  I know Upstate NY is tough but right now we need resources.  The #HeroesAct is far from perfect but it will give NY the help we need. 2/,2020-05-15 20:22:49,Twitter Web App,4,7
NYS has been the hardest hit in the country by #COVID19. We’ve seen nearly 350000 cases and nearly 2000 in #NY22 alone.   More than 20000 New Yorkers have lost their lives to this horrible virus.
