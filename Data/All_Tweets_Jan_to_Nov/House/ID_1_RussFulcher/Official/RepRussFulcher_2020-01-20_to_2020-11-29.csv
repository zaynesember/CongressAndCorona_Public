HR6800 may pass through the democrat-controlled House but it is clear that this one-sided bill will not pass the Senate or be signed by @realDonaldTrump. Despite this we cannot ignore the costly &amp; unconstitutional parameters this proposal is setting for future negotiations.,2020-05-14 22:55:09,Twitter Web App,6,22
For these reasons and the echo of similar concerns from my constituents in ID01 I plan to vote NO on this legislation.,2020-05-14 22:55:09,Twitter Web App,2,21
Additionally the ‘HEROES’ Act would infringe upon states’ Constitutional rights to determine the “time place and manner of holding elections” by federalizing the elections process. States would not have the option to require voter ID &amp; national vote by mail would be enacted.,2020-05-14 22:55:09,Twitter Web App,0,6
Examples of Unrelated Provisions in 'HEROES' Act: • Individual Economic Impact Payments &amp; Medicaid coverage to illegal immigrants • $50M EPA funding for ‘environmental justice grants' • $20M funding for Nat'l Endowments for Arts &amp; Humanities • Bailout for labor union pensions,2020-05-14 22:55:08,Twitter Web App,0,3
The bill contains many items that are unrelated to COVID-19 or are progressive policy wishes rather than solely emergency provisions to support Americans through this period.,2020-05-14 22:55:08,Twitter Web App,0,3
Keep in mind WITHOUT passage of Pelosi’s new bill CBO has already projected this fiscal year's federal budget deficit to be $3.7 trillion and our debt-to-GDP ratio to be as high as it was during WWII (federal debt held by public reaching 101% of GDP). https://t.co/TcsbsDGy9Q,2020-05-14 22:55:08,Twitter Web App,1,5
Pelosi's HEROES' Act is reported to cost $3 trillion. To put this in perspective the price tag of this bill is nearly double that of the recently passed CARES Act which was the most expensive piece of legislation ever enacted.,2020-05-14 22:55:08,Twitter Web App,1,6
Tomorrow the House is voting on Speaker Pelosi’s 1800+ page ‘HEROES’ Act that we received two days ago despite calls from both democrats and republicans to delay this vote.,2020-05-14 22:55:08,Twitter Web App,5,21
