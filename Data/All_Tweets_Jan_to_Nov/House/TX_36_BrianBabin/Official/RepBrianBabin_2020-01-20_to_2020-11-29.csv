If you wonder why Congress can’t get much done - it’s because of this kind of divisive &amp; hateful rhetoric spoken by none other than the House Speaker.

.@RepAOC &amp; 40+ Dems have proposed one of the most radical bills I’ve ever read. The #NewWayForwardAct will create a new immigration system that solely protects CRIMINAL illegal aliens – granting them total impunity.

Adam Schiff's Impeachment Timeline:   1. Claims case is "infallible" 2. Begs for more evidence/witnesses to make case 3. Doesn't get more evidence/witnesses 4.

To be clear:   1. House D's raced to pass impeachment articles at historic pace claiming it was a "natl emergency."  2. @SpeakerPelosi sat w/ "urgent" articles for 33 days before sending to the Senate.  3. They want the Senate to dig deeper into the case they deemed "infallible." https://t.co/QIecBgZh6X,2020-01-30 21:41:37,Twitter Media Studio,66,100

For 100 yrs the House Majority granted the Minority one chance to intro an amendment of their own &amp; force a vote on it.  Until now.
