I believe in finishing what you started and that's exactly what I plan to do if re-elected. I will continue to work with President @realDonaldTrump on keeping America Great! #KAG2020 #TX36 https://t.co/HWz8zvIjAf,2020-01-25 18:00:01,Buffer,21,20
The idea of a Dem Pres. &amp; majority in Congress is becoming increasingly dangerous - especially for Texans. Dems’ promises to abolish the fracking and shale revolution would destroy not only jobs in #TX36 but also the economy of Texas and many others. https://t.co/IblFSTtAQ5,2020-01-24 22:36:13,Twitter Web App,4,5
On #MarchforLifeDay we join the fight to protect the lives of the unborn. I will continue to fight for this today and every day! #prolife https://t.co/IKAs1X6rND,2020-01-24 17:01:03,Buffer,2,5
If TX turns blue like VA our Second Amendment rights will be under attack even more than they already are. We can't let this happen - sign our official petition if you support the #2A and want to #KeepTexasRed --&gt; https://t.co/JAiCjB5ltE https://t.co/uV8VKZ8rEW,2020-01-24 00:10:03,Buffer,1,4
President @realDonaldTrump continues to be a champion for #prolife values as he will be the first president in history to attend and address @March_for_Life in person. President Trump is making America great again. https://t.co/KmRpWri8Da,2020-01-23 15:37:22,Twitter Web App,2,3
Our Second Amendment rights are under attack but like @realDonaldTrump I will always fight to protect #2A! Retweet if you agree #TX36 https://t.co/4aSGIqyL9Y,2020-01-21 22:57:00,Twitter Web App,11,21
