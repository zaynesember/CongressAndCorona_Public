Gov Hogan's Nov election "plan" falls short. He's making it harder for MDers to vote by mail and forcing counties to conduct "normal" in-person voting without enough safe locations or PPE for election workers.

Honoring treasonous leaders displaying their flag and other racist symbology have no place in our military. It weakens morale and undermines our values.

Communities of color are confronting tragic losses from coronavirus &amp; daily injustices at work in school or by the police.

President Trump has debased and tarnished the office of the presidency many times over his term. His actions inflaming tensions today are a new low.

For weeks we've called on Hogan to provide transparency on tests. Now as MD rushes toward reopening officials acknowledge that they don't have "enough" and are "struggling."

Hogan did a PR tour around these overpriced incomplete tests while MDers faced delays &amp; half-truths. Counties gave up &amp; bought their own.

Maryland consistently ranks as one of the highest positive infection rates in the country indicating that MD is not testing beyond the sickest patients and has limited data on broader community spread.   We are failing by every benchmark. https://t.co/s4W5cu2Bg8,2020-05-18 21:25:57,Twitter Web App,2,8
In the past week Maryland averaged 5247 daily tests - far fewer than both Gov. Hogan’s 10000 daily test target and Harvard’s suggested 28000 tests per day.  The rush to reopen Maryland without adequate testing leaves our communities vulnerable to infection and risks lives. https://t.co/azJOvgYlCq,2020-05-18 21:25:57,Twitter Web App,4,12
200K tests is a milestone we shouldn't be celebrating. Two months in we're not testing nearly enough. Counties can't open because they still don't have enough promised supplies or PPE.

We cannot end the terrible pain of losing a child but we can work to deliver justice. https://t.co/tx8TzGYKSg,2020-02-12 17:57:14,Twitter Web App,7,11
700000 Washingtonians still do not have a vote in Congress. DC residents serve in the military they are veterans teachers nurses and pastors - but above all they are American citizens.   It’s time we secure equal rights for all of our citizens. It’s time for #DCstatehood. https://t.co/I9uVhNJwAr,2020-02-11 16:27:04,Twitter Web App,5,23
63000 people use the Baltimore-Washington Parkway to get to work and school every day often facing unsafe road conditions.  My legislation would work to fix that directing the government to prioritize high traffic roads. That's how we get Maryland #MovingForward #ForThePeople https://t.co/QU3U3zqZaL,2020-02-10 21:45:00,Twitter Media Studio,2,18
National security isn’t just our military. It’s our economy our environment our healthcare and development projects  Trump’s cuts to Medicare Medicaid SNAP CHIP foreign aid and environmental programs undercuts our strength leaving us with a less stable more perilous world. https://t.co/Fr6mNUzQmy,2020-02-10 19:29:48,Twitter Web App,11,19
During Gun Violence Survivors Week we remember the immense physical and emotional trauma survivors live with each day. Those scars linger.  Mitch McConnell could bring legislation to #EndGunViolence for a vote today. Instead he sides with the gun lobby over victims. https://t.co/LxQbteNChh,2020-02-07 18:09:00,Twitter Web App,5,16
When we empower working people to stand together and form unions they secure bigger paychecks better benefits and safer working conditions.   Today House Democrats passed the #PROAct to do just that and create an economy where everyone can succeed. https://t.co/nb9qTAg2QX,2020-02-06 21:17:00,TweetDeck,4,12
Trump is attempting to cut Medicaid threatening medical services and coverage for our most vulnerable citizens. Just another broken promise from Trump whose only health care plan is to kick people off theirs.

More lanes and asphalt won’t solve our region’s traffic problems. We need 21st century thinking that better facilitates the lives of working families through better public transit and walkable communities.   That’s how we get MD DC and VA #MovingFoward   https://t.co/38UodpQZz2,2020-02-06 00:05:00,TweetDeck,4,11
Trump was impeached for leveraging military aid for his own political gain and then attempting to cover it up. A bipartisan group of Senators recognizes the dangerous implications of these actions.  To not remove this president threatens our national security and the rule of law. https://t.co/ZPtxucYT3R,2020-02-05 22:34:42,Twitter Web App,7,18
The Chesapeake Bay is central to Maryland’s economy environmental health and culture.

Trump just delivered a speech full of lies distortions and false promises to the American people. He stoked divisions rather than addressing the issues keeping working families up at night.

Trump’s record on Iran is a disaster. His reckless escalations have put Iran back on the path toward a nuclear weapon endangered our troops and allies and further destabilized the region.  America must lead but under this president we're isolated and left behind #SOTU,2020-02-05 03:20:00,Twitter Web App,5,26
If Trump is truly committed to reducing the cost of prescription drugs he would ask Mitch McConnell to vote on our legislation which would save Americans over $600 billion.

At #SOTU Trump won’t talk about his plan to end protections for people with preexisting conditions kick the sick and vulnerable off their healthcare plans or his refusal to take up bills to lower Rx drug costs  We need a president who actually cares about the #StateOfHealthCare https://t.co/CHPyuj9dBP,2020-02-04 20:38:00,Twitter Web App,4,7

Proud to see Maryland WWII veteran and Tuskegee Airman Charles McGee take part in the #SuperBowlLIV coin toss.

I served in Iraq and have seen the sacrifices we’ve made in the Middle East. The House’s action to #StopEndlessWar recognizes the realities on the ground and the voice of the people in matters of war and peace.    Congress owes it to our troops to fulfill its Constitutional duty. https://t.co/C344n7Mtiy,2020-01-31 16:11:39,Twitter Media Studio,32,95
Every Marylander who completes their sentence should be full citizens with the opportunity to attain gainful employment. Banning the box on employment applications ends a discriminatory practice that hurts our economy and communities. It ensures fairness and a more just society. https://t.co/bolstMASyf,2020-01-30 21:37:00,Twitter Web App,6,19
Trump can call his Medicaid cuts whatever he wants. Americans are not fooled. We have decades of receipts showing Republican attempts to take away health care from the vulnerable sick and disabled.

1 year ago Trump instituted the #RemainInMexico policy which has stranded asylum seekers children and families in unsafe and potentially deadly conditions.

Killing of #WilliamGreen was an indefensible crime and tragedy. There is no reason why a handcuffed person should have been shot 7 times. Justice must be done.

Hearing from witnesses who have direct knowledge of Trump’s politically motivated freeze on Ukrainian military aid is not a partisan issue. Key figures in Trump’s national security orbit are speaking out.   Are Senators willing to really listen? https://t.co/Padl6eoOpl,2020-01-28 19:36:34,Twitter Web App,4,16

Trump’s own National Security Adviser confirms the President personally held up Ukrainian military aid until he got his partisan investigations. To not allow witnesses to come forward during the impeachment trial would be a miscarriage of justice.  The truth must come out. https://t.co/Obg9LIBN0o,2020-01-27 18:56:06,Twitter Web App,16,48
