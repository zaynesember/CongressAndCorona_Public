Justice must be served. I am pleased my former colleague and Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison has also charged the three other officers involved in George Floyd's murder and is elevating the charges against Derek Chauvin to second-degree murder.,2020-06-03 19:19:49,Twitter Web App,4,15
George Floyd’s murder was not an isolated incident. Sadly Black Americans continue to be victimized by police brutality. That is why I am supporting @RepPressley’s resolution condemning police brutality &amp; calling for systemic policing reforms to achieve racial equity.,2020-06-03 18:54:16,Twitter Web App,5,14
Our nation is in a battle against two pandemics both of which disproportionately impact Black Americans.
