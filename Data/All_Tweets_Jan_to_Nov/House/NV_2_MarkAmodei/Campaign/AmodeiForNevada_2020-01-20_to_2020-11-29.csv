Knowing @PAckermanNV's respect for accuracy we’re working for PBS 2 cover the @LWVNN debate. FTR CD2 deserves the respect of not asking its candidates to travel 400mi to debate. Nobody’s asking the LV candidates to. I look forward 2 debating on Oct 16 in Carson sure you do too https://t.co/ZfnT11jx71,2020-09-03 18:53:06,Twitter Web App,2,4
Thank you for your support Nevada! Although the road ahead will be filled with difficult choices and hard work we’ve already accomplished so much together and I’m confident we can continue making a difference for the Silver State #NV02,2020-06-11 15:41:16,Twitter for iPhone,4,10
