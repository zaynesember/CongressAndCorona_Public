The impacts of this petition — more danger for whales and even more difficulty earning a living for lobstermen — should make it a non-starter.

Pew claims these closures protect right whales a cause most lobstermen support. But lobstermen want proof that the actions they're asked to take will actually help.

After a constituent came to us with the idea for this legislation I worked w/ @SenAngusKing to make it a reality. We announced the bipartisan Gold Star Families Parks Pass Act this week.  Proud to work across the aisle on this bill with @RobWittman @SenAlexander &amp; @SteveDaines,2020-03-06 14:23:00,Twitter Web App,3,28
Our bill is common sense: families of fallen servicemembers should have free access to America’s most treasured places: our national parks. It’s a simple gesture but it can make a difference in Gold Star Families' lives and that’s important. #mepolitics  https://t.co/hIR5h6ATYf,2020-03-06 14:22:58,Twitter Web App,8,42

I’m concerned the move will leave my fellow Marines without the top-quality training and equipment they need to do their jobs. Last week I asked General Berger what his command will do to ensure Marines maintain their edge in close combat if the task force heads to the Army. https://t.co/0E5XgFqvMI,2020-03-04 18:00:00,Twitter Web App,0,4

I want to fix that so I introduced a bill to expand SBDCs and bring their services to more small biz in more communities. The bill passed the House but hasn't yet passed the Senate.

We got it done. The president signed a one-year extension of the Health Coverage Tax Credit into law. It’s great news but we need a long-term fix as well. That’s why Rep. Turner and I are pushing a bill that extends the program for five full years. 3/   https://t.co/YT4peot6Qx,2020-02-26 23:23:11,Twitter Web App,1,8
So I went to work joining with Republican Mike Turner of OH to preserve the tax credit. In Maine it helps dozens of Madawaska retirees access health insurance right now.

When I was up in Madawaska last year I sat down with workers at the paper mill. They told me that many retirees from the mill weren’t going to be able to afford good health insurance in 2020 when a program called the Health Coverage Tax Credit was set to expire. 1/  #mepolitics,2020-02-26 23:23:11,Twitter Web App,2,13

During my time there I got an update on the progress that Cabin in the Woods — a program I helped launch back in the State House — has made in the last few years.

I’m not afraid to fight for unions and workers’ rights. When House leaders wouldn’t bring up the #PROAct for a vote I led a group of 75 Members of Congress to bring the bill up for a vote.   That vote takes place tonight and I'm confident we'll pass this bill through the House.,2020-02-07 00:15:13,Twitter Web App,2,15
The #PROAct gives unions more power to negotiate for their workers provides new worker protections and finally holds corporations who violate workers’ rights accountable. It’s the most significant legislation to strengthen unions and hold corporations accountable in 80 years. https://t.co/YFhw709ayi,2020-02-07 00:15:13,Twitter Web App,6,17
Expanding unions and empowering workers is one of the effective things we can do to make the economy work better for regular Mainers rather than for corporations and the wealthy. That’s why I’ve been working hard to pass the #PROAct.   https://t.co/TxWDFD5tgW,2020-02-07 00:15:12,Twitter Web App,1,7
The data shows that if you join a union you’ll have better pay better benefits and a safer workplace.

My guest at the State of the Union was Chris Wiers.
