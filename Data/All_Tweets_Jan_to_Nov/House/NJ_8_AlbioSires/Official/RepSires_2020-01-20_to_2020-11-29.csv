According to @HUDgov data in FY19 alone 84088 households were assisted 19532 jobs were created/retained and over 9 million people and 19499 households benefited from programs &amp; improvements operated by CDBG grantees. To me that clearly shows a program making a real impact.,2020-02-12 19:16:16,Twitter for iPhone,2,18

I am disappointed with the #SCOTUS decision to allow public charge immigration restrictions. The U.S. has always been a land of opportunity &amp; a safe haven from injustice. To deny entry because of wealth is morally wrong and against our national character. https://t.co/qL6ZKyFvoj,2020-01-27 20:54:25,Twitter Web App,4,19

El gob hondureño protegió a los legisladores bajo investigación por corrupción en vez de proteger a una institución apoyada por 75% de los hondureños. @ofchb debe minimizar ese daño y permitir que los fiscales nacionales continúen desenredando las redes de corrupción en Honduras.,2020-01-24 15:10:28,Twitter Web App,2,5
@JuanOrlandoH debilitó la lucha contra la corrupción en Honduras cuando eliminó @OEA_MACCIH pero FG @ofchb puede salvar una parta de esa lucha. Le pido crear una nueva oficina para continuar las investigaciones de @UFECIC1 e incorporar a su personal en esa oficina.,2020-01-24 15:10:28,Twitter Web App,3,4
By ending MACCIH the Honduran govt protected legislators under investigation for corruption rather than protecting an institution supported by 75% of Hondurans. @ofchb can minimize the damage by enabling domestic anti-corruption prosecutors to continue their critical work.,2020-01-24 15:09:22,Twitter Web App,3,2
@JuanOrlandoH struck a huge blow to the anti-corruption fight in Honduras by eliminating @OEA_MACCIH but AG @ofchb can salvage part of that fight. I urge AG Chinchilla to create a new office to continue the investigations of @UFECIC1 and integrate its staff into that office.,2020-01-24 15:09:21,Twitter Web App,6,7

Today I returned from a congressional delegation to #Guyana with @RepGregoryMeeks and @RepYvetteClarke.

#RoevWade became law 47 years ago #OTD to protect a woman’s right to control her health care decisions. Despite relentless efforts to restrict that right  I promise to fight for every person to have access to the quality reproductive health care they deserve.,2020-01-22 18:24:04,Twitter for iPhone,5,20
