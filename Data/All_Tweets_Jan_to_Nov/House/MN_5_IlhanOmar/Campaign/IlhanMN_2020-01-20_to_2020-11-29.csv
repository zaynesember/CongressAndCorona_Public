@BreeMinneapolis @BullyCreative @willhailer Bree I hear you but I can tell you that is not the case here no matter how much it’s insinuated. The firm is also not “run” by him he is a partner. I pay for work that this firm does with multiple employees who do that work.,2020-07-31 22:25:05,Twitter for iPhone,1,4
@BullyCreative I meant campaigns since this conversation is solely about that.,2020-07-31 22:16:27,Twitter for iPhone,0,3
@BullyCreative I think that has been the goal for those that have made this an issue know my burn rate is low and we have been effective in raising money. People have even accuse Keith for setting it up even though Will and I have been friends for years.,2020-07-31 22:08:36,Twitter for iPhone,1,16
@BreeMinneapolis @BullyCreative No why hire a new firm for a job our current firm does and does it well. They know our district and how to be effective. Our ad placements aren’t all over the place like others have been and that’s because @willhailer is brilliant and effective.,2020-07-31 22:05:17,Twitter for iPhone,2,9
@BullyCreative I disagree folks who are donating and supporting others starting recruiting the day I won my last primary. Many have their spouses working for them directly I don’t. What I pay the firm pays for the work that gets done by multiple staff at any given moment.,2020-07-31 22:00:26,Twitter for iPhone,1,9
@BullyCreative Thank you for the support. Now to your question they do the ad buys as our consulting firm for us. Tim + Will used to work for Keith and they became partners in this firm right after he ran for AG. Fortunately I knew Will and hired them right away. It was easy and convenient.,2020-07-31 21:56:04,Twitter for iPhone,2,51
We are motivated by radical love of country.  We fight for universal healthcare because of love.  We fight for a livable planet because of love.  We fight for equitable housing because of love.,2020-07-31 21:36:05,Twitter for iPhone,374,2925
Working everyday to address this pandemic police violence and economic disparities is how we show our love for our country and everyone living in it.,2020-07-31 21:28:27,Twitter for iPhone,382,4010
Refusing to put together a national response to a pandemic that has killed 150k people is not loving our country.  Prioritizing profits over people is not loving our country.  Refusing to unite our country is not loving our country. https://t.co/labNsYWtKy,2020-07-31 21:28:12,Twitter for iPhone,3569,20239
@ErinMayeQuade @done_enough This is also a case of not recognizing each other’s humanity and dignity. Yes as members of Congress we have a duty to vote but as humans we also have unforeseen illnesses deaths and health crisises. Treating people w/compassion is really missing in our society.,2020-07-31 20:14:10,Twitter for iPhone,2,25
@ErinMayeQuade @done_enough I also lost a family member to cancel and that was a hard choice to make as well. Workers are forced to choose everyday on matters of health funerals and unrecognized holidays and their jobs/paychecks. This is why I fight for paid sick/safe time and offer it to my staff.,2020-07-31 20:08:50,Twitter for iPhone,2,34
@fiveburger @The_Birchman We have. I also lost a family member to cancel and that was a hard choice to make as well. Workers are forced to choose everyday on matter of health funerals and unrecognized holidays and their jobs/paychecks. This is why I fight for paid sick/safe time and offer it to my staff.,2020-07-31 20:05:05,Twitter for iPhone,0,4
So proud to have the support of @Tim_Walz!  I look forward to our continued partnership in addressing deep disparities in our state and fighting for a more progressive Minnesota. https://t.co/SS6T4qnxbO,2020-07-31 17:50:14,Twitter for iPhone,80,656
Today is Eid Congress is yet again in session.   For me and the few other Muslims it means we miss celebrating it with our families.  My time in Congress so far has been making this difficult choice between votes and family.   Isra Adnan and Ilwad I am sorry.   Eid Mubarak. https://t.co/SsBjNpgxHu,2020-07-31 14:52:18,Twitter for iPhone,1014,13688
Eid Mubarak! ❤️  Wishing everyone peace safety and prosperity this #EidAlAdha. We need it now more than ever.,2020-07-31 13:41:25,Twitter for iPhone,1704,13058
Thousands of Minnesotans are losing their expanded unemployment benefits — $600 more a week they’re counting on to keep a roof over their head and food on the table.  The House has already moved to extend the extra benefits. The Senate must act before the August rent is due.,2020-07-31 13:21:07,Twitter Web App,355,2271
Healthcare is a human right. Not "access" to care. Not "affordable" care. Just care period. We need Medicare For All to provide comprehensive care to every person in this country regardless of income at no cost at the point of service. Anything less isn't enough. https://t.co/ltcUJUvvYx,2020-07-31 01:22:23,Twitter for iPhone,679,3176
No child in America should face the hunger I experienced as a young refugee.  I just helped introduce a bill to guarantee #SchoolMeals4All during this pandemic so we’re one step closer to eliminating child hunger for good.,2020-07-30 21:45:36,Twitter Web App,924,6821
This Sunday hang out with @AOC @AyannaPressley @KeithEllison and me — plus more progressive champions — for a special live stream on our August Day of Action!  Sign up to learn more on how you can help us get out the vote 👇🏽👇🏽👇🏽 https://t.co/dHRRbGJcGR,2020-07-30 21:11:18,Twitter Web App,134,658
War is not a game. Video games should not be recruitment tools for the military. And it’s particularly concerning that users were blocked from platforms by the US military for asking about war crimes raising serious first amendment concerns. I am proud to work with @AOC on this. https://t.co/GxPx5bZj8J,2020-07-30 17:03:16,Twitter for iPhone,4458,33045
Throughout history opponents of progress have said our dreams were “unrealistic.”  They said it about Women’s Rights. They said it about Civil Rights. They said it about Medicare.  It is up to us to determine what is realistic. When we fight for meaningful change we achieve it.,2020-07-30 15:56:35,Twitter for iPhone,1062,4788
✅ Wear a mask ✅ Wash your hands ✅ Vote for progressives up and down the ballot,2020-07-30 13:32:54,Twitter for iPhone,3013,20715
Over-policing our schools doesn’t make them safer — it criminalizes Black and brown students. That’s why I just introduced legislation with @AyannaPressley @ewarren and @ChrisMurphyCT to replace police officers in schools with mental health professionals to support students.,2020-07-29 23:48:30,Twitter Web App,1617,9571
“There are only in my view a handful of great members of Congress. People who have the guts to take on powerful special interests. … they have a vision for a very different America.” —@BernieSanders   Let's keep building this progressive coalition! 💪🏽 https://t.co/IyTqjvckS8,2020-07-29 21:43:25,Twitter Web App,185,1152
🥳  Minnesota is on the right side of history for affirming that no one should be denied the opportunity to rent a property simply because they receive public assistance.  Next let’s pass #HomesForAll to guarantee housing for every Minnesotan and American! https://t.co/vRA3yu1Zfv,2020-07-29 19:30:29,Twitter Web App,138,991
Stop saying “we can’t afford” Homes for All Green New Deal or Medicare for All.  If we didn't spend trillions on endless wars and tax breaks for millionaires we could afford to house our homeless care for our seniors and save our planet.  We suffer from greed not scarcity.,2020-07-29 17:26:54,Twitter for iPhone,39817,146427
No one believed the Revolution would start in Minnesota except Prince!  Thank you @andrecymone. Forever inspired by your music and activism. https://t.co/vZskqMNP48,2020-07-29 14:37:41,Twitter for iPhone,133,1394

Every #COVID19 relief bill must support the needs of people suffering from economic injustice — not those of corporations.  Cancel student debt extend unemployment benefits and bail out the people! https://t.co/ADfO2Ux8I4,2020-07-29 00:47:56,Twitter Web App,451,1801
Protecting working families means protecting their wages their time off and their right to collectively bargain. $15 and a union is not just a rallying cry it's essential for economic stability. https://t.co/snlxSy18o0,2020-07-28 23:32:13,Twitter for iPhone,121,659
While we’ve seen great progress with the House’s #EqualityAct and the recent Supreme Court victory for LGBTQ+ workers we have a long way to go in the fight for full equality for LGBTQ+ Americans — and I’m honored to work with @HRC to keep up the fight in Congress. https://t.co/2PAXuBxFzB,2020-07-28 21:38:10,Twitter Web App,58,360
If my generation had acted with urgency after Columbine my teenage daughter’s generation wouldn’t need to be at the state capitol asking for sensible gun laws.  We must fight alongside young people for transformative change. https://t.co/wTkRB2JgjI,2020-07-28 20:07:34,Twitter Web App,294,2202
Tying healthcare to employment is wrong — before during and after a pandemic.  Pass #MedicareForAll now.,2020-07-28 13:36:24,Twitter Web App,4588,26400
Hollow rhetoric won’t guarantee healthcare for all or feed our children or house people in Minnesota and across the country — unapologetically bold policies rooted in radical love will. https://t.co/zZHIH6ypSu,2020-07-28 01:22:53,Twitter Web App,1370,5399

How do we have this cognitive dissonance where we’re OK with paying tens of thousands of dollars … a year to incarcerate folks but we’re not OK with paying that money to put it into communities to keep people OK?” —@CedFrazierMN https://t.co/TC1PLz2Ck9,2020-07-27 00:55:32,Twitter for iPhone,68,312

We've taken on corporations that put profit over people. A campaign system fueled by corporate cash. A justice system that doesn’t recognize our humanity. A president who wants to send us back.

But for conditions to be so poor that they feel forced to give up food in protest is inhumane on an entirely different level.  #AbolishICE https://t.co/Se2oFYjnIJ,2020-02-14 22:01:09,Twitter for iPhone,505,1787

The House and the Senate have spoken: #NoWarWithIran.  If the president abuses his veto power by rejecting this resolution he’s rejecting the will of both chambers of Congress and our sole constitutional power to declare war.

It’s not complicated: Our system is rigged because corporations are buying politicians into blocking laws that would improve lives.  It’s on us to finally put power in the hands of the people.,2020-02-13 14:51:28,Twitter for iPhone,3407,18309
The Constitution doesn’t recognize women as equal under the law.   This arbitrary deadline is yet another obstacle in the way of gender equity and we won’t accept it. https://t.co/PREf7LZRYY,2020-02-13 13:14:48,Twitter for iPhone,777,4327

Shirley Chisholm — the first Black woman in Congress and the first woman and African American of a major party to run for president — is the reason millions have SNAP benefits and why Black women who were told to wait our turn have a voice in Congress now. #BlackHistoryMonth https://t.co/4Y0vFtXctv,2020-02-12 14:32:02,Twitter Web App,1038,4866
