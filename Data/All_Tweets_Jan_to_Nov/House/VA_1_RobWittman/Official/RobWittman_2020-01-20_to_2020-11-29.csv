As a former public health official I know the critical role our public officials play in combating potential epidemics. I’m glad we were able to come together to get this emergency supplemental passed and hope my colleagues in the Senate are soon to follow.,2020-03-04 23:01:20,Twitter Web App,0,6
This bill provides important funding that allows the Administration to address the virus at home and abroad including expediting vaccine development purchasing essential equipment and supplies and assisting state and local health departments.,2020-03-04 23:01:20,Twitter Web App,2,6
Today I voted to approve over $7 billion in emergency funding for the U.S. response to the Coronavirus as well as extending emergency telehealth services. This legislation is the product of a bipartisan compromise to address this emergency.,2020-03-04 23:01:20,Twitter Web App,3,26
We’ve made a significant amount of process but we’ve got more work to do. Together we will continue to clean up the Chesapeake Bay by ensuring critical federal funding and extending key programs that benefit the watershed.,2020-03-04 18:41:58,Twitter Web App,0,4
I have been working across the aisle to advance key Bay initiatives like the Chesapeake Bay Program Reauthorization Act Chesapeake Bay Gateways and Watertrails Network Reauthorization Act Chesapeake Bay Science Education and Ecosystem Enhancement Act and Chesapeake WILD Act.,2020-03-04 18:41:58,Twitter Web App,0,6

There are ongoing discussions about who should be funding Surge Sealift Recapitalization whether it should be Army or the Navy but we cannot keep putting it on the backburner #McAleese,2020-03-04 15:04:26,Twitter for iPhone,0,1
We must also prioritize Sealift Recapitalization. The readiness goal is to have an 85% availability rate to support large-scale force deployments. …Our availability rate? 40.7%. How can we expect our soldiers to fight if they cannot get to the fight? #McAleese,2020-03-04 15:04:26,Twitter for iPhone,0,2
Navy’s FY21 plan takes a step back by requesting 8 ships in FY21 and even includes accelerated unanticipated ship retirement. This is not how I believe we can get to a #355ships by 2030.,2020-03-04 15:04:25,Twitter for iPhone,0,0
For us in Congress working on the NDAA this means one simple thing: Make the dollar work harder than the Yuan and the Ruble. #McAleese,2020-03-04 15:04:25,Twitter for iPhone,2,6

I’m also concerned about the entire Columbia-class ballistic missile submarine coming from the Navy budget. This is a critical strategic asset that is vital to our nuclear deterrence and this behemoth of a bill should not be borne by the Navy alone.,2020-02-27 23:06:39,Twitter Web App,0,4
After receiving the Navy’s Budget for FY2021 I'm deeply concerned that we have shifted off the path necessary to reach a #355ship Navy. The shipbuilding account is wholly inadequate to meet our strategic demands. A #355ship Navy is not just a goal it's the law.,2020-02-27 23:06:39,Twitter Web App,1,12

Yesterday the Senate voted on the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act.  House Republicans tried over 80 times to have a vote on this bill in the House but Dems have blocked it every time.

Only 18 legislative days left until Congress must pass our guiding budget resolution. Unfortunately this probably won’t happen. Why not?

The budget published today does not invest nearly enough in shipbuilding. It is clear to me we are in a full-scale strategic competition. While China is on track to reach a 420-ship Navy by 2035 we are struggling to stay on track with our 355-ship Navy shipbuilding plan.,2020-02-10 21:33:52,Twitter Web App,6,29

Instead of commending @POTUS for his bold action to protect Americans House Democrats are doing all they can to limit the powers of the President. We should not tie the hands of any president for defending this nation.,2020-01-30 21:39:00,Twitter Web App,9,35
