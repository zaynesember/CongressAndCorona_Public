This morning @POTUS signed the spending bill passed by the House yesterday granting more emergency relief for small businesses in the nation. If you are a small business that would like to take advantage of this program head over to https://t.co/MBjqElfstr for more information. https://t.co/M5ljy0iOpV,2020-04-24 19:43:51,Twitter for iPhone,1,2
After a week of asking the Speaker for the vote the House passed more emergency relief for our small businesses. Although the stalling by Democrats has been detrimental to small businesses I hope that this helps those small businesses that are struggling during this tough time. https://t.co/SJ7nslVI2v,2020-04-23 22:18:43,Twitter for iPhone,1,2
Although I am happy to see the Speaker finally taking this seriously I’m deeply troubled that it took this long. For some this is too late. We have been asking for this for a week while Democrats in both chambers have stalled.   It’s time for a change.   https://t.co/RWJ0AeRAmG,2020-04-22 14:02:59,Twitter for iPhone,1,1
We must support our Small Businesses in need—the backbone of the American economy. The Republican Conference is committed to that while Democrats pivot for “leverage” to pass their dream policy list.   Our small businesses need help NOW.   Its time to vote NOW. https://t.co/8kYM8ExCrI,2020-04-21 14:46:53,Twitter for iPhone,1,0
Happy Easter! The most important message that Christ taught was hope -- not only hope in each other or hope in ourselves but the hope of a better ending for each of us. #HeIsRisen https://t.co/CNx2lkRRqs,2020-04-12 15:51:46,Twitter for iPhone,3,6
