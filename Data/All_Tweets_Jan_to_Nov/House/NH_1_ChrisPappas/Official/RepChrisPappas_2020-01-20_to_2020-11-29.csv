Our country and our economy are depending on us to come together - across party lines - to make PPP more flexible more generous and more responsive to the needs of Main Street.

To be eligible for loan forgiveness businesses can allocate no more than 25% of PPP loans to non-payroll expenses. Given that many NH employers still face high overhead costs and relatively low payroll expenses this threshold should be raised by at least 15%.,2020-05-11 15:40:54,Twitter Web App,0,0
Instead of starting once funds are disbursed small businesses should be allowed greater flexibility to determine when the forgiveness period begins.
