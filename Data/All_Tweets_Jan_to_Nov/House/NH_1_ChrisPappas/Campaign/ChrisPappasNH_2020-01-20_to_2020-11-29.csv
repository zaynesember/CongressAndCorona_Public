Small businesses drive our economy and define the character of our communities. This holiday season they need our patronage more than ever. On #SmallBusinessSaturday I encourage Granite Staters to #ShopSmall and support our local businesses—in a socially-distanced way or online. https://t.co/DK33yK8r4D,2020-11-28 13:00:00,TweetDeck,2,19
