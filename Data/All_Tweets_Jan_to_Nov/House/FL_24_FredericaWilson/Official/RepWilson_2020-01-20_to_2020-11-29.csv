75% is not a figure to be ignored. Americans want and deserve to hear from witnesses. Do the right thing Senate GOPers. #ForThePeople #DefendOurDemocracy  https://t.co/ApeqoyqMsU,2020-01-28 22:55:52,Twitter Web App,13,67
POTUS takes credit for the strong economy but a new @JECDems report reveals he didn’t create it; he inherited it. From the #GOPTaxScam to trade wars he’s putting our economy at risk &amp; ignoring the uncertainty Americans feel. #TrumpBrokenPromises https://t.co/3qX9HtV1fT,2020-01-28 20:39:20,Twitter Web App,41,72

Why is the #2020Census so important? Because without an accurate count our community won't get the federal funds it needs for education health care job opportunities congressional and state legislative representation—and more.

They're trying to be droll but such behavior is a mockery that disrespects both the oath they took at the start of the #impeachment trial and the American people. https://t.co/HWZTjarY9V,2020-01-23 22:22:33,Twitter Web App,95,245

If you've ever done jury duty or just watched episodes of Law &amp; Order you know a trial isn't a trial without some testimony. If #MidnightMitch doesn't allow witnesses it's because he does not want Americans to hear the truth. What's he afraid we'll learn? #DefendOurDemocracy,2020-01-21 21:45:09,Twitter Web App,24,101
