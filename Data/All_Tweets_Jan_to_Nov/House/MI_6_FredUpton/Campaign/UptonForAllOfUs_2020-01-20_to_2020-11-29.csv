Just last week I was named the most bipartisan legislator in the COUNTRY receiving a perfect score of 100. @Jonhoadley would vote as a rubber stamp for Dem leadership 100% of the time. #MI06Debate https://t.co/OiAkXslZeD,2020-10-26 23:53:18,TweetDeck,1,1

Hard-working folks have earned these benefits &amp; I will always protect them in Congress. #MI06Debate #MI06 https://t.co/iW1gFKnjBI,2020-10-26 23:40:04,Twitter Web App,2,8
No matter what @JonHoadley claims I have worked and will continue to work with both parties to lower prescription drug costs. Period. #MI06Debate #MI06 https://t.co/U2en2WkzsY,2020-10-26 23:37:27,Twitter Web App,2,5
I have always fought to lower prescription drug prices while also ensuring the U.S. remains a leader in developing cures to the world's toughest diseases. That's why I strongly supported H.R. 19 the Lower Costs More Cures Act that does both. #MI06Debate #MI06,2020-10-26 23:35:31,Twitter Web App,1,6
Prescription drug prices are just too high for folks across the country. I was just 1 of 5 Republicans to support H.R. 987 the Strengthening Health Care &amp; Lowering Prescription Drug Costs Act. I also supported the H.R. 19 the Lower Costs More Cures Act. #MI06Debate #MI06,2020-10-26 23:35:12,Twitter Web App,1,4
.@jonhoadley is once again misleading voters on my health care record. The truth is I was one of 8 Republicans to support H. Res. 271 “Condemning the Trump Administration’s Legal Campaign to Take Away Americans’ Health Care." #MI06Debate #MI06,2020-10-26 23:34:47,Twitter Web App,1,0
Despite @jonhoadley's misleading claims about my record of course I DO NOT support removing protections for folks w/ pre-existing conditions. Any claim to the contrary is false &amp; misleading. #MI06Debate #MI06,2020-10-26 23:34:36,Twitter Web App,1,4
Under @jonhoadley’s strong support for Medicare for All 150 million Americans would lose their private health insurance &amp; taxpayers would also have to foot the bill to the tune of more than $32 TRILLION. #MI06Debate #MI06,2020-10-26 23:34:21,Twitter Web App,1,3
.@jonhoadley made his stance on public safety clear. His vision would make our communities less safe. Law enforcement needs MORE resources to do their jobs – not fewer. That's why law enforcement would be concerned if Jon was elected. #MI06Debate #MI06 https://t.co/hYtxOyPiCw,2020-10-26 23:32:01,Twitter Web App,1,4
.@JonHoadley turned his back on law enforcement. I signed a pledge to stand with law enforcement. Only one candidate in the #MI06 race is committed to public safety. #MI06Debate https://t.co/coKEeXA7gW,2020-10-26 23:31:16,Twitter Web App,1,2
I will NEVER vote to defund the police. That's why I have the support of the Police Officers Association of Michigan &amp; law enforcement officers across #MI06. They know I'll always have their backs just as they always have ours. https://t.co/xqPlbCZzar #MI06Debate,2020-10-26 23:29:14,Twitter Web App,1,8

This summer I joined thousands of folks in protests across SW MI to condemn police brutality and call for an end to racial injustice. We must always work toward building a more perfect union for ALL Americans &amp; we can do so together. #MI06Debate #MI06,2020-10-26 23:28:02,Twitter Web App,1,4

.@jonhoadley is trying to walk back his vote against law enforcement. Here's the truth – the resolution asked local gov’ts not to defund the police. He voted against it. He turned his back on our law enforcement. https://t.co/Jx5wgwN2Fe #MI06Debate #MI06,2020-10-26 23:26:50,Twitter Web App,1,0
@JonHoadley The HEROES Act was never a real proposal to deliver real relief to folks across the country. More than a dozen Democrats opposed it &amp; the White House issued a veto warning. We need a BIPARTISAN package that will deliver immediate relief. #MI06Debate #MI06,2020-10-26 23:19:22,TweetDeck,1,0
My PPP Forgiveness Act cuts burdensome red tape &amp; saved businesses time &amp; money by converting PPP loans for the smallest firms into grants. My record is clear here - I will continue to fight for our small biz as they look to get back on their feet #MI06Debate #MI06,2020-10-26 23:18:17,Twitter Web App,1,2
Ever since relief talks stalled on Cap Hill my Problem Solvers Caucus colleagues &amp; I have been hard at work on our March to Common Ground bill. This is a serious bipartisan proposal that delivers real relief to folks &amp; can actually become law. #MI06Debate #MI06,2020-10-26 23:17:34,Twitter Web App,1,2
When our small biz in SW MI needed our support I worked to secure billions of dollars to help keep their doors open. The #PPP has protected 51M jobs - including 1.5M in MI - &amp; I was proud to strongly vote to replenish it when funds ran dry. #MI06Debate #MI06,2020-10-26 23:17:21,Twitter Web App,1,1

COVID-19 has opened our eyes to the urgent need to make life-saving cures in the USA.

When COVID-19 first hit American soil I was helping day and night on our major federal response. I strongly supported both the CARES Act &amp; the Families First Coronavirus Response Act to deliver real relief to our families small businesses schools &amp; workers. #MI06Debate #MI06,2020-10-26 23:11:01,Twitter Web App,1,5
