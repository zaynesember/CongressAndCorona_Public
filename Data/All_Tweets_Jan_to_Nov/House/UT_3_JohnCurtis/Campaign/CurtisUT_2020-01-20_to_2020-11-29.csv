Deer Creek Reservoir is vital to Utah’s economy both for water supply and for recreation. We urge the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to issue a WIFIA loan for the Deer Creek Raw Water Intake Project. https://t.co/ejWmwqeo9f,2020-08-23 00:23:57,Twitter Web App,2,12
With unemployment levels at a record high our goal should be to deliver targeted aid to those who desperately need it most. Local economies across the country are working tirelessly to reopen in the safest way possible to help get Americans back to work - let's help them do so.,2020-08-10 19:19:13,Twitter Web App,0,6
On Friday I introduced the Returning Inappropriate Cash Handouts (RICH) Act to bar anyone with an income of $1 million or more this year from receiving unemployment payments. https://t.co/O2DwHqCaAr,2020-08-10 19:19:13,Twitter Web App,0,18

I have introduced new legislation to help America's small businesses keep their doors open. Learn more about how the bipartisan Paycheck Protection Program Small Business Enhancement Act will provide more resources for our hard-working small businesses: https://t.co/N8rIo78XQ0,2020-08-03 20:01:07,Twitter Web App,2,1
A second PPP loan could be make-or-break for these mostly family-owned establishments and fighting to keep their doors open is a cause that I am unquestioningly willing to support. (3/4),2020-08-03 20:01:07,Twitter Web App,0,2

Access to child care is a key factor to getting Utahns back to work but simply throwing billions of dollars at the industry &amp; tacking on more regulations will not fix the problem.
