Q: Why are medical masks so hard to come by?  A: The supply doesn't meet the demand. We were not prepared from a supply chain standpoint &amp; now the entire world needs them.   🚨The @CDCgov &amp; @GovHerbert recommend cloth masks for the public; N95 masks are for medical professionals.,2020-04-10 00:36:44,Twitter Web App,0,0
Q: Will the warmer weather bring #COVID19 relief?  A: No data to support either way. Influenza is seasonal in some areas but constant in tropical regions. Just because it's warming up doesn't mean we'll see relief. This is a novel virus-- we don't know how it'll be affected.,2020-04-10 00:29:49,Twitter Web App,0,1

Q: If you don't have symptoms should you try and be tested?   A: You're safest in your home away from exposure to possible germs.

Q: Could those who test negative go back to work to help the economy?  A: No because testing negative means you don't have the virus that day not that you're immune. There's no choice between the economy or lives: if we let people die the economy is destroyed for a lot longer.,2020-03-27 02:08:12,Twitter Web App,1,4
Q: How is this different from SARS?  A: SARS was lethal but didn’t spread with the same efficacy. COVID19 is spread more easily by coughing sneezing and droplets plus 80% with this virus are walking around with a mild illness able to spread it unknowingly.,2020-03-27 02:05:21,Twitter Web App,0,0
Q: Could parts of the country start moving again? Will normal life return all at once?   A: Depends on us. Each city/state has the power to control the scope with social distancing. We're pretty well ahead of the curve in Utah for preventing/slowing the spread- let's stick w/it!,2020-03-27 02:03:37,Twitter Web App,0,1
Q: Why do we social distance? Why not carry about our normal lives?  A: If we let the disease move unchecked we'll have far too many cases than hospitals can handle.  By keeping the wave down we have time to develop drugs to treat this and eventually an effective vaccine.,2020-03-27 01:56:09,Twitter Web App,0,1

In Utah we're performing 2600 tests a day last week was 100.

On adequate testing in rural Utah:   Unless you are having difficulties breathing there's no point in getting a test because there is no medicine to cure it yet. Stay home and take care of yourself.
