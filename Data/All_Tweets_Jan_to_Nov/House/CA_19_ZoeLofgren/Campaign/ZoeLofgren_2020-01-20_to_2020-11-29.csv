California’s House Democrats know how lucky we’ve been to have @KamalaHarris fighting for our state’s priorities &amp; our country’s values as our Senator.

As the Chair of the CA Democratic Congressional Delegation I am proud to support @ChristyforCA25 and I will be doing everything I can to help her win the CA25 special election on May 12th. I hope you’ll pitch in and help too. https://t.co/pZXjLCiALu,2020-04-08 22:42:19,Twitter for iPhone,4,12
