This is good news for children &amp; families.  As I've said before 'Remain in Mexico' is inconsistent w/@DHSgov's authority &amp; inhumanely forces thousands to wait in dangerous conditions before their asylum claims are heard.

Executive privilege cannot be used to prevent a witness who is willing to testify from appearing and certainly not one who no longer works in government. It’s not a gag order. And witnesses testify on national security all the time.  Bolton has a right to testify if he wants to. https://t.co/4FtvPDgtDl,2020-01-23 17:16:34,Twitter Web App,4376,12190
