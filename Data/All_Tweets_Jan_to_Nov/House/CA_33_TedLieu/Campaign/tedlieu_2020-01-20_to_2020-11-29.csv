Dear @realDonaldTrump: The House went big and passed a $3.4 trillion Heroes Act. We also passed a $2.2 bill. Instead of playing golf again you can request the Senate to send you one of the bills. Then your name instead of Biden’s next year will be on the stimulus checks. https://t.co/8BH1ehTZoX,2020-11-28 18:31:24,Twitter for iPhone,1770,7143

Michael Flynn committed a felony. But since he is a friend of @realDonaldTrump he gets special treatment no ordinary person gets like a pardon.

Let me be very clear:  CONGRESSIONAL SUBPOENAS AND CONTEMPT OF CONGRESS RESOLUTION ARE BOTH MEANINGLESS BECAUSE WE CAN’T ENFORCE THEM.  Takes *years* to litigate.

Today is Saturday. That means @realDonaldTrump is lying again. Trump has lost over 30 lawsuits and in many cases the attorneys stipulate there was no fraud.

I’m going to give my personal view:  CONGRESSIONAL SUBPOENAS ARE MEANINGLESS BECAUSE WE CANNOT ENFORCE THEM.  The GSA will simply ignore the subpoena and litigate which takes years to resolve.

Dear @realDonaldTrump: You are wrong again Wayne County certified. Because this is America and here right matters. Truth matters.  Also you lost Michigan by over 140000 votes. That’s not even close.

Chris Krebs is a Trump appointee.

So @realDonaldTrump apparently wants to try the “faithless” elector strategy now and convince **Dem** electors to reject Biden’s convincing win. Take a look at the electors from Georgia.

Why is the “faithless” elector strategy not only unconstitutional but also stupid?

Dear @realDonaldTrump: The largest surge in TX came from Asian American voters the fastest rising group in America. Hate crimes increased against Asian Americans due to racist views about the virus.

Did I stay up to wait for these NYT/Siena polls? I did. And they are more good polls for @JoeBiden.

Dear @realDonaldTrump: My brother is a doctor. He gets no extra money if a patient dies of #COVID19. He is saddened that you are now accusing frontline health workers of lying.  Over 230000 Americans died from COVID19 in less than 8 months under your watch. That is your legacy. https://t.co/rimVyJVqeX,2020-10-25 06:59:15,Twitter for iPhone,10002,30692

@smoothsmokie @realDonaldTrump You must not have read my tweet. I’m urging people to not spread the virus because a vaccine is close.,2020-10-14 18:28:07,Twitter for iPhone,5,8
The reason we invested billions of dollars in taxpayer funds for vaccines is to avoid exposing the virus to millions of Americans. What’s the point of vaccines if @realDonaldTrump just wants to infect people? Embrace of herd immunity now makes no sense when vaccines are close. https://t.co/aGs3PDGcpm,2020-10-14 18:22:49,Twitter for iPhone,2545,5601
If @realDonaldTrump believes we will get vaccines soon then there’s no reason to let the virus spread. There is every reason to contain it. How bad would you feel if a family member died from Covid19 a month before a vaccine became available? Trump’s new strategy makes no sense. https://t.co/6W0VEK9dCm,2020-10-14 16:47:40,Twitter for iPhone,669,1930
This action by @realDonaldTrump &amp; @WhiteHouse to embrace herd immunity will result in millions of dead Americans. The ONLY reason to let the virus spread is if you don’t believe a vaccine would work. Why don’t we let measles spread? Because there’s a frickin vaccine. https://t.co/EORPZBax7a,2020-10-14 16:38:47,Twitter for iPhone,1488,3674

@Tyga77777 @ReallyAmerican1 @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr You are totally wrong. Where do you get your information?

Dear @realDonaldTrump: The House passed a big $3.4 trillion stimulus package on May 15 called the Heroes Act. **Your name will be on all the stimulus checks.**   All you have to do is have @senatemajldr McConnell send it to you for signature.

@gelliottmorris Thank you for your illuminating posts. I have a question about this particular post. Trump’s number doesn’t change that much. He hovers between 40 and 45 in national polls. What makes this poll an outlier is the spike in Biden’s number. Why would that be a partisan non-response?,2020-10-06 18:03:09,Twitter for iPhone,4,74
Regeneron an experimental drug which @POTUS took relied on “human embryonic stem cells.” I support this research. I wonder if @realDonaldTrump and Amy Coney Barrett support this research? https://t.co/NRdkl7tTrU,2020-10-06 04:53:58,Twitter for iPhone,26073,64176

Dear @WhiteHouse and Dr. Conley: What was the time and day of the first test for the President that showed he may have #COVID19? And is that time and day different from the time and day of the official “diagnosis”? https://t.co/2wXrkEBhsE,2020-10-03 18:54:19,Twitter for iPhone,1015,3409
The President fell asleep on Air Force One on Wed. Was he lethargic on Wed? When did he first have symptoms? When was his first positive test? Neither the @WhiteHouse nor Dr. Conley have provided clear answers.  The American people deserve full transparency and the truth. https://t.co/qjMMOup2fV,2020-10-03 18:27:18,Twitter for iPhone,1306,4360
A central feature of this duplicitous @WhiteHouse is that on multiple occasions the American people are still trying to find the answer to the following question:  What did the President know and when did he know it? https://t.co/7HFdZsnIsX,2020-10-03 18:11:30,Twitter for iPhone,600,1961
Dear Dr. Conley: You took an oath to the Constitution as a military doctor. Your job is not to spin the American people. It is to tell the truth. A @WhiteHouse pool report contradicts the tenor of what you said publicly. Don’t shred your own credibility. Just tell us the truth. https://t.co/sSsHpWtLcC,2020-10-03 17:30:47,Twitter for iPhone,3923,12410
If Dr. Conley was telling the truth Trump knew he had #COVID19 on Wednesday morning.  Any elected official who tests positive for Covid19 but still attends in person events without warning the attendees needs to resign. Period. https://t.co/L0S54vjM7j,2020-10-03 16:14:01,Twitter for iPhone,16548,53627

@BuckeyeEng @realDonaldTrump I believe behavior judgment and temperament is equally if not more important. We should not help Trump by forcing him to be more civil or hiding his true self from the voters.,2020-09-30 17:05:39,Twitter for iPhone,3,22
@EVML07 @realDonaldTrump That’s your right. And it’s helpful the American people saw his behavior last night before they vote.,2020-09-30 17:04:26,Twitter for iPhone,1,6
@IshikawaMargie @realDonaldTrump I disagree. Voters should consider whether or not Trump is presidential civil follows the rules and has the judgment and temperament to be President. We should not help Trump by forcing him to be more civil.,2020-09-30 17:02:55,Twitter for iPhone,6,23
I disagree. A debate is not just about issues. It’s also about behavior judgment temperament. Americans have the right to see @realDonaldTrump unfiltered. We should not try to help Trump by making him more civil. Voters should see who he is.  #wednesdaymorning thoughts https://t.co/ux0eLMRM89,2020-09-30 16:59:11,Twitter for iPhone,421,1940
If you are reading this post then you pay more attention to politics than most Americans. It is critical for those who don’t follow politics to be exposed to who @realDonaldTrump is unfiltered and unhinged.

@KRNY100 @realDonaldTrump Sometimes my military training comes in handy.,2020-09-30 07:40:47,Twitter for iPhone,4,53
Some people think debates should only be about the issues. NO.   Behavior is just as important and perhaps more so. It was critically important that many Americans had the opportunity to see firsthand the behavior of @realDonaldTrump tonight.   #Debates2020 https://t.co/kCAwU66bZI,2020-09-30 07:38:08,Twitter for iPhone,1232,5734
Wrong take. Most people don’t pay attention to politics as much as the media &amp; politicians do. I believe it was important for the American people tonight to see who @realDonaldTrump really is.

I disagree with folks who think it’s better to control the President. NO.  It’s better for the American people to see who @realDonaldTrump really is under pressure &amp; stress.

I disagree with @JamesFallows that Chris Wallace somehow did a disservice. Wallace did America a huge favor by letting the American people see @realDonaldTrump for who he really is.

I thought @realDonaldTrump was a grifter because it’s his personality. Turns out he needs the taxpayer funds being funneled to his businesses by his repeated trips to his properties. It’s also why his campaign pays his family. Because Trump owes massive debts.  #TrumpTaxReturns https://t.co/iIJYazsuMJ,2020-09-27 23:28:12,Twitter for iPhone,5068,13256
The #TrumpTaxReturns confirm @realDonaldTrump is a massive fraud.

@OMGROFLOLJK @MarshaBlackburn Amendments change the original document. That’s what an amendment means. It amends the document which in this case is the Constitution.

Dear @realDonaldTrump: FDA Commissioner @SteveFDA is your appointee. Either fire him or stop undermining him. It’s a ridiculous way to govern because you are confusing the American people.

My reading of 18 USC § 592 and § 595 is that @realDonaldTrump can’t send civil or military personnel to the polls particularly if they would have an affect on elections.  Also no matter how hard @POTUS tries America is not a Banana Republic and we should not act like one. https://t.co/4RUJiGRXdF,2020-08-21 19:28:08,Twitter for iPhone,5440,12942

@findtruthalways @realDonaldTrump That’s just stupid. No one blames Trump for the virus.

@jimsciutto I think part of this result reflects the attack on science. Part of this may also reflect people’s concern about Trump pushing a vaccine that is not ready.

Dear @ACTBrigitte: The free market has solved the problem. It costs $24.30 to send a letter via FedEx from LA to DC with 3 day delivery. (Higher for rural areas). Or I can pay $0.55 to USPS.

This USPS tracker shows that for non-first class mail 8 business days appears to be the upper limit. 8 business days prior to Nov 3 would be the evening of Oct 22. But with ongoing sabotage of USPS by @POTUS I recommend mailing in the ballot by Oct 15.  https://t.co/cTerdMd2xo,2020-08-14 19:04:33,Twitter for iPhone,7009,14921
When @realDonaldTrump promoted his birther stuff against Obama that was racist. @POTUS is doing it again. It’s still racist.

Oh look @realDonaldTrump doubling down on racism again this time a repeat of his racist birther stuff. That’s the only thing @POTUS has left: racial grievance politics. He failed at the economy.

This also gives us the chance to fight back. And the best way to do so is to spread the message that if you are going to vote by mail you need to vote early at least 10 days in advance of Nov 3. Otherwise you need to drop off your ballot at any polling location.  #VoteByOct22 https://t.co/CMQghQxOYc,2020-08-13 20:25:47,Twitter for iPhone,1607,3261
@Guitarlord34 @POTUS Sure. But that won’t get the Post Office adequately funded in 82 days. The Senate just adjourned for the month. The White House will ignore the subpoenas. Then we need to litigate and that takes more than 82 days. I need you to accept reality and spread the message to vote early.,2020-08-13 19:50:04,Twitter for iPhone,638,1555

Here is the truth and I need you to spread it: the voters need to take control. Voters need to #VoteByOct22 if using USPS. https://t.co/lsLERIWV1a,2020-08-13 19:40:42,Twitter for iPhone,12567,18292
@decitect @senatemajldr Won’t happen. You think the Senate will do a veto override let alone even get a majority vote? No. This election is too important for me to lie to you. We win by educating the voters ASAP. Not by me telling you stuff that won’t happen.,2020-08-13 19:34:29,Twitter for iPhone,44,156
@Garyatty @SpeakerPelosi We are not fucking passive. We impeached him. I’m not going to lie to you to make you feel better when the stakes are this high. You really think the Supreme Court is going to save us? We win by educating the voters ASAP.,2020-08-13 19:31:57,Twitter for iPhone,215,681
This should be plan A B &amp; C: Massive education to voters ASAP that they need to mail their ballot at least 10 mailing days in advance of Nov 3 which would be Oct 22. The stark reality is the House cannot adequately fund USPS without the consent of Trump.  #VoteByOct22 https://t.co/qO9NNfXk4o,2020-08-13 19:27:35,Twitter for iPhone,2229,3858

@DuchessCle @realDonaldTrump @GOPLeader @POTUS There is NOTHING we can do to fund Post Office without the consent of Trump. That means the best solution is to keep screaming whether on regular or social media that voters need to mail in their ballots 10 mailing days in advance of Nov 3.  https://t.co/AfX0NvaxPJ https://t.co/7RPQLdlUCs,2020-08-13 18:25:37,Twitter for iPhone,44,78

@stevenshehori @POTUS Sure but he would likely ignore the subpoena. Then we litigate it. And that takes way more than 90 days.,2020-08-13 18:01:43,Twitter for iPhone,66,431
Dear @ACLU: You know full well the House cannot do this without the consent of Trump. The message should be: Mail your ballot 10 mailing days out which would be Oct 22. We protect democracy by educating the voters ASAP not by promising things that can’t be done.  #VoteByOct22 https://t.co/LHQSWu1dEs,2020-08-13 16:56:01,Twitter for iPhone,2539,5896

I’m going to scream this again: House doesn’t have the power to stop voter suppression by Post Office without the consent of @POTUS. So what is the best response? Get voters to understand Oct 22 is when they need to mail their ballot to ensure it arrives by Nov 3.  #VoteByOct22 https://t.co/LyxhUvRIWj,2020-08-13 16:31:35,Twitter for iPhone,16497,28535

Dear @realDonaldTrump: Germany doesn’t owe a 2% fee to NATO. I can’t tell if you’re too stupid to understand NATO or if you are intentionally lying. Every country spends its own defense budget to protect itself. Some spend more some less. But none of that is owed to NATO or US. https://t.co/k9RfOxDciE,2020-07-30 04:19:46,Twitter for iPhone,10694,30727

Let’s be honest about why Louie Gohmert made his stunning statement below. Because @GOP &amp; @realDonaldTrump believed masks would show #Covid19 is a highly contagious serious virus which ran counter to their efforts to downplay the virus. @POTUS &amp; GOP put politics over health. https://t.co/M51HlnkYpM,2020-07-29 19:25:32,Twitter for iPhone,3113,9509

-@CIA has assessed Russia paid money to people to kill US troops  -Russian hackers targeted #COVID19 research centers  -Russia is spreading Covid19 disinformation in the US  And @realDonaldTrump still cannot utter 1 sentence condemning Putin.

Dear @realDonaldTrump: Your duty is to protect our troops not make excuses for Russia. You need to stop Russia from paying money to kill US troops &amp; condemn Putin.

I’m a science fiction fan so when I saw Alien DNA trending I was intrigued.

AG Barr may want to study up on what any first year law student is taught.

Biggest problem with Mueller investigation is they didn’t make the call on whether Trump committed felonies and whether he should be indicted. They shirked that responsibility &amp; allowed Trump’s AG to decide which went against the whole point of a special counsel investigation. https://t.co/eO6SolmYPm,2020-07-14 04:42:20,Twitter for iPhone,4557,18325
One reason @realDonaldTrump’s disapproval is so high? Because more &amp; more Republicans and Independents and their family &amp; friends have been affected by #Covid_19. They know doctors &amp; @CDCgov &amp; Dr. Fauci are telling the truth. And they know testing still sucks in many places. https://t.co/kq9xVslBK2,2020-07-13 19:03:17,Twitter for iPhone,974,3021
To the professionals at @CDCgov:   @realDonaldTrump retweeted a Chuck Woolery statement that said you’re lying. I’m sorry @POTUS chose to stab you in the back during a pandemic. Dems have your back.

@BenRevenge @realDonaldTrump Thank you for reading my post. Here are 3 differences. Most pollsters aren’t stupid. A number have adjusted their polling based on 2016. Second Trump is the incumbent.

If you still support him what does that say about you?  #TuesdayThoughts https://t.co/Mrr1uu2Zll,2020-07-07 20:57:41,Twitter for iPhone,956,3481
The @WhiteHouse &amp; @GOP are more concerned about who told the American people that Russia paid bounties to Taliban to kill US troops than about actually responding to Russia.  The fact that @realDonaldTrump still hasn’t condemned Vladimir Putin is treasonous behavior. https://t.co/eHW6mv4AYS,2020-07-07 20:23:17,Twitter for iPhone,3793,8720
@caliufohvnt @SecAzar I sure hope so but the data suggests that based on the time lag between new cases and deaths we will likely see an increase in deaths in a few weeks.,2020-07-07 20:07:34,Twitter for iPhone,3,4
Dear @SecAzar: I agree it’s a worthy goal to reopen schools. But need to base it on facts. How do you social distance a classroom? Would you need more teachers to reduce class sizes? Will 3rd graders wear masks? Schools ARE different. (Also healthcare workers do get infected). https://t.co/07QlSSy4yM,2020-07-07 20:03:24,Twitter for iPhone,1410,4485

Dear @realDonaldTrump: Multiple hospitals are running out of ICU beds not because of testing but because many Americans are seriously ill from #COVIDー19.

@Catmomma13 @realDonaldTrump @GOP @POTUS So here’s the thing. When hospitals get overwhelmed by Covid patients it affects everyone.

Hello @RichardGrenell did you have a chance to review the below two questions? Thank you for your prior responses. https://t.co/NCt2AaSBNi,2020-06-28 17:52:49,Twitter for iPhone,635,2257
@vancemurphy @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Hmmm who tweeted that White Power video? Let me check my notes. Nope it wasn’t someone from the left.,2020-06-28 17:30:45,Twitter for iPhone,19,84
@JeffreySKlein1 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump It’s also still Russia. White House has not denied Russia paid bounties to militants to kill US troops.,2020-06-28 17:29:31,Twitter for iPhone,9,13
@Truth33truth @POTUS @realDonaldTrump The current case fatality rate in the United States based on the data is approximately 4.9%.  https://t.co/pnAG48iZMo,2020-06-28 17:27:37,Twitter for iPhone,6,12
The President is a racist. @POTUS has made multiple racist statements and taken racist actions. Many Independents Democrats and some Republicans who supported Trump in 2016 no longer support him.  If you continue to support @realDonaldTrump what does that say about you? https://t.co/ydqcvS4Twf,2020-06-28 17:24:39,Twitter for iPhone,2085,6710
Thank you @RollingStone for accurately describing @realDonaldTrump. Other media organizations should take note. Not calling @POTUS a racist is simply inaccurate. https://t.co/rWVjiQJy3q,2020-06-28 16:59:54,Twitter for iPhone,3284,10198
It has been two days and @realDonaldTrump and his Administration still have NOT denied the specific allegation—confirmed by multiple press reports—that Russia paid militants to kill US troops in Afghanistan. And instead of confronting Putin what did @POTUS do? He went golfing. https://t.co/7Zxe3Oq89l,2020-06-28 16:46:16,Twitter for iPhone,3286,8799
Today is Sunday. That means @realDonaldTrump is doing more racist stuff.  #SundayMorning Thoughts https://t.co/o5Evd92KWn,2020-06-28 16:06:56,Twitter for iPhone,799,3560
This is a fascinating statement by @realDonaldTrump. No one is saying Russians attacked US troops. The multiple press reports state Russia paid bounties for militants to kill US troops. Did @POTUS intentionally misdescribe what Russia did in order to deny it?  #SundayThoughts https://t.co/cMSDs5Y0O8,2020-06-28 15:41:25,Twitter for iPhone,5833,17935
Dear @ODNIgov &amp; @PressSec: When you say “briefed” do you mean only verbally by a briefer which is the word game the @realDonaldTrump Administration has apparently used in the past?  Was any of the Russian bounty information contained in the written President’s Daily Brief? https://t.co/7x4J297aCq,2020-06-28 07:43:27,Twitter for iPhone,1417,4392
Dear @RichardGrenell: Thank you for responding to my questions. Is the below statement false that the Russian bounty information was included in the President’s Daily Brief?  Also did you at any time receive information that the Russians offered bounties for killing US troops? https://t.co/AZ0twTZsgy,2020-06-28 07:29:01,Twitter for iPhone,995,2968
@nazidemocrats @ODNIgov @realDonaldTrump I served on active duty in the United States military to defend your right to say stupid racist stuff.  Also our oldest son is a black belt so there’s that.,2020-06-28 06:46:59,Twitter for iPhone,16,90
@fadde @ODNIgov @realDonaldTrump No,2020-06-28 06:43:39,Twitter for iPhone,12,201
Either @ODNIgov Ratcliffe &amp; former DNI Grenell are lying or professional intel officials made the incomprehensible choice of withholding explosive info from @realDonaldTrump.  My bet? In the famous words of Amb Sondland “everyone knew” and “everyone was in the loop.” https://t.co/AZ0twTZsgy,2020-06-28 06:33:43,Twitter for iPhone,3568,10180
This statement from @ODNIgov if true points to another scandal: intelligence officials withholding explosive information from @POTUS.  Also @realDonaldTrump knew yesterday about the news that Russia paid bounties to kill US troops. His response? He went golfing today. https://t.co/Kou3oKKR2c,2020-06-28 04:18:11,Twitter for iPhone,2813,7813
Dear @SecPompeo and Secretary @EsperDoD: Were any of you briefed that Russia paid bounties for the killing of US troops in Afghanistan?  I note the Administration has repeatedly NOT denied that Russia paid militants to kill Americans. https://t.co/7x4J297aCq,2020-06-28 04:02:23,Twitter for iPhone,1864,5517
Thank you @RichardGrenell but the @WhiteHouse response suggests the story is true. White House doesn’t deny that Russia paid bounties for the killing of US Troops. Instead @PressSec basically says you didn’t brief @POTUS and @VP. Why would she say that? https://t.co/swe6CuIjfu,2020-06-28 03:06:37,Twitter for iPhone,2728,9670
Thank you @RichardGrenell for your response. The @nytimes story was confirmed by Wash Post &amp; WSJ. Today @CNN reports European intel official also confirms story. If you are telling the truth why doesn’t White House deny bounty story instead of saying you didn’t brief @POTUS? https://t.co/jdYwcolE93,2020-06-28 02:52:07,Twitter for iPhone,8896,29413
Dear @realDonaldTrump: When are you going to disinvite Vladimir Putin from the G7 Summit and when are you going to impose sanctions against Russia?  Also why do you always bend the knee when it comes to Russia?   cc: @SecPompeo https://t.co/WxveG4AD3d,2020-06-27 23:05:54,Twitter for iPhone,2756,7342
Dear @RichardGrenell: Did you really not tell @realDonaldTrump and @VP Pence that Russia was paying militants to kill US troops?   Or is @PressSec lying? https://t.co/V4FadEuiPt,2020-06-27 22:43:14,Twitter for iPhone,9162,26010
The statement by White House @PressSec does not deny Russia paid bounties to militants to kill US troops.  It’s also hard to believe her statement is true. But if it is then we would expect @realDonaldTrump to immediately disinvite Putin from the G7 Summit &amp; impose sanctions. https://t.co/2NW5xjrtOY,2020-06-27 22:28:07,Twitter for iPhone,2548,7536

Everyone in this picture is a patriot with one exception. @realDonaldTrump apparently knew Putin paid bounties to militants to kill US troops &amp; POTUS did nothing.

Yesterday the @nytimes reported and Wash Post &amp; WSJ confirmed the explosive story that (1) Russia paid bounties for militants to kill US troops in Afghanistan &amp; (2) @realDonaldTrump knew but did nothing.  I note @POTUS has not denied the allegations. He’s focused on TV ratings. https://t.co/es3SSak7sg,2020-06-27 15:29:21,Twitter for iPhone,9299,23555
“The United States concluded months ago that the Russian unit...had covertly offered rewards for successful attacks last year.

If true this is outrageous conduct by Russia. Lack of a response by @realDonaldTrump suggests he may be beholden to Putin. @POTUS is putting US troops’ lives at risk by doing nothing. Having served on active duty I find this behavior by our Commander in Chief to be unacceptable. https://t.co/RbHpVRpqrT,2020-06-26 20:40:34,Twitter for iPhone,7472,17174

My view of why Biden is crushing Trump: overwhelming majority of Americans (1) don’t like @realDonaldTrump’s racism &amp; (2) we don’t believe our lives are expendable in a pandemic.

Bill Barr will not investigate himself. But we on @HouseJudiciary can and will investigate him.

The @WhiteHouse KNEW jobs report was wrong and still set up a press conference with @realDonaldTrump touting it. How do we know? Because the report itself says the agency misclassified workers who should have counted as unemployed.

@GM062616 @RepClayHiggins Wrong. Both the Trump Administration’s Surgeon General &amp; CDC urge Americans to wear masks in public. The issue is stopping your saliva droplets.

The executive order by @realDonaldTrump cannot change the law or the Constitution. Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act is what allows Trump to post his deranged thoughts on social media.

And now he keeps making the same mistake by promoting through his actions that masks are unimportant.  #wednesdaymorning thoughts https://t.co/xR5v21Yxyf,2020-05-06 17:49:47,Twitter for iPhone,1023,3232

Dear @WhiteHouseCEA: WOW you apparently fail to understand that @IHME_UW changes its curve to match the data coming in. So of course their mortality curves will always match the data. But in terms of prediction the model was way off. It got 60k deaths &amp; then 72k deaths wrong. https://t.co/CKxt88f66o,2020-05-05 20:18:04,Twitter for iPhone,233,658

The overwhelming majority of the American people understand that this pandemic is first &amp; foremost a public health crisis.

Below fact is another reason the @IHME_UW model is so stupid. It magically declares that the virus goes away completely on Aug 4. That’s what their ridiculous chart shows.

The @IHME_UW model got 60k deaths wrong. It then revised to 72k deaths. That’s also wrong. Their third revision is also likely wrong. Model assumes virus goes away in August.

We can significantly reduce the number of Americans who get seriously ill or die if we had enough testing.

Dear @SenRickScott: I agree with you. Can you tell @realDonaldTrump Administration and @senatemajldr McConnell to stop trying to jam through PPP funding without changes to the law?  This is one reason Dems blocked a clean PPP; we need to first make it better before refunding it. https://t.co/yYgY2RI6OP,2020-04-20 20:21:42,Twitter for iPhone,798,2564

Dear @realDonaldTrump: Your Administration created the initial faulty tests. Then your agencies set restrictive initial testing criteria that no one coming from Europe got tested. And you downplayed the virus.  Stop lying to the American people and get us the tests you promised. https://t.co/1ftQ7Wu6SV,2020-04-20 06:34:06,Twitter for iPhone,7060,19788
Dear @POTUS &amp; @VP: Multiple Governors and hospitals are saying the federal government has seized protective equipment they ordered.

In addition to a higher mortality rate than the flu #COVID19 causes about 15% of those infected to be hospitalized because they are gasping for air or have organ damage. This is why we have to reopen safely. Businesses can’t operate if their workers keep getting hospitalized. https://t.co/ESP4Bs2URT,2020-04-19 21:41:51,Twitter for iPhone,896,2781

I agree with the approach outlined below. We can’t fix our economy without first being able to detect &amp; constrain #COVIDー19.

Dear @realDonaldTrump: The reason we now have approximately 40000 cases of #COVIDー19 is because the virus didn’t primarily come through our borders with Mexico or Canada.

This is a stupid clash. At end of 15-day period many Americans still won’t want to fly go on cruise ship sit next to stranger at movie theater or eat at crowded restaurant.

Dear @realDonaldTrump: Here’s the problem. After 15 days people still would not want to go on a cruise ship fly sit at a crowded restaurant etc. This behavior change will slow our economy for a long time.

Half a million masks to New York is not enough.

Thank you @stltoday for your editorial.  I wish @realDonaldTrump would stop causing fear in the Asian American community &amp; distracting us from this crisis. We all need to work together.   https://t.co/02CiFBPqx2,2020-03-20 00:51:52,Twitter for iPhone,1062,3798
Dear @realDonaldTrump: I agree with you we are at war with a hidden enemy #COVID19. You’ve likened yourself to a wartime president. We need the ammo to fight #coronavirus. Please use the Defense Production Act to get it.  You alone can fix it. No one else can invoke the Act. https://t.co/gvL9WkpkBv,2020-03-19 21:12:20,Twitter for iPhone,1684,4959
I spoke with a LA County medical official &amp; the test data reflects tests from 4-6 days ago due to the backlog to process the already limited number of tests. Be prepared for the numbers to continue to increase exponentially. That’s why everyone needs to do social distancing NOW. https://t.co/jpEg23BYe9,2020-03-19 20:51:31,Twitter for iPhone,782,1792
Dear @POTUS: Governors cannot invoke the Defense Production Act to get protective equipment to hospitals and first responders. You alone can fix it. https://t.co/92IgZnAl5P,2020-03-19 19:07:54,Twitter for iPhone,4548,12395

@XC11488 The difference is the vote is public. So let’s say my vote is manipulated by a hacker and changed from a yes to a no. I will know because there will be a public roll call published of the votes relatively quickly.,2020-03-19 17:49:29,Twitter for iPhone,2,3
Dear @realDonaldTrump: In a life threatening pandemic no job should be too small for the Federal Govt. We need to be the shipping contracting ordering providing &amp; funding clerk to fill in the gaps.  Please use your powers under the Defense Production Act. Lives are at stake. https://t.co/JaRFpGZjoO,2020-03-19 17:29:38,Twitter for iPhone,2556,6871
House should do the same:  1. Presidential guidelines say all Americans should work from home whenever possible; it’s possible to vote remotely 2. Several Members already in quarantine or tested positive 3. Many Members in high risk groups 4. We can act quicker with remote voting https://t.co/axDHSw8g5r,2020-03-19 17:07:52,Twitter for iPhone,478,1635
Dear @realDonaldTrump: Asian Americans have already been assaulted &amp; you are increasing that risk because of your unhelpful rhetoric.  What would help is test kits. LA County has limited availability &amp; it can take up to 6 days to get test results. When can you get us more tests? https://t.co/pe110fxYrD,2020-03-19 16:09:05,Twitter for iPhone,3348,11690
@KamVTV Do you love that Asian Americans have been assaulted because of that kind of unnecessary language?,2020-03-19 16:04:25,Twitter for iPhone,7,34
Dear @KellyannePolls: I also happen to be married to an Asian American. And she is at higher risk of being assaulted because of unnecessary rhetoric by @realDonaldTrump. Can you please tell your boss to stop using xenophobic language.  Also our hospitals need test kits. Thanks. https://t.co/rQGkB68vhY,2020-03-19 06:55:10,Twitter for iPhone,8705,38093
Dear @realDonaldTrump: Your tweet will lead to more discrimination against Americans who happen to be of Asian descent. Please stop dividing Americans.  Also can you please use Act below to get protective equipment to hospitals? I spoke to ER doc who said they will soon run out. https://t.co/L0royEvl1a,2020-03-19 04:25:40,Twitter for iPhone,3008,11303
Dear @megynkelly: I agree we need to focus on what needs to be done such as increasing testing and getting protective equipment to hospitals &amp; first responders.  Also we need to mitigate number of Asian Americans getting assaulted because of rhetoric like that used by Trump. https://t.co/BFzOMjNNQZ,2020-03-19 04:05:25,Twitter for iPhone,1278,6871
Dear @VP: Thank you for chairing WH Coronavirus task force. LA County Fire Dept informed me they will soon run out of protective equipment to handle #COVID19 patients. I understand this is a nationwide problem. Can you let me know your plan to solve it &amp; how Congress can help? https://t.co/vaqJ9ONU3p,2020-03-19 02:32:26,Twitter for iPhone,1528,4365
Dear @ChuckGrassley: Multiple Asian Americans have been assaulted and discriminated against because of the type of language below. And the unnecessary language doesn’t help us solve the pandemic facing us. Americans are dying. Can we please just focus on solving this crisis? https://t.co/AJHF37YQqn,2020-03-18 23:48:13,Twitter for iPhone,4184,16336
Dear @WhiteHouse: This virus has an official name Covid-19 and an unofficial name Coronavirus. Your language will cause more discrimination against Asian Americans.  What would help is if you can get hospitals &amp; first responders much more test kits &amp; protective equipment. https://t.co/BrMvEjABfO,2020-03-18 21:33:40,Twitter for iPhone,7337,27648
@ClementeJose @realDonaldTrump How does your language help us solve the current crisis?,2020-03-18 17:29:13,Twitter for iPhone,9,200
Dear @realDonaldTrump: Your tweet will lead to more discrimination against Chinese Americans &amp; is not helpful to solving the #COVID19 crisis. What would help is if you use Defense Production Act &amp; get protective equipment to hospitals &amp; first responders. They will soon run out. https://t.co/bpqPeBJ8x5,2020-03-18 16:25:50,Twitter for iPhone,4364,17323
@lucasthorpe @realDonaldTrump Thank you for sharing. Containment can work but the fact that this virus can be spread by people with no symptoms makes it difficult to execute. Hopefully China has shown it can be done but we won’t know for awhile if the virus resurges again in China. https://t.co/WXgxFJ0jJU,2020-03-18 07:48:57,Twitter for iPhone,25,101
@josh_wingrove @SalehaMohsin @JenniferJJacobs @TheTerminal Still far too small to address the actual problem. https://t.co/AOGMkQat1m https://t.co/WlEYHGQvuT,2020-03-18 07:35:26,Twitter for iPhone,18,49
I urge everyone to read the Imperial College study on #COVID19 &amp; this thread below which summarizes it. Upshot is we will need to sustain Americans for a year or more until we get a validated vaccine. Stimulus plan by @realDonaldTrump is way too small. Need to triple it. https://t.co/glr7oU9NT6,2020-03-18 07:34:08,Twitter for iPhone,3642,8544
Kansas Governor Kelly understands the #coronavirus crisis will not end in a few weeks. https://t.co/QfgWDTYzyR,2020-03-18 06:29:55,Twitter for iPhone,385,1743
I agree with @Scaramucci that the stimulus proposal by @realDonaldTrump is far too small and too short. This is not a weeks-long crisis it is not a months-long crisis. It is a year-long crisis because we won’t have a validated vaccine available to the general public for a year. https://t.co/54w2dqflXI,2020-03-18 05:18:09,Twitter for iPhone,2795,9400
At beginning of March we had around 70 #COVID2019 cases. Today it’s over 5000 because the virus spreads exponentially. Based on math number of cases will exceed 100000 by end of March IF we don’t do any social distancing. This is why everyone needs to do social distancing. https://t.co/CVVPu0JBwc,2020-03-18 01:32:45,Twitter for iPhone,1843,4616
More evidence below of why we need a bigger and longer stimulus plan from @realDonaldTrump. #Coronavirus is not a weeks-long crisis. It’s a year-long crisis until we get a vaccine. I will be pushing in Congress for a stimulus plan that can sustain Americans for at least a year. https://t.co/FWVikfakFE,2020-03-18 00:03:54,Twitter for iPhone,1334,4143
@ktlin60 We know how serious it will get based on projections and what we are seeing in Italy and Spain.,2020-03-17 23:41:33,Twitter for iPhone,2,14
@andretti69 I’m not being optimistic. I’m presenting a choice. We can go back to normal in a few weeks. That also means millions will die later this year based on the projections that caused Trump to shift his tone on this crisis.,2020-03-17 23:40:35,Twitter for iPhone,6,25
@VBerg4 A validated vaccine according to @NIH expert Dr. Fauci is 12-18 months away. There are multiple levels of clinical trials. I’ve kept up.,2020-03-17 23:38:01,Twitter for iPhone,3,25
Why do we need a stimulus plan that sustains Americans for a year? Because “silent spreaders” will cause #coronavirus to spike again once social distancing stops. Only way to solve this is a vaccine which is 1 year away. We need to think about this as a year-long crisis. https://t.co/ii9RMGQeMS,2020-03-17 23:31:24,Twitter for iPhone,1294,3871
@strat58cat @AndrewYang Yes but the question is for how long do we flatten the curve? Once we lift the restrictions the virus will spread again because there is no immunity.,2020-03-17 22:05:32,Twitter for iPhone,4,27
The stimulus proposed by @WhiteHouse is far too small &amp; too short. Because this is a new virus &amp; there is no immunity the crisis will not go away until we have a validated vaccine. That’s 1 year away. Any stimulus must provide sustained support for Americans for at least a year. https://t.co/4wghlpjxcN,2020-03-17 21:48:18,Twitter for iPhone,713,2043
I agree with @realDonaldTrump #coronavirus is a hidden enemy. Best way to find it? Testing. This is why we need to dramatically increase the currently insufficient testing. We also need to work with other countries such as China to solve the testing reagent shortage. https://t.co/z3frdZxOxO,2020-03-17 21:16:06,Twitter for iPhone,966,4866
Dear @VP Pence: Thank you for your service. A shortage of reagents is hampering the already limited amount of tests available. Can you let me know what is your plan and how we can help? Here is a letter we sent your office. https://t.co/dB9D9q6hK7  @GavinNewsom @CountyofLA https://t.co/GkxHmEnGfh,2020-03-17 20:36:15,Twitter for iPhone,1233,2646
This article shows why the stimulus plan proposed by @realDonaldTrump is far too small. Because there is no immunity this crisis does not go away in weeks. We need to think about supporting Americans for many many months to a year until we get a validated vaccine.  #FactsMatter https://t.co/IglT6pEX8G,2020-03-17 19:51:37,Twitter for iPhone,951,2903
Dear @EsperDoD: Thank you. https://t.co/iEW6VauNah,2020-03-17 19:29:24,Twitter for iPhone,454,2196
I look forward to working with @WhiteHouse on a stimulus plan. Need to emphasize again that the Administration’s plan is too small. Because there is no immunity to #COVID2019 this crisis will not go away in weeks. We need to reorient to a time period of many months to a year. https://t.co/TZUudj9eo9,2020-03-17 19:08:26,Twitter for iPhone,306,1220
@gerardbush That’s one issue. I don’t have a great answer to it in the short term before a vaccine gets validated.,2020-03-17 18:35:39,Twitter for iPhone,2,10
A good explanation of why we must take strong social distancing actions. But one upshot is that because there is no immunity #COVID2019 will spike again if these actions go away. We need to stop thinking about this crisis in terms of weeks. We need to reorient to months or more. https://t.co/hBsyq11Gpx,2020-03-17 18:31:13,Twitter for iPhone,443,1033
@jmenicucci @WhiteHouse Is that because you don’t believe Trump who said it is very contagious or is it you don’t believe Dr. Fauci who says mortality rate is 10 times higher than the flu?,2020-03-17 18:09:24,Twitter for iPhone,5,21
Pleased @WhiteHouse wants to do economic stimulus. But this is far too small. Until a vaccine is validated which is a year away major sectors of the US &amp; world economy will still be slowed or shutdown. For example would you go to a movie theater in 6 months without a vaccine? https://t.co/B2arqShwqC,2020-03-17 18:02:22,Twitter for iPhone,537,1685
@yaneerbaryam Unlike the flu there is no immunity to this virus. That means once we stop the lockdowns the virus will grow again. Until a vaccine is developed multiple sectors will continue to suffer. Would you for example go to a movie 6 months from now?,2020-03-17 17:44:54,Twitter for iPhone,4,10
Good to see support for stimulus. However everything being talked about is FAR TOO SMALL. We are looking at a US and worldwide economic shutdown of multiple sectors for MANY MONTHS TO A YEAR. Our economy is about $21.5 trillion. We need a stimulus of at least $2 trillion. https://t.co/PpwBOgixoF,2020-03-17 17:35:30,Twitter for iPhone,841,2562
Dear @VP: Thank you for working on this crisis. Can you please get more ventilators? Do you need anything from Congress to make this happen? Thanks. https://t.co/z8jwKeX973,2020-03-17 17:14:03,Twitter for iPhone,2689,8216

Can you please stop this unnecessary language? We all need to work together. https://t.co/9p9SE7xBGv,2020-03-17 16:38:50,Twitter for iPhone,7168,32111

@TiaCarra @WhiteHouse Actually it’s not. And it’s growing exponentially with a death rate currently near 20 times that of the flu. The actions being taken are to mitigate what the scary projections look like one month from now.,2020-03-17 16:02:31,Twitter for iPhone,5,17
Dear @WhiteHouse: We are in an unprecedented health crisis. All Americans are at risk from #coronavirus which does not discriminate. The next few months will be very difficult for our nation.

The spread of #COVID2019 in America has been exponential just like the experts predicted. Current mortality rate of #coronavirus is more than 10 times that of the flu just like the experts predicted.
