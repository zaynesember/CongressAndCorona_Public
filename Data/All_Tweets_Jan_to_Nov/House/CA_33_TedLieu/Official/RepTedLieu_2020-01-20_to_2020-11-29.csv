During Gun Violence Survivors Week we're urging Leader McConnell to bring up #HR8 for a vote. The House passed this bipartisan bill to expand background checks nearly a year ago.

Because of Trump’s #RemainInMexico just .01% of asylum seekers are reaching safety. Before this dehumanizing process 20% were granted asylum in the US. This policy isn't normal.
