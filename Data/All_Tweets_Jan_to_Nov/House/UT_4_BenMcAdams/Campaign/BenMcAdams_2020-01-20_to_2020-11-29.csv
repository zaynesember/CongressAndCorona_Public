@JeffMcAdamTV @RepBenMcAdams I should add for the benefit of anyone not in on the inside joke @JeffMcAdamTV and I are not related. It didn’t stop this elected official from trying to get favorable coverage from him as a journalist when he was in Utah. Sadly he never gave me anything but fair treatment. 🤷‍♂️,2020-07-22 03:14:24,Twitter for iPhone,0,1

I had to get a Covid test in advance of a medical checkup. I thought I’d share what it’s like. It’s been three months since I was in the hospital with Covid-19. As expected the test was negative. If you have symptoms please get tested. The test isn’t as bad as it looks. #utpol https://t.co/B5NOj3GKdp,2020-07-06 20:38:12,Twitter for iPhone,42,375

It’s West Bountiful Utah 1976. My hometown and two years after I was born. It’s changed a lot since then but I still remember when it looked like it does in the painting. Thanks for asking.

@poppopdst @RepBenMcAdams There’s so much we don’t know about this virus and antibody response so my doctor encouraged me to wear one even though it’s probably an abundance of caution. I also think it’s important to ‘walk the walk’  when we are asking everyone else to wear a mask in public places.,2020-04-23 01:42:02,Twitter for iPhone,1,15
@jceron12 @KathHL @HeardontheHill I’m new to this facial hair thing so I’m as curious for a response as you are.  And what is the purpose of either an oil or a balm?

I learned to cut hair for the first and probably last time. Also these kids insist it’s not true but I’m pretty sure these quarantine cuts mean they’ve had their hair cut more than they’ve showered since we’ve been hunkered down. #utpol https://t.co/bu84T7Zqhl,2020-04-20 03:06:40,Twitter for iPhone,5,169

@dvs1444 @RepBenMcAdams I’ve gotten to know Bill well. Nice guy. Really smart.

@dvs1444 @RepBenMcAdams It was the last physics class I took at the University of Utah. My professor was David Alion.
