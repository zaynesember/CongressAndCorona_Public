Unreasonable at best and unnecessarily cruel at its worst.  Why can’t the parents of 120 student athletes socially distance in a stadium with more than 50000 seats @RoyCooperNC? https://t.co/VEVOnVeUug,2020-09-10 22:27:48,Twitter Web App,96,238

Barring parents from attending their kids' @UNC games in an empty 51000-seat stadium because of a 50-person outdoor mass gathering restriction is illogical ridiculous and a gross mismanagement of policies supposedly put in place for our state’s safety.  https://t.co/J0Cj0SZ6lI,2020-09-10 20:37:43,Twitter Web App,35,63
