It's true.  When floods came to #IA03 Cindy Axne not only rolled up her sleeves and helped get $3 billion for Midwest flooding - she worked on bipartisan legislation to improve resiliency for communities hit hardest.  https://t.co/NXLDUAc8a0,2020-10-18 23:55:42,Twitter Web App,6,14
Cindy Axne is the fighter we need for Iowa's economy and its workers.   Don't take it from us take it from the @USChamber of Commerce:   Cindy Axne's “continued leadership in Congress will...work to restore economic growth and expand opportunities for all Americans.”   #IA03 https://t.co/bcM3Qb54cO,2020-10-18 23:52:10,Twitter Web App,11,24
Cindy is committed to expanding access to affordable quality health care for every Iowan.

Did David Young just say "they know what they're getting" by supporting him?  @DMRegister certainly agreed: "Iowans should not forget why they booted Young from office.

When I hear stories like this one I think about my 2 boys.  I’m heartbroken just thinking of the difficulty families like Adam’s would face without existing protections for their children's health conditions.  NO family should be faced with that challenge period. (2/3),2020-10-15 18:06:30,Twitter Web App,1,8
Iowans like Adam – and so many other parents of children w/ pre-existing conditions – need to know that their family’s access to health care is secure.  #IA03HealthcareStories like his drive home what’s at stake for our kids &amp; families in this election. #IA03 (1/3) https://t.co/lru5dftsiq,2020-10-15 18:04:24,Twitter Media Studio,10,27

FACT CHECK: False  David Young is once again falling back on false attacks about Cindy Axne's record of showing up for Iowa.  Who called it false?  The hosts of tonight's #IA03 debate.  https://t.co/KVTqSZHQTa https://t.co/Nua18OQHOx,2020-10-13 00:30:53,Twitter Web App,8,18
When asked about David Young's record of standing up to his party he touted his work on a bill that the experts called "devastating."  That's not the record that Iowans want from their congressional representation.  #IA03 https://t.co/gnqqGtiqSN,2020-10-13 00:28:22,Twitter Web App,9,14
Cindy is a small business owner &amp; a champion for Iowa’s businesses and workers.

It's true.  Of Iowa's six representatives and senators in Congress the @USChamber said Cindy Axne is Iowa's  🚨 most bipartisan member of congress 🚨  #IA03 https://t.co/c2BKstV0Il,2020-10-07 21:51:11,Twitter Web App,9,35
Here's what the @USChamber told Cindy when they endorsed her: "you continued leadership in Congress will benefit the nation as we combat the coronavirus work to restore economic growth and expand opportunities for all Americans."  https://t.co/gKoC0UHMq8,2020-10-07 21:45:57,Twitter Web App,2,8
Actually Cindy only brought up the @USChamber's score card - but a helpful reminder from David Young that:  CINDY AXNE IS ENDORSED BY THE US CHAMBER OF COMMERCE   Cindy is a small business owner and a champion for Iowa’s businesses and workers. #IA03 https://t.co/Hus01aeeJW,2020-10-07 21:45:57,Twitter Web App,3,9
Did you know?  Over 75% of Cindy Axne's votes this Congress were bipartisan.  That's the independent voice Iowa needs in Washington.  #IA03 https://t.co/pBLde6HDop,2020-10-07 21:44:11,Twitter Web App,5,13
David Young's record on health care was devastating for Iowa's families.  That's the experts' opinion.  Why does David Young think he knows better than the experts?  #IA03 https://t.co/i8SOkdyZ5o,2020-10-07 21:37:42,Twitter Web App,9,9
FACT CHECK: True  For months Cindy has pushed congressional leadership and the White House to meet in the middle on a compromise package that could deliver aid for Iowans and help combat #COVID19.  #IA03  https://t.co/IifRoWHBO2,2020-10-07 21:33:11,Twitter Web App,3,10
Led the charge on health care David?  Health care experts disagree.  In fact folks like the AARP American Medical Association American Cancer Society - and many other health care experts – have said that David Young's votes on health care were dangerous for Iowans. #IA03 https://t.co/KBodIbGVtS,2020-10-07 21:25:36,Twitter Web App,8,17
TRIVIA: Who is the only candidate in tonight’s debate that repeatedly voted to:  ❌ gut protections for pre-existing conditions ❌ privatize Medicare ❌ raise the costs of prescription drugs for Iowa’s seniors  ?   Here’s a clue: It’s not Cindy Axne. #IA03,2020-10-07 21:21:31,Twitter Web App,11,36

Wow David Young can't even get through a 2 minute introduction of himself without lying about Cindy's record of showing up for Iowa.  It's almost like he's afraid of talking about his own record in Congress. #IA03   https://t.co/KVTqSZHQTa https://t.co/kVcukxNKDV,2020-10-07 21:06:05,Twitter Web App,3,10

In last night’s first #IA03 debate folks were reminded that health care is on the ballot this election –– and also why Iowans are right to be worried about my opponent’s voting record. https://t.co/DwBzRvqrkV,2020-10-06 23:52:25,Twitter Web App,30,49
Honored to have the endorsement of @ActiveRetirees – which represents more than 4.4 million of our retirees and older citizens.  Every Iowan deserves not only the secure retirement they’ve earned – but also lower drug costs and quality affordable health care.  #IA03 https://t.co/lKlKPr63KM,2020-10-06 21:18:01,Twitter Web App,7,19
Had a great time talking with @BrentRoske about the issues that matter to Iowans in #IA03 this election:    ☑️ protecting &amp; expanding health care access ☑️  supporting our economy &amp; creating good-paying jobs ☑️  holding government accountable to Iowa's taxpayers https://t.co/gROjuCMVrD,2020-10-06 16:45:47,Twitter Web App,4,13

COMPARE THE RECORDS:  When David Young’s party threatened to pull their funding over their disastrous health care bill Young fell in line and sold out Iowans.  When Cindy Axne’s party wanted to stop funding for farm aid programs she told them no &amp; made them change it.  #IA03,2020-10-06 01:54:12,Twitter Web App,36,105
David Young: "That's not true"  Fact Check: Oh it's true  The 2017 GOP tax bill kicked open the door to cuts to Social Security and Medicare. #IA03  https://t.co/r9iGxPAXPs,2020-10-06 01:36:17,Twitter Web App,13,40
As a small business owner and fifth generation Iowan supporting our businesses and workers isn’t just on her agenda – – –  it IS her agenda. #IA03,2020-10-06 01:32:44,Twitter Web App,8,17
Fact Check: TRUE  ❌ David Young put tax breaks for wealthy corporations ahead of protecting Iowa jobs &amp; middle class.   ✅ Cindy Axne got multiple taxes on the health care of Iowa’s middle class repealed wrote bills to protect Iowa jobs from outsourcing &amp; expand opportunity.,2020-10-06 01:32:43,Twitter Web App,14,52
✅  Flood relief for Iowans ✅  A long overdue renewal of the biodiesel tax credit ✅  Multiple repealed health care taxes   These all happened thanks to Cindy Axne the Most Accessible Freshman Member of Congress showing up and fighting for Iowans across #IA03.,2020-10-06 01:29:03,Twitter Web App,13,25
And the moral of this story is: you can’t trust David Young’s promise to protect Iowans’ health care.  Who can you trust?  @Axne4Congress   #IA03,2020-10-06 01:19:21,Twitter Web App,6,25
FLASHBACK: Back in 2017:  David Young said he’d oppose his party’s bill to cut health care.  But then his party threatened to pull their campaign donations.  So he sold out #IA03 and voted for the bill after all!,2020-10-06 01:19:21,Twitter Web App,17,79
David Young Protecting Iowans’ Care?   Fact Check: FALSE  Young has repeatedly voted to ❌ gut protections for pre-existing conditions ❌ privatize Medicare ❌ raise premiums on thousands of Iowa families.  #IA03,2020-10-06 01:16:03,Twitter Web App,21,64
Cindy has a clear record of showing up and fighting for Iowans across #IA03.   After her first year the @townhallproject named her the Most Accessible Freshman Member of Congress.  https://t.co/RzS39e00RC,2020-10-06 01:13:59,Twitter Web App,23,97

As we continue responding to #COVID19 &amp; its economic fallout this is the WORST POSSIBLE MOMENT to gut critical health care protections.

As #COVID19 continues to spread in Iowa refusing to budge on additional relief won't help the families &amp; communities still in need.   After pushing for a revised aid package we're closer than we've been in months – and we need to reach a deal ASAP. #IA03 https://t.co/kSkFEBwVd0 https://t.co/3i0D4EscxW,2020-10-03 16:24:57,Twitter Web App,1,9

I know from experience how stressful medical bills &amp; dealing w/ insurance can be for a family.

Rebuilding our economy amid the #COVID19 crisis shouldn’t be about tax breaks for big corporations – or cutting Medicare &amp; Social Security benefits.  It should be about putting Iowa’s middle-class families first.  #IA03 https://t.co/VTdqN0iLR6,2020-09-29 17:12:40,Twitter Media Studio,4,18
In the middle of a public health crisis protecting Iowans’ access to quality affordable health care has to be a top priority.
