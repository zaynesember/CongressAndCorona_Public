I'm calling on @SpeakerPelosi to bring up a revised &amp; robust COVID-19 aid package when the House returns this week. #IA03 https://t.co/bCnu61ozld,2020-08-19 15:28:34,Twitter Web App,7,27
Less than 150 days ago we lost the first Iowan to #COVID19.  Now we mourn over 1000.  But these deaths cannot become just numbers to us.  They are our neighbors friends and cherished family members – and we must remember them all and fight this virus in their memory. #IA03 https://t.co/Kae8X2aw3w,2020-08-19 14:16:11,Twitter Web App,5,18
Without clear accountability and answers Iowans don’t know the risks and facts about COVID-19 in our state. We need Iowa officials to fix this problem and restore our confidence in data. (4/4)  #IA03  https://t.co/XQTztyetQA,2020-08-18 23:01:59,Twitter Web App,2,11
I have raised concerns previously with @IAGovernor about the inconsistencies of data on the state’s dashboard.   Now I’m calling on her administration to provide a clear report on this glitch – as well as proof that the glitch is fixed as soon as possible. (3/4),2020-08-18 23:01:59,Twitter Web App,3,21
Parents and teachers are using this data to determine how to safely reopen schools.   Assisted living facilities are using it to determine how to best protect their residents.   Iowa's small businesses are using it to determine how to safely serve their customers. (2/4),2020-08-18 23:01:59,Twitter Web App,2,9
This report on @IAPublicHealth's data is a gut punch.  This data is the foundation of all Iowa’s safety &amp; reopening decisions.   Iowans have been told to trust the data – and if it's inaccurate it has calamitous consequences for Iowa.   #IA03 (1/4) https://t.co/vdHMgL2FEd,2020-08-18 23:01:58,Twitter Web App,6,23

Countless communities in #IA03 like many rural areas across the U.S. rely heavily on @USPS for their needs.

While operational changes &amp; additional funding are still necessary to solve the crisis at the @USPS I have no faith that the current leadership can be trusted to undo the damage done.

I am grateful that @POTUS has quickly approved a portion of the disaster declaration but urge him to commit any &amp; all manpower necessary to complete approval of this aid.  Iowa families who've lost their homes power and harvests cannot afford any unnecessary delay. #IA03 (3/3),2020-08-18 15:38:41,Twitter Web App,1,17
It is unacceptable that portions of this federal aid are still under review including funds that will help Iowans deal with damage at their homes – especially as access to safe shelter remains a critical priority during #COVID19.

Stopped through the Ben Franklin general store in Winterset &amp; chatted with owners Dave &amp; Judy about maintaining a successful small business in rural Iowa.  Trips to our local Ben Franklin were a special treat when I was growing up &amp; theirs is one of the last four in Iowa! #IA03 https://t.co/unz9a4u1CU,2020-01-24 14:41:41,Twitter for iPhone,3,38

One woman from the class named Foos summed up the community that  the class has fostered for her: “they brought me in as one of their sisters.”   When hardworking Iowans come together to support one another our communities succeed. (2/2),2020-01-23 17:15:41,Twitter for iPhone,1,11

A little snow &amp; ice didn’t stop folks from coming to our Veterans Town Hall last night in Beaverdale.
