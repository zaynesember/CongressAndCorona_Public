As @HouseForeign Chair I am keenly aware of the despot playbook.

There’s no such thing as an acquittal when you don’t have a real trial. The Senate’s sham process was nothing more than an extension of the President’s coverup.

Yesterday I spoke with @NewYorkStakz in #Yonkers &amp; learned about his work raising awareness for #HBCUs. Historical Black Colleges &amp; Universities play a big role in education outreach. In September the House passed the FUTURES act which reauthorizes critical funding for HBCUs. https://t.co/JB7NACwDpA,2020-02-03 20:44:15,Twitter Web App,7,20
Had a wonderful time last night at @MindBuildersCAC’s 2020 Heroes Day Celebration in the #Bronx. https://t.co/AdggJ3O8Fd,2020-02-02 15:29:04,Twitter for iPhone,4,8
Last September I took the stage at the #GlobalCitizensFestival in NYC and talked about the need to pass the #KeepingGirlsInSchoolAct.   This critical bill helps empower women and girls globally &amp; I’m proud to say that this week it passed the U.S. House. @GlblCtznImpact @GlblCtzn https://t.co/X51l2YO01m,2020-02-01 16:17:19,Twitter Web App,3,15
We’re working hard on the case on behalf of the Hamza family.   Important to remember that the Trump Admin’s terrible separation policies aren’t just happening at the Southern border. https://t.co/YXDirfmAIk,2020-01-31 21:51:43,Twitter Web App,9,20
Trials have witnesses. Trials have evidence.   If Senate Republicans block testimony from Amb. Bolton and other new evidence it’s not a legitimate trial and the acquittal is meaningless. #WeWantWitnessesAndDocuments,2020-01-31 17:03:37,Twitter Web App,33,59
An administration certainly shouldn’t be twisting a decades-old authorization to justify plunging us into a war the American people don’t want—and that Congress hasn’t authorized.  Today I voted for a measure to repeal the 2002 Iraq AUMF. #StopEndlessWar https://t.co/B9cQtX8pND,2020-01-30 20:31:02,Twitter Web App,4,10
This is about upholding the Constitution. This is about checks and balances. We have really abdicated our responsibly and the time to stop that is now.  Now is the time for Congress to step up and assert our constitutional authority. #NoWarWithIran https://t.co/KgKgNP414Y,2020-01-30 19:30:02,Twitter Web App,4,16
I just led the debate on 2 measures to check the Trump Administration’s use of military force:  The No War Against Iran Act &amp; a measure that would repeal the 2002 Iraq AUMF.  The Constitution gives Congress not the president the power to declare war! https://t.co/EApDVVZX4v,2020-01-30 19:30:02,Twitter Web App,21,51
It is sickening to celebrate the anniversary of this stain on our country. Dumping asylum seekers in dangerous Mexican border towns is beneath who we are as a country.    Doubling down &amp; adding #Brazil is an act of cruelty to the Brazilian people. #RestoreAsylumNow https://t.co/qVL1gc4aYi,2020-01-30 19:19:29,Twitter Web App,7,28
Things that are in the #PublicInterest:   Protecting the democratic process from foreign interference. Providing health care to every American. Curtailing gun violence. Reversing climate change.   Things that are NOT in the public interest:   Helping Donald Trump get re-elected. https://t.co/0cLY71Gl2z,2020-01-30 16:12:10,Twitter Web App,57,120
We must continue to honor the memory of the Jesuit priests and others murdered in El Salvador in 1989. Sanctioning those responsible is an important step.  Thank you @RepMcGovern for your leadership in pursuing justice. https://t.co/ailko5p5bS,2020-01-30 15:30:12,Twitter Web App,12,34

Yesterday @EnergyCommerce's Health Subcommittee held a hearing on my bipartisan Safeguarding Therapeutics Act. Counterfeit medical devices pose a significant health and national security threat and this bill will aid federal officials in destroying these dangerous items.,2020-01-30 14:53:15,Twitter Web App,3,3
If there’s any doubt about what I said just tell your Senate GOP friends to let John Bolton testify. https://t.co/o04npQZcY6,2020-01-30 03:37:25,Twitter for iPhone,48,126
The American people support witnesses in the impeachment trial 75%-20%.   Refusing them will be remembered as an historic cover-up. #DefendOurDemocracy https://t.co/Cz85SdTMSm,2020-01-29 17:10:34,Twitter Web App,132,279
I am deeply disturbed by the Supreme Court siding with @POTUS’ public-charge ruling. We are a nation of immigrants and to disqualify those seeking freedom for economic reasons is disgusting. https://t.co/jgr0e1qiXS,2020-01-28 15:57:51,Twitter for iPhone,18,45
John Bolton was there.   He knows what the President did and saw it firsthand.   We can’t wait for a book release.   Will four GOP Senators have the courage to vote to hear from witnesses and help end this cover-up?,2020-01-27 22:49:09,Twitter for iPhone,108,326
3 years ago the Trump Administration issued a discriminatory #MuslimBan. This ban has not made us safer it’s morally reprehensible and un-American. https://t.co/1wm0LafG7d,2020-01-27 15:57:28,Twitter Web App,40,85
So sad. Just a shocking tragedy all around. Our hearts go out to all of the families of those lost in this terrible accident. https://t.co/vFBlvxAXfD,2020-01-27 03:00:53,Twitter for iPhone,4,31
I just came back from a similar trip overseas. New York continues to lead the way in fighting Anti-Semitism hatred and bigotry. #NeverForget https://t.co/k7vt69taf8,2020-01-26 17:10:41,Twitter for iPhone,5,26
Dear @SenateGOP  This is how history remembers Republicans who had the courage to do what was right during the Nixon impeachment.   And BTW the article ends with:  "He was reelected to Congress after his impeachment vote time after time after time." https://t.co/r1eJ59HRUB,2020-01-26 17:03:51,Twitter Web App,87,158
I was pleased to join @HouseDemocrats this past December in passing legislation which will end this crisis by empowering the federal government to negotiate drug costs. https://t.co/7DscbLW5JL,2020-01-24 21:20:11,Twitter Web App,5,8
REMINDER: President Trump’s hollow promise to address drug prices means once again American families will face rising drug costs in 2020. https://t.co/4vkP0X7Hlo,2020-01-24 21:20:11,Twitter Web App,11,12
Kids in cages.   Families torn apart.   Eliminating people’s health care.  No attempt to curtail gun violence.  Weakening environmental protections that keep us healthy and safe.   The list goes on and on...   Tell me again about the “sanctity of life”? https://t.co/PAwvccRiZf,2020-01-24 18:00:43,Twitter Web App,254,524
Today @RepDianaDeGette and I led over 50 of House colleagues on a letter to @SecAzar demanding that he replace his watered down youth tobacco policy with a complete ban on flavored e-cigs. We must protect our children instead of caving to Big Tobacco. https://t.co/sRW5lQeQb6,2020-01-23 16:07:59,Twitter Web App,9,23
In my latest opinion piece for @lohud I discuss how the #CitizensUnited decision has had a corrosive effect on our democratic process and what we need to do to fix it. @StopBigMoney #EndCitizensUnited https://t.co/r4pU6CySt7,2020-01-22 03:46:36,Twitter Web App,18,37
Today marks 10 years since the awful #CitizensUnited decision by #SCOTUS.   Let’s be clear: money is not speech.  Our democracy shouldn’t belong to the person—or corporation—with the deepest pockets.  I'm proud of my "A" rating from @StopBigMoney: https://t.co/G8ipaBiwRY,2020-01-21 16:48:27,Twitter Web App,19,42
To all the young people participating today in the #MLKDay #DayofService--including the wonderful group here from @JTeen in #Westchester--thank you so much for your commitment to keeping the #MartinLutherKingJr #Dream alive. #IHaveADream https://t.co/mVKxIYjCwc,2020-01-20 21:13:20,Twitter Web App,5,15
It was my honor to address the congregation at Trinity Baptist Church in the #Bronx this morning at the annual #MLKDay celebration cohosted by @rubendiazjr.   Today let’s remember the values #DrKing stood for &amp; rededicate ourselves to the fight for justice and equality for all. https://t.co/DT8ZOBfujK,2020-01-20 17:10:34,Twitter for iPhone,9,16
I was very happy to join my friends at Bethesda Baptist Church &amp; @NAACP #NewRochelle last night for their annual Jubilee Celebration which this year honored my dear friend @DCEKenJenkins.
