On this day in 1854 the Republican Party was born at this schoolhouse in Ripon Wisconsin! Today I'm proud to represent Ripon and Wisconsin's 6th district and continue the fight to protect individual rights that started on that 166 years ago. https://t.co/RmEUp6IQxm,2020-03-20 23:00:06,joe.sentry,10,38

St. Patrick's Day is a major holiday for those across our country and Wisconsin with Irish family roots. I wish all those who celebrate today a safe and joyous time with their families at home! https://t.co/JaTvcW9vku,2020-03-17 18:30:06,joe.sentry,2,2
Joe Biden thinks he can hide his radical stance on gun control from us but we know better than that. While vice president Biden was President Obama's right-hand man in raising taxes pushing through Obamacare and restricting our right to bear arms. https://t.co/DUNPpCXMea,2020-03-11 20:15:05,joe.sentry,2,2
The Democrats will do anything they can to distract us from how much of a disaster their impeachment scheme was. The American people have seen through their facade and now trust in the America-First agenda led by me and my Republican colleagues. https://t.co/pGpY5Tdcc7,2020-03-10 22:30:04,joe.sentry,1,0
.@POTUS's agenda is helping secure our border stopping human smugglers and drug cartels from entering our country and providing law enforcement with the tools necessary to enforce the rule of law. https://t.co/hXFGvmPsIT,2020-03-06 23:10:04,joe.sentry,2,1
Don't be fooled - the Democrats' do not have the American worker's best interests at heart. Their plans to take over our healthcare will only benefit the coastal elites not the hard-working people of Wisconsin. https://t.co/sRC173AKAB,2020-03-03 14:55:04,joe.sentry,2,1
We know socialism will fail in America because we've tried it before in the Midwest! The town of New Harmony Indiana tried their own socialist experiment and it left their community in poverty for years to come. https://t.co/OpyCzDupPt,2020-02-26 22:30:05,joe.sentry,1,0
While Democrats for president praise socialism we don't have to go back to the 1980s to know it's destined to fail in America. Venezuela is a clear example in today's time of how socialism always leads to poverty and tyranny no matter who's in charge. https://t.co/bScZA1sNsz,2020-02-26 18:45:05,joe.sentry,1,0
Bernie Sanders said "truth is truth" when praising communist dictator Fidel Castro. Let's be clear what the real truth is Castro was responsible for the death &amp; starvation of thousands. No person who praises communism is worthy of being president. https://t.co/eyxdf3SP6Y,2020-02-26 00:25:05,joe.sentry,1,1
We have a responsibility to look out for consumers &amp; protect them from the practice of predatory loans. If it's considered wrong for our military members to pay rates as high as 300% it should be for other borrowers too. https://t.co/oL8A5ulgQ3,2020-02-21 16:45:04,joe.sentry,1,0
For far too long residents of Wisconsin have been subjected to loans with interest rates at times as high as 300%. It's time for Congress to protect consumers and join my bipartisan fight to end predatory loans! https://t.co/9NJUroNwkf,2020-02-20 15:55:02,joe.sentry,1,2
Today let's celebrate the life of our nation's foremost founding father George Washington. Without his honor and selfless service we wouldn't have the freedoms we enjoy in our republic. Happy #PresidentsDay! https://t.co/BGB50CnZnA,2020-02-17 23:15:07,joe.sentry,2,4
I had a fantastic time meeting so many of you at the Cedarburg Winter Festival parade today. I'm thankful for our volunteers coming out despite the cold and I can't wait for next year's parade! https://t.co/4cCmyYKi4X,2020-02-16 00:30:17,joe.sentry,1,3
Bernie Sanders' win last night in New Hampshire is the latest sign the Democratic Party is embracing socialism. If he wins this November we will witness a government takeover of healthcare higher taxes and trillions of dollars of debt. https://t.co/Bwi1CODCbO,2020-02-13 16:45:03,joe.sentry,0,0
A majority of Wisconsin voters agree it's time to end the practice of predatory loans. No person should ever be forced to pay interest rates as high as 300% on a loan and I'm proud to be part of the bipartisan fight to protect our hard-working taxpayers. https://t.co/WL4fMmzA8u,2020-02-11 21:55:03,joe.sentry,2,2
By adding 225000 jobs the economy is off to a fantastic start to 2020! President Trump's policies continue to benefit Wisconsin and I'm proud to support his free-market agenda. https://t.co/wtZL6XU3OY,2020-02-07 19:30:03,joe.sentry,2,0
Ronald Reagan fought for an America that provided freedom for its citizens at home and stood against tyranny abroad. Thanks to his legacy our nation remains the greatest nation in the history of the world. Happy Birthday President Reagan! https://t.co/0u8kdD3HKV,2020-02-06 19:50:07,joe.sentry,0,3
The United States Senate did the right thing today by acquitting @POTUS. This impeachment sham had gone on long enough and it's time for Congress to finally get back to work. https://t.co/v9R1syBfCF,2020-02-06 00:10:02,joe.sentry,1,0
This is GREAT news! By signing the USMCA trade deal into law @POTUS has secured a major victory for Wisconsin's workers farmers and businesses. While I would have preferred to see this deal signed much sooner this is a big step forward for our country. https://t.co/44cSka1LVi,2020-01-30 00:00:04,joe.sentry,1,0
Over two years ago my Republican colleagues and I helped @POTUS pass tax reform for the American people. But we shouldn't end there - we must make these tax cuts permanent and create even more relief for families across Wisconsin and our country. https://t.co/E5eJZVeinv,2020-01-28 20:05:04,joe.sentry,1,1
On this day we remember the 6 million Jewish lives that were lost during the horrors of the Holocaust. Today also marks the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz in 1945. Let us never forget the evil that is antisemitism. https://t.co/IYepm5wuFy,2020-01-28 00:15:05,joe.sentry,1,2
Today marks the 47th anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision. Since then 61.6 million innocent unborn lives have been lost and remains one of the great tragedies of our nation. As your representative to Congress I will always stand for the right to life. https://t.co/7WPivy3ZtD,2020-01-23 01:05:05,joe.sentry,3,4
House Democrats could have used their majority in Congress to  secure the border solve the student loan crisis and create tax relief for all Americans. Instead they have spent the last year scheming on ways to remove @POTUS from office. https://t.co/ytZtD5BeO7,2020-01-22 15:00:06,joe.sentry,1,3
