At the conclusion of this morning’s meeting we demanded a full House briefing led by the Intelligence Chiefs with direct knowledge and oversight of this issue. Congress requires full knowledge of the facts. (10/11),2020-06-30 19:04:37,Twitter Web App,6,12
As his own intelligence chiefs have promised further investigation of this issue the President has failed to even admonish Putin but rather reward him. (9/11),2020-06-30 19:04:36,Twitter Web App,5,13
