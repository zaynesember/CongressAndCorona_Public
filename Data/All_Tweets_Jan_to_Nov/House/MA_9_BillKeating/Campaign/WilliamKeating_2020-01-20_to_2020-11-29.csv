We are facing tough days ahead but President-electJoe Biden and VP-elect Kamala Harris know that there is no challenge or obstacle that America can't overcome by working together. Let the healing begin.,2020-11-07 17:10:23,Twitter for iPhone,3,11
Vice President-elect Harris will make history as our first female Vice President our first Black Vice President and our first South Asian American Vice President.,2020-11-07 17:10:22,Twitter for iPhone,2,10
There will be no sigh of relief until noon on 1/20/21 but knowing that we will have an American President who is compassionate and will fight for all of us - regardless of who you voted for - should give us all the strength to move forward with our heads held high.,2020-11-07 17:10:22,Twitter for iPhone,1,3

Donald Trump is savaging democracy and he is savaging the rule of law. He wants to stop counting the votes - but if we stopped right now he would lose. What he actually wants is for states to stop counting votes for his opponent. #mapoli,2020-11-06 00:42:54,Twitter for iPhone,8,48
Finally yesterday's election did not end the pandemic nor the current session of Congress - the Senate must take immediate action in the lame-duck session to put relief into the hands of Americans suffering from the impacts of this pandemic.,2020-11-04 17:16:39,Twitter for iPhone,0,10
I am not celebrating yet as the course of the 117th Congress and our country's future is so closely tied to the final results of the Presidential Election. Every single vote must be counted because voters decide who wins an election not candidates.,2020-11-04 17:16:39,Twitter for iPhone,0,12
