2/2 I know this because I did the work to contact the City &amp; the railroads to find out what’s being done to address this. A city inspector determined the bridge is safe. There is more to be done and I’m happy to work on it. Unlike my opponent I actually get things done. #IL03 https://t.co/xOb7xkuBVt,2020-01-24 17:47:35,Twitter for iPhone,2,11
ANOTHER NEWMAN FACT-CHECK: Once again my opponent is making FALSE CLAIMS. 1: this bridge is OUTSIDE the 3rd District. 2: Newman’s lack of knowledge about infrastructure is concerning. The zipties she references were holding a sign to the bridge not holding up the bridge 1/2,2020-01-24 17:47:32,Twitter for iPhone,2,17

One of the best parts of my job is meeting #veterans like Bill Molony who fought bravely for our country. Bill was exposed to Agent Orange in Vietnam but had trouble getting his VA benefits. It was my privilege to help Bill get the medical care he rightly deserves. #IL03 https://t.co/4pC0uQITJG,2020-01-23 21:01:20,Buffer,4,20

Marie Newman's healthcare scheme would double our federal taxes abolish employer-provided insurance and jeopardize access to the doctors of our choice. Sorry we cannot afford Marie Newman! #ThePriceIsWrong #IL03 https://t.co/8wDydMbfKV,2020-01-22 22:27:53,Twitter Web App,4,16
Thank you to @chitribopinions for the opportunity to debate my opponents about the issues that matter most to residents in #ILO3. I was proud to be able to speak to the great progress we have made in the district but understand there is plenty more work to do! #twil https://t.co/j1kf08QWZ2,2020-01-21 23:21:47,Twitter for iPhone,3,5
Thank you to Greg and Kathy Tonner for hosting a wonderful meet and greet at their beautiful home in #Beverly last night.

Our seniors deserve the best healthcare we can provide. Marie Newman's healthcare scheme would eliminate Medicare and double all federal taxes. Sorry we cannot afford Marie Newman. #ThePriceIsWrong #IL03 https://t.co/VxXlrPPORq,2020-01-21 01:30:53,Twitter for iPhone,6,22

Marie Newman will not hesitate to mislead voters to win this election. Half truths and outright lies are what have created this hostile political climate we have today. We need honesty and integrity to continue representing our great district! #il03   https://t.co/Ht6WFyfaqo https://t.co/jCOWZ0ySfw,2020-01-20 00:54:07,Twitter Web App,12,16
