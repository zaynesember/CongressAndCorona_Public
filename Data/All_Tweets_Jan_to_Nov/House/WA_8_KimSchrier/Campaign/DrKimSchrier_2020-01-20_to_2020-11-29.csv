President Trump falsely claimed he's protecting patients with pre-existing conditions -- his administration is actually fighting in court to strike down the #ACA.   I’ll always fight to protect coverage for people in #WA08 and across the country.    https://t.co/pQVzp9j1nM,2020-02-06 22:08:03,Gain Platform,50,101
I’m proud to have the endorsement of @giffordscourage the gun safety organization founded by Gabrielle Giffords.   As a doctor scientist mother and congresswoman I promise to continue working to protect our families from gun violence. https://t.co/pxiihhbi7m,2020-01-30 00:32:50,Gain Platform,37,174
It was such a privilege to spend some time with the @washingtonea this morning. Making sure our children receive a world class education is one of my top priorities and I’m grateful to our teachers for their tireless work. #WA08 https://t.co/FlueHjJeNa,2020-01-25 19:28:55,Twitter for iPhone,3,27

As a doctor I know it's past time for the pharmaceutical executives responsible for the opioid crisis to be held accountable for the damage the crisis is causing in our country. This is a step in the right direction. #WA08 https://t.co/MhxY257mDw,2020-01-23 22:43:47,Twitter Web App,9,54
47 years ago today #RoevWade became the law of the land.   But Republicans are still attacking this vital right.   As the only woman doctor in Congress I know how important reproductive health care is and I’ll fight to protect it from these attacks.,2020-01-22 20:00:34,Gain Platform,17,68
10 years ago today the Supreme Court unjustly ruled that corporations are people and opened the floodgates for undisclosed unlimited campaign spending.

Today we celebrate the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and his commitment to justice and equality.   But while we take today to honor him we must also vow to continue working towards fulfilling his dream of equal rights for all. #MLKday https://t.co/Tm5xMhF4nm,2020-01-20 18:10:57,Gain Platform,5,32
