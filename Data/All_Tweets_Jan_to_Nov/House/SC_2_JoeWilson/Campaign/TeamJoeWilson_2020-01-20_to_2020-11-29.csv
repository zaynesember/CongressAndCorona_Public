Last week Nancy Pelosi pushed through a scheme to completely restructure our republic. Next week she’ll allow a few to vote for many - defying the oath Members of Congress take and Constitution.   Congress needs to get back to WORK! https://t.co/NXzvcDINDI,2020-05-22 18:33:17,Twitter for iPhone,2,3
House Dems refuse lead. But it’s never been about leading it’s about power.   Americans and American business need help instead House Dems pushes a bill that mentions cannabis more than jobs... https://t.co/hCDV8PwnLH,2020-05-22 12:19:27,Twitter for iPhone,3,1
Keeping the House out of session despite proposed methods to safely work + Continuing to search for nonexistent impeachable offenses = House Democrats would rather pursue their own political agendas than fulfill their duty to serve the American people https://t.co/jmHHc3Jdo7,2020-05-20 13:44:43,Twitter for iPhone,6,3
The impeachment hoax continues. House Democrats aren’t serious about helping Americans out of this crisis only themselves.  https://t.co/7UNd5Tw2tC,2020-05-19 21:21:49,Twitter for iPhone,3,1
One of these things is not like the other can you guess which one?   @realDonaldTrump ✅ working  US House ❌ NOT working  US Senate ✅ working  US Supreme Court ✅ working   Nancy Pelosi and House Dems just don’t seem to want to work.,2020-05-18 23:55:52,Twitter for iPhone,4,4
The Speaker is consolidating power by allowing a few vote for many with her proxy scheme. It’s never been about safety it’s all about power.   If Members don’t want to work and represent the citizens they represent they should just resign.,2020-05-16 15:11:19,Twitter for iPhone,16,25
When Members of Congress can sit home skip out on their oath of office and still collect a pay check it doesn’t exactly inspire Americans to get back to work.,2020-05-16 00:37:53,Twitter for iPhone,1,4
Over 200 Members of Congress just voted to reaffirm their support to giving your tax dollars to non-Americans in the form of direct stimulus payments.   This bill is a political stunt by the Speaker.,2020-05-16 00:31:41,Twitter for iPhone,2,3
False.  House Democrats approved a scheme to allow the Speaker to vote in place of members staying at home while still getting paid. https://t.co/DBM3B9KvMR,2020-05-15 23:36:19,Twitter for iPhone,4,3
The House is voting right now to kill a provision in Nancy Pelosi’s wishlist bill that allows direct stimulus payments to illegal immigrants.   Seriously?! The Speaker’s prorities are not the priorities of Americans. House Dems are unfit to lead.,2020-05-15 23:30:51,Twitter for iPhone,3,2

Americans are tired of the games Nancy Pelosi and Democrats are playing.   This bill was never about serving the needs of Americans it’s ALWAYS been about paying back political promises.,2020-05-15 21:33:20,Twitter for iPhone,3,3
Our priorities are crystal clear. @GOPLeader and @SteveScalise are the leaders Americans deserve in the House. I am proud to serve along side them. https://t.co/hQXSFrrITf,2020-05-15 00:45:34,Twitter for iPhone,3,2
Joe's opponent will try to appeal to far left donors to build a war chest. Saying Joe is out of touch and heartless to vote against this bill all the while raising several thousands from it. Donate to help fight back: https://t.co/IwA8PO4LAr,2020-05-14 18:53:38,Twitter for iPhone,1,1

Trimming a Christmas tree bill in secret voting in the middle of the night on emergency spending while the other chamber isn’t even town and preventing hearings on China = Democrat “leadership” in Congress. https://t.co/GfvFzsyyfv,2020-05-13 17:28:58,Twitter for iPhone,3,2
