The #TrumpBudget cuts $170 BILLION from student loan programs over the decade. Instead of creating new opportunities for young Americans President Trump’s budget puts college further out of reach. https://t.co/keNHpCckIH,2020-02-11 20:19:49,Twitter Web App,3,2

I'm happy to have helped secure $93 million for the continuing effort to widen and deepen the harbor at #JAXPort.

#OTD in 1960 students from @FAMU_1887 participated in a sit-in at a Woolworth’s lunch counter in #Tallahassee to protest racial inequality.

Great to see #HairLove win for Best Animated Short. We must do our part to promote acceptance of all hair textures &amp; styles. That's why I'm a sponsor of the #CROWNAct.

During #GunViolenceSurvivorsWeek I’m honoring Josh Quick a survivor from #FL05. The @FloridaState law student suffered trauma following a mass shooting in 2018 in #TLH.

In the @FSCDems hearing I asked the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau why staff diversity – women &amp; minorities – has not increased at the Bureau. Director Kraninger says it has.  But by how much? Only 1% since 2017 for minorities &amp; as for women the percentage hasn’t moved😒 https://t.co/Qzxbheaw3v,2020-02-06 19:11:17,Twitter Web App,5,10
In today's Financial Services hearing we are examining the Trump Administration’s efforts to eliminate public housing. We have a housing crisis in our nation. When public housing units are demolished and not replaced what is the overall impact on the community? https://t.co/XoyIwgEEUj,2020-02-05 20:52:50,Twitter Web App,4,6
Most immigrants in our country are honest hard working and here because they want to build better lives for themselves and their families. But the president only wants to highlight bad actors to excite his base #HatersGonnaHate #SOTU https://t.co/5eyAX6YPrm,2020-02-05 05:09:53,Twitter Web App,4,11
The president mentioned how the “strong economy is lifting everyone up.” But who is really benefiting? It is not a “#BlueCollarBoom” but a white collar boom. We bailed out Wall Street but we still haven’t bailed out Main Street. All Americans deserve a livable wage. #SOTU https://t.co/AHgAz07oje,2020-02-05 04:48:23,Twitter Web App,7,15
@realDonaldTrump claims he supports efforts to lower health care costs but since he has taken   office he has worked everyday to dismantle the Afffordable Care Act. #SOTU,2020-02-05 02:50:12,Twitter Web App,0,6
I hope the president discusses our crumbling infrastructure the housing crisis affordable health care and a path to a more united nation. We are at a tumultuous time in our democracy and it is vital that we bring our country together for a stronger more stable America. #SOTU,2020-02-05 02:11:50,Twitter Web App,1,8

There are many barriers in accessing employment opportunities. One of those factors includes an individual’s credit history.
