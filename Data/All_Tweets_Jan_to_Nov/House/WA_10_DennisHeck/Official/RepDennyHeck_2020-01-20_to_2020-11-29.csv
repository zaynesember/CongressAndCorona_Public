The American people respect their military. They admire them. No other institution in America commands such high levels of support.   The quickest way for that sentiment to turn is for the President to use the military to beat down dissent and protest. https://t.co/NBh4AtBU4N,2020-06-04 18:47:58,Twitter Web App,15,48
As I said in May “There is no need to risk the life of even one cadet for what is nothing more than an exercise in vanity for President Trump.” We’ve seen in recent days that President Trump will go to great lengths – tear-gassing protesters endangering cadets – for a photo op. https://t.co/IFv9ninlFw,2020-06-04 17:40:01,Twitter for iPhone,5,29
On May 1 I wrote to Defense Secretary Esper urging him not to bring graduating cadets back to West Point amid the pandemic just so President Trump could give an in-person address.

I've been calling on the Administration to pull the trigger on the Defense Production Act for weeks.

The US Postal Service has warned Congress that it will run out of funds in a matter of months. That's why I'm cosponsoring the Protect Our Post Offices Act and I'll keep advocating that emergency funding for the Postal Service be included in the next coronavirus relief package. https://t.co/HljaqyAy6U,2020-04-21 01:12:20,Twitter Media Studio,53,197

Constituent question: “Because of COVID-19 I've been laid off and will soon lose my health insurance. I will be getting unemployment pay but half of that will go to pay for health insurance.

The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) has run out of funds. That’s why I’m cosponsoring legislation introduced by @RepDerekKilmer to authorize more funding to help small businesses.

Nearly 17 million Americans have filed for unemployment in the last three weeks. Congress has passed significantly expanded unemployment assistance.

President Trump fired Col. Vindman and his brother. He fired Gordon Sondland. He fired DNI Maguire. He punishes those who have the courage to stand up to him.

Throughout our nation's history ordinary Americans have risen to meet extraordinary challenges. On National Medal of Honor Day we pay homage to the bravest heroes who risked -- and in many cases gave -- their lives for their fellow soldiers.,2020-03-26 02:04:27,Twitter Web App,2,42
I led a letter today with @RepJayapal and other members of the WA delegation urging @fema and @HHSGov to allow #COVID19 test specimens in WA to be sent to our public health labs that have capacity. This would cut the wait time for results from up to 8 days to only 24-48 hours. https://t.co/PdREZBCrgN,2020-03-25 23:45:14,Twitter Web App,76,258
The entire WA federal delegation -- House and Senate -- have mobilized in an effort to secure much needed FEMA assistance for Washington state.

We need to get cash in the hands of displaced workers quickly and directly.

Thank you @SpeakerPelosi and @RepMaxineWaters for putting #FamiliesFirst w/ $100bn in emergency rental assistance in the House stimulus bill a provision I introduced earlier today.

Due to the #COVID19 crisis many American families won't be able to afford April rent next week. Today I introduced emergency legislation to put $100 billion into rental assistance and expand the number of people who will get help. https://t.co/9IonOWYXOu,2020-03-23 19:55:27,Twitter Web App,30,111
Congress must also be bold and even more focused on the needs of working Americans who face unprecedented economic disruption. The federal government can and must step in to offset the precipitous decline in economic output and maintain aid until families are back on their feet.,2020-03-23 18:40:10,Twitter Web App,1,12
The Fed clearly understands the magnitude of the crisis and I applaud them taking bold action today. These efforts represent a clear attempt to better support regular Americans than in 2008. https://t.co/i7uwtApLie,2020-03-23 18:39:36,Twitter Web App,1,11

I stand ready to work with @GovInslee to ensure that Washington families can access cash through unemployment insurance.

Congress should take the next step of ensuring that any individual who has a federal student loan and loses their job should be able to suspend their payments through 6 months beyond the end of the public health emergency and we know the economy has recovered.,2020-03-21 16:04:51,Twitter Web App,5,16
4⃣ Student loan assistance  ✅The President has announced that federal student loan borrowers can suspend payments for 60 days – this is an excellent first step. But many Americans may not have fully recovered from the economic fallout within that timeframe.,2020-03-21 16:04:40,Twitter Web App,2,4
Now Congress must step up and ensure that renters receive increased and immediate assistance. We can start by expanding housing voucher eligibility and benefits.,2020-03-21 16:04:06,Twitter Web App,2,14

3⃣ Pillow blanket and roof  Housing is the largest monthly expense for American families exceeding healthcare food transportation and education combined. To ensure families can emerge from this crisis we must provide relief from housing costs.,2020-03-21 16:00:03,Twitter Web App,3,11
2⃣ Keep American families healthy  We must expand benefits for programs like Medicaid and food stamps and help as many people access them as possible by suspending time limits for eligibility and providing incentives to states to sign up larger %s of their eligible population.,2020-03-21 15:59:20,Twitter Web App,2,13
Congress must also ensure that all economically distressed Americans can access aid particularly contractors and the self-employed. We can do this through Disaster Unemployment Assistance by invoking a Major Disaster Declaration. https://t.co/hBtnWTIiwi,2020-03-21 15:58:12,Twitter Web App,1,8
1⃣ Unemployment insurance.  We're already too late to keep millions on payrolls but unemployment assistance is the next best way to provide cash directly. We must expand the minimum payment extend it to 6 months past the end of the crisis when the economy is back on its feet.,2020-03-21 15:55:26,Twitter Web App,0,16
We don’t have months—or even weeks—to get help to those who need it. There are millions of Americans who need assistance NOW.  We don’t need to reinvent the wheel.

As the percentage of workers in unions has dropped in the last 40 years more wealth has gone to those at the top while the median income for Americans has barely budged after adjusting for inflation.  The median.  That means that half of our population is worse off than that. https://t.co/psSe335sSz,2020-02-07 03:06:00,Twitter Web App,17,51

The President did it. The facts are not in dispute and Republican senators have said as much. President Trump tried to cheat in the 2020 election and he will do it again. The only question that remains is: what will WE do? https://t.co/cychQPRDMD,2020-02-05 20:29:48,Twitter Media Studio,62,314
Puget Sound is the heart of western Washington. But it is in grave danger. Fortunately tribal state and local entities have been hard at work to restore this national treasure.

I look forward to working with Sen. Crapo to enact the SAFE Banking Act. Cannabis is now legal to varying degrees in 47 states.

John Bolton has said he will testify if subpoenaed by the Senate.
