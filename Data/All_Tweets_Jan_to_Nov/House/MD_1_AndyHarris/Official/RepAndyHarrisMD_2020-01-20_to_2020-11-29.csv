I still have serious concerns with the Senate bailout bill being considered-and now its possible that if the bill comes to the House there may not even be debate on a $2 trillion package!  Not the way to do the nation’s business. Why not break up such a large bill? #skipthepork,2020-03-23 00:40:58,Twitter for iPhone,52,127
I hope @RussVought45 is quickly confirmed by the Senate to serve as Director of the Office of Management and Budget. Under his leadership we are draining the swamp and saving billions in burdensome regulatory costs.,2020-03-19 02:05:28,Twitter Web App,54,171
I'm pleased that the Administration will extend the deadline for tax payments for people's 2019 tax return to July 15th. However please note that the filing deadline will remain April 15th.  https://t.co/ZGmbHmXp5g,2020-03-19 01:51:44,Twitter Web App,23,42

This is a critical moment for the US. While the Coronavirus bill tonight is not perfect I plan to vote for it. Now is the time to stand with @realDonaldTrump and work together without partisanship to limit the coronavirus and its harmful effects on our economy and way of life.,2020-03-14 01:45:05,Twitter for iPhone,10,56

@LowerShoreProg @LowerShoreProg False attacks on my family contribute nothing. Socialism is bad for America. I understand that the Lower Shore Progressive Caucus supports socialist policies - I disagree with them but that is not a basis for false ad hominem attacks.,2020-03-10 02:13:21,Twitter Web App,0,0
My parents fled communist Eastern Europe. Their experience and the suffering and repression of millions like them are why I never want to see America become a socialist country.
