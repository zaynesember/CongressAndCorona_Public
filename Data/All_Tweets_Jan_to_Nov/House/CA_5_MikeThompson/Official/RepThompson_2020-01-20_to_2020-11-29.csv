Joined a roundtable with the @WaysMeansCmte to hear from unemployed workers who lost their jobs through no fault of their own because of #COVID19.

The #HeroesAct had $1 trillion for state and local governments and Leader McConnell should hold a vote on that bill right away to help places like Sonoma County.,2020-07-29 15:14:04,Twitter Web App,1,15
Sonoma County like so many local and city governments across our nation is facing huge cuts because of the Coronavirus pandemic and they need our help. https://t.co/wtxBkbAcGU,2020-07-29 15:14:04,Twitter Web App,3,11

Another reason that the Senate Republican Coronavirus relief package is a nonstarter – it includes the TRUST Act a bill that would allow cuts to Medicare and Social Security to be fast tracked through Congress. https://t.co/fuueIKamoC,2020-07-28 15:30:29,Twitter Web App,17,24
Democrats are ready to negotiate; we have been ready for two months since we passed the #HeroesAct. I hope Republicans will compromise and do it fast so we can get another package passed and signed into law. We need to do this for the American people.,2020-07-27 23:49:05,Twitter for iPhone,1,8
The bill fails to provide funding for state and local governments does not do enough for people out of work and the struggling small businesses and doesn’t include some of my priorities like tax provisions to help small businesses.,2020-07-27 23:49:04,Twitter for iPhone,2,7

McConnell said this week he wants to restrict access to any new stimulus payments to households earning under $40000 a year.
