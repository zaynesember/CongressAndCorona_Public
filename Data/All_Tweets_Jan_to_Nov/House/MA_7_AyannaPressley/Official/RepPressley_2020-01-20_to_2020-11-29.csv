Our bill provides funding to state &amp; local gov’ts to  ✅ Train frontline staff on disease prevention &amp; mitigation  ✅ Provide hazard pay for frontline workers working to support those experiencing homelessness ✅ Reimburse local providers for costs incurred associated w/ COVID19,2020-03-23 18:39:57,Twitter Web App,92,432
Today @RepRashida &amp; I are introducing the Public Health Emergency Shelter Act legislation to support people experiencing homelessness and the frontline workers who care for them during the #COVID19 public health crisis. https://t.co/pc6aydYUoy,2020-03-23 18:39:57,Twitter Web App,210,767
We must prioritize student debt cancellation for the 45 million borrowers who are struggling to pay off debt during #COVIDー19. Our bill supports borrowers by cancelling $30K in outstanding student loan debt &amp; providing immediate monthly payment relief ⬇️ https://t.co/RwYrfpgAtp,2020-03-23 16:27:37,Twitter Web App,44,198
The $1.6 TRILLION #studentdebt crisis stands in the way of meaningful economic recovery after #COVIDー19 pandemic. This is why we intro'd the Student Debt Emergency Relief Act which will cancel at least $30K in student loan debt per borrower CC: @Ilhan https://t.co/MKbMK2SY4K,2020-03-23 15:49:23,Twitter Web App,266,909
There’s something called clemency Donald Trump. Why don’t you use it so our prisons don’t become incubators for #COVID19? Did you even read our letter? CC: @SenWarren ➡ https://t.co/H26EpkKlhV https://t.co/4v5ixzp05E,2020-03-23 00:53:51,Twitter Web App,103,415
Simply pausing #studentloan payments during this crisis is not enough. We MUST #CancelStudentDebt as part of any #COVID_19 emergency economic stimulus package. Today @Ilhan &amp; I led our colleagues in urging House leadership to do just that.  https://t.co/qRqjiwstSE,2020-03-20 21:58:21,Twitter Web App,329,1426
More than 40000 seniors see their Social Security benefits tax refunds and other critical government benefits garnished because they have fallen behind on a student loan. Loan cancellation will have an intergenerational impact. More ⬇️ https://t.co/Clk0ndImAL,2020-03-20 18:23:23,Twitter Web App,21,86
Nearly 45 million people are crushed by student loan debt—Black and Latinx ppl disproportionately struggle as do our teachers and seniors. If we #CancelStudentDebt payments we help our neighbors keep food on the table &amp; keep themselves &amp; their families safe during this crisis.,2020-03-20 18:23:22,Twitter Web App,13,112
We must do better. Pausing student loan payments will NOT provide the relief workers &amp; families need to weather this crisis &amp; will increase pain down the road. We need student debt cancellation monthly payment relief &amp; protection from all debt collection. https://t.co/NyKLkLwnF7,2020-03-20 18:23:22,Twitter Web App,54,266
In these unprecedented &amp; uncertain times we can find comfort that there are selfless heroes all around us keeping us safe.

We know that those experiencing #homelessness are particularly vulnerable during #Covid_19 - many have underlying health conditions &amp; lack access to healthcare. We’re working to boost rental assistance allocate increased funds &amp; obtain additional space like hotel rooms #MA7,2020-03-18 23:08:46,Twitter Web App,13,61
We have to ensure that we are providing relief to small businesses. That means emergency long term business loans no cost refinancing and continuing to expand the safety net for employees and small employers alike #Covid_19 #MA7,2020-03-18 23:03:48,Twitter Web App,19,71
People should not have to choose between feeding their families or paying for health care. There are 30000 uninsured residents across #MA7  who lack health care coverage and we must ensure that they have access to free coronavirus testing and treatment. #COVIDー19,2020-03-18 22:46:01,Twitter Web App,13,67

What we’re talking about isn't just an issue of #housing its an issue of #publichealth. Evicting families during #COVID_19 pandemic would exacerbate the crisis &amp; threaten vulnerable communities.

@RepChuyGarcia @RepJayapal @RepKarenBass @RepJudyChu @RepSylviaGarcia @RepEspaillat @RepRaulGrijalva @SEARAC Our immigration system and mass incarceration are inextricably linked ignoring the humanity of individuals and decimating community.

Housing justice is an intersectional issue of economic juctice racial justice &amp; public health.

This #TrumpBudget is an attack on working families plain and simple. In addition to slashing #SNAP funding it would cut BILLIONS of dollars from critical social safety net programs like #SocialSecurity #Medicaid and #TANF. The cruelty is the point.,2020-02-12 20:47:35,Twitter Web App,42,178
A budget is a values statement and the only value reflected in the Occupant’s budget is cruelty. SNAP is the first line of defense for millions of hungry children and families but this admin wants to cut SNAP funding by $182 BILLION. #TrumpBudget,2020-02-12 20:35:06,Twitter Web App,82,265

The Constitution is sexist by design. The year is 2020 &amp; women in this country STILL aren't considered equal to men in the eyes of the federal gov't.  Tomorrow's vote on HJ Res 79 is a vote to actualize the movements built on the backs of women. It's a vote for equality. #ERANow https://t.co/cVYzw3hiVn,2020-02-12 17:39:34,Twitter Media Studio,568,2642

Starving a child is violence.   Punishing a mother and her family is violence   Contempt for poverty is violence.

.@CBP’s violation of a federal court order flies in the face of the rule of law. What’s worse they refuse to offer any explanation for their bigoted &amp; unlawful behavior. Today @SenMarkey @SenWarren &amp; I are demanding answers bc no one is above the law. https://t.co/zcK7AQEwu1,2020-01-23 18:38:18,Twitter Web App,62,210

For 47 years #RoevWade has kept #abortion legal &amp; yet the Trump Administration &amp; anti-reproductive #justice state legislatures have enacted 25 BANS on abortion in 2019 alone keeping abortion out of reach for millions of people struggling to make ends meet #MyRightMyDecision,2020-01-22 15:30:50,Twitter Web App,39,189
Today on the anniversary of #RoevWade we know #abortion access is hanging on by a thread. As Chair of the Abortion Access Task Force &amp; as a firm believer that abortion rights are human rights I will continue to fight inhumane abortion bans and affirm reproductive justice. https://t.co/fpabHf4U9w,2020-01-22 15:17:51,Twitter Web App,48,238
As a @Northeastern &amp; @UMassBoston student Shahab is my constituent &amp; I’m demanding answers. @CBP hastily put Shahab on a flight out of @BostonLogan w/o due process violating a court order. We won’t stand for this in the #MA7. #StopDeportingStudents  https://t.co/Ef009VZ9cp,2020-01-21 18:55:47,Twitter Web App,260,727
