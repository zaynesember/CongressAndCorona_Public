Black women have been robbed of things for a long time that’s nothing new  Robbed of our men who were lynched  Robbed of our children who were stolen from us at the auction block  But we will not be robbed of our joy  Joy is a necessary act of resistance https://t.co/N2YuVPNsSK,2020-01-20 20:25:10,Twitter for iPhone,3990,26832
