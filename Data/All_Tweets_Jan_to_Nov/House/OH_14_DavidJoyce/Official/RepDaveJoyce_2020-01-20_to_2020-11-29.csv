That’s why I joined @SenStabenow @senrobportman @RepMarcyKaptur @RepHuizenga @RepDebDingell in urging Congressional leaders to support #GreatLakes fisheries in the next #COVID19 package.

While the CARES Act provided $300 million to aid #fisheries impacted by the #COVID19 pandemic the law has been interpreted in a way that doesn’t allow the #GreatLakes region to qualify for that assistance.,2020-09-03 16:13:41,Twitter for iPhone,1,8
Did you know that #LakeErie is the walleye capital of the WORLD and supports one the the biggest freshwater commercial #fisheries in the WORLD?  Each year more than $300 MILLION is spent in the #Ohio Lake Erie basin on fishing alone 🎣,2020-09-03 16:13:41,Twitter for iPhone,4,16

The CARES Act is a product of bipartisanship in Congress - something we need more of right now. The stakes are too high for the partisan bickering to continue.  It's past time for negotiations on the next #COVID__19 relief package to restart.,2020-09-02 13:58:11,Twitter Web App,0,5
