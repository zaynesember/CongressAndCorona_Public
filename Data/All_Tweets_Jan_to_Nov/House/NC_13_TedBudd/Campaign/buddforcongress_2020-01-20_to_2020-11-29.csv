#DefundThePolice is dangerous and reckless.  Police officers protect us each and every day.  There are bad officers who have no place on the streets but the vast majority of police uphold their oath to serve and protect.  https://t.co/QbBZBITE7v,2020-06-10 19:47:31,Twitter Web App,1,1
#DefundThePolice is a dangerous and reckless idea.   We need to invest more in police officers so they are well-trained to do their jobs.   Ask every candidate if they support this radical idea so we know who will keep our homes safe. https://t.co/kAeGolkqwR,2020-06-10 18:58:06,Twitter Web App,3,3

Businesses are struggling to find workers.  The CARES Act created a perverse incentive where unemployment insurance pays more than work for some people.
