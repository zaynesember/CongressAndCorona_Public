According to a recent Gallup poll 61% of Americans say they’re better off today than three years ago and 59% say they’re more financially secure now than a year ago.   Our economy is soaring and Americans are thriving!https://t.co/ISh8jwE9lq,2020-02-13 16:57:46,Twitter Web App,30,52
We must hold universities accountable and bring transparency to the benefits they receive from foreign governments and persons. I've introduced H.R. 3921 to do just that.   Failing to do so puts our students at risk of foreign influence by China Saudi Arabia Qatar and others. https://t.co/ng7sYLirFW,2020-02-13 14:01:05,Twitter Web App,57,167
State and local governments that pick and choose which federal laws to enforce endanger American lives and must be held accountable. I’m proud to introduce legislation with @RepKenBuck today to make our communities safer. https://t.co/hiDWmnRYG5,2020-02-12 21:52:34,Twitter Web App,18,52

@SenSchumer calls a proposal to view the Bolton transcript in a secure location “absurd” yet when Adam Schiff held depositions and transcripts in a SCIF away from the public and Members of Congress Democrats praised the process. Hypocrisy at its finest.,2020-01-29 17:19:03,Twitter for iPhone,1,3
Adam Schiff and House Democrats failed to make a case for impeachment; it’s not the Senate’s job now.  Having the Senate call additional witnesses is like asking the judge and jury in a murder trial to go and collect evidence on the accused.,2020-01-28 22:26:38,Twitter Web App,77,300
Mocking Americans is a new low for CNN. In 2014 when Russian tanks were invading Ukraine Democrats didn’t care to look at Ukraine on a map or read the news to understand the true threat the Ukrainian people faced.

This is the difference between partisanship and moving the Country forward.

Under previous regulation 99% of Pennsylvania was defined as a “Waters of the United States” – subjecting our state to significant federal control.

For years China's communist government has blocked Taiwan’s participation in international organizations.
