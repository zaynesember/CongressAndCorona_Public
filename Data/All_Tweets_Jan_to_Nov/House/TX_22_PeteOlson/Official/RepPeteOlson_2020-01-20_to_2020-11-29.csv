790 days ago the #Citgo6 were wrongfully imprisoned in Venezuela. We will #NeverGiveUp until they are reunited with their families in the USA! @Citgo6C @FreeCitgo6 @Vvadell @aliriorafael8 @AZuvanich @MariaElenaCard4 @carmen_molinos https://t.co/PffE1wzIrx,2020-01-20 16:10:23,Twitter for iPhone,8,12

30 years ago today thousands of Hindus were forced to flee the Kashmir Valley exiled from their homes and torn from their families. It was an honor to speak at the #KashmirExodusDay candlelight vigil in #TX22 tonight — we will keep their memory alive! https://t.co/gf6UNCR93a,2020-01-20 03:19:16,Twitter for iPhone,9,13
