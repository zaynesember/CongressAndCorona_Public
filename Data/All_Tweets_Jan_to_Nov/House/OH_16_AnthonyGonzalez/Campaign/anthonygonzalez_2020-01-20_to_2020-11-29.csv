I don’t normally comment on these sorts of things but here goes:  1. I think we should start to re-open the economy in a thoughtful way.   2. We should use sound data science to guide us.  3.

Good. The best way to support the market is to -   1. Solve the health crisis  2. Assist people hardest hit by the crisis  3. Help businesses weather the economic storm so they can get back on their feet.

You know I always remember my Abuela telling it this way too.   On one hand Castro was stealing private property impoverishing the island and killing many who stood in his way.  On the other hand they had this great literacy program... https://t.co/hshdlcltRi,2020-02-24 03:50:25,Twitter for iPhone,57,314

Bernie is NOT proposing Denmark. He’s proposing state-run utilities single-payer healthcare (Denmark has mulitple payers) a federal jobs guarantee housing guarantee socialized credit and all the absurdity of the Green New Deal. This is much closer to CUBA not DENMARK https://t.co/MFXgFld81k,2020-02-23 17:07:00,Twitter for iPhone,37,192
@PatMcAfeeShow I had him winning but not like that. Total devastation. Incredible performance from @Tyson_Fury,2020-02-23 06:06:19,Twitter for iPhone,0,92

Important thread. Before people jump into the typical partisan corners just read what he’s saying.  Wages are clearly rising but the cost to thrive economically in America has exploded! If we aren’t laser focused on this set of problems we are completely missing the boat. https://t.co/4mW39a3G5r,2020-02-20 16:43:50,Twitter for iPhone,15,26
I’ve heard people try to make this argument before. It’s disgusting. If there is one place that we should all be equal it’s in the voting booth. Let’s keep it that way. https://t.co/uha6O9LSew,2020-02-19 21:36:31,Twitter for iPhone,10,138
Still thinking through this piece but the end is spot on. @oren_cass  “All this requires an economic consensus that emphasizes the importance of family community and industry to the nation’s liberty and prosperity.”  The Return of Conservative Economics https://t.co/8vy23Q6vY4,2020-02-18 18:18:06,Twitter for iPhone,2,5
There is still plenty of work to be done to lower healthcare costs improve workforce development student debt etc. but to deny the strength of this economy is to deny reality. https://t.co/ISXXB97v35,2020-02-16 19:51:57,Twitter for iPhone,4,83

The “universal coverage” = “Medicare 4 All” sleight of hand is one of the most dishonest points Bernie makes. The best healthcare systems in the world look nothing like Medicare 4 All.  Ramesh outlines this well here. https://t.co/R7XSzvjIRL,2020-02-14 03:37:02,Twitter for iPhone,3,35

@LtningSams I’m so sorry for your loss. I know how much you’ve always loved and cared for your Sams. Beautiful dogs who were always so lucky to have such a loving home. Praying for you.,2020-02-12 11:41:59,Twitter for iPhone,0,2

Great game. Congrats to the Chiefs and Andy Reid. That’s a lifetime of hard work paying off right there.  Someday this will be us Browns fans. I swear it will be.,2020-02-03 03:13:41,Twitter for iPhone,10,124

@LtningSams Interesting game. Niners aren’t letting them get anything beyond 15/20 yards. Going to force Mahomes to stay patient. That last throw shows that might be the right plan.,2020-02-03 01:54:48,Twitter for iPhone,0,1

Blessed for my 2 years with Tony. Never met a leader before or since like him. The title of his book “Quiet Strength” perfectly describes his style. Set a high bar for excellence and treated everyone with love &amp; respect as we all tried to meet it. Simple but powerful example. https://t.co/eO1mz5xYLj,2020-02-02 13:33:01,Twitter for iPhone,6,55

People often ask how do we stop being so divided. Complex answer but I do think it starts with everyone individually choosing to respect those who have different politics as arriving at those beliefs sincerely and intelligently.   In other words the opposite of this. https://t.co/6qARjWDBAP,2020-01-28 12:43:06,Twitter for iPhone,93,326

@LtningSams I made this exact same point to a friend on the other side last week. It’s only undermining democracy if it’s our side asking questions. If it’s their side then it’s completely legitimate and actually strengthens democracy. How that works I have no idea. Go figure.,2020-01-24 15:06:02,Twitter for iPhone,0,5
