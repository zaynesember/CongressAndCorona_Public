🚨 Joe Biden just let the truth slip: He wants to end the oil industry.  I can tell you firsthand: That would destroy jobs and the economy in Louisiana—and across America too.  The media should ask every House Democrat if they support this radical plan. https://t.co/sYHDRu9J2v,2020-10-23 03:40:49,Twitter for iPhone,161,428
Joe Biden has been in Washington for 47 years. And he's gotten nothing done.  He's all talk no action.  Just your typical swamp politician. https://t.co/Hw1mIoKl0f,2020-10-23 03:21:10,Twitter Media Studio,91,337
This tells you everything you need to know:  Tonight when Joe Biden was asked simple questions about his family's corrupt business dealings he dodged them and tried (but failed) to attack @realDonaldTrump instead.  He can’t refute it because it’s true.,2020-10-23 03:00:43,Twitter Web App,157,641
🚨 Joe Biden just said he supports expanding Paycheck Protection Program funding to help save America's small businesses.  He should call Speaker Pelosi.  She’s been BLOCKING it in the House for weeks. https://t.co/QLeLXPHXUS,2020-10-23 02:31:51,Twitter Media Studio,57,177
The Democrat governors Joe Biden supports destroyed their economies with shutdowns—and their states still have some of the highest death tolls in the country.

Republicans in Congress worked with @realDonaldTrump to rebuild America’s economy and create millions of new jobs once.  And we’re already doing it again.  Make no mistake: Under total Biden-Harris-Pelosi-Schumer control it will be higher taxes insane regulations and no growth. https://t.co/QcYeo1KVht,2020-10-22 23:19:10,Twitter for iPhone,28,107

Unbelievable. Kamala Harris STILL won’t say whether or not she and Joe Biden would pack the Supreme Court with extra liberal justices if they got the chance.  Her refusal to answer the simple question makes it clear: They would.   Scary. https://t.co/dH1GDEhfiY,2020-10-08 02:30:59,Twitter for iPhone,100,273
Let’s be clear: Biden would ban fracking &amp; destroy our oil/gas industry.  The result?

President Trump: - Law &amp; Order - Supports our brave police officers  Meanwhile Dems: - Embrace the radical defund the police movement - Won't denounce the mobs - Won't prosecute the looters - Call antifa a "myth" - Want to take your guns leaving you defenseless  Stark contrast. https://t.co/98Fgpc83zE,2020-09-30 03:27:59,Twitter for iPhone,235,588
🚨 WATCH → Joe Biden refuses to say if he'd oppose the far-left's radical plan to pack the courts to get their way if he wins.  He's controlled by the mobs.  Don't let him or the media tell you otherwise. https://t.co/0xwSKi7uQP,2020-09-30 03:10:35,Twitter for iPhone,111,302

Big congrats to @mowers on tonight’s primary victory! Looking forward to helping you win big in November and deliver on President Trump’s agenda - Let’s flip the seat &amp; fire Pelosi!,2020-09-09 01:48:11,Twitter for iPhone,74,387
First @BrianMastFL's opponent called for "open season" on Republicans.  Then Pelosi labeled Republicans "domestic enemies" of the state.  This unhinged rhetoric has real world consequences.  Republicans—including Brian Mast—were attacked by leftist mobs in the streets last night. https://t.co/wtQlowtxFs,2020-08-28 16:29:23,Twitter for iPhone,169,307
PROUD to be at the White House to watch @realDonaldTrump accept the Republican nomination for President of the United States.

America has been through tough times before. We need @realDonaldTrump to lead us out of the times we're facing now. He built the greatest economy in the history of our country once and he's already doing it again.,2020-08-25 01:59:45,Twitter Web App,37,215
When Biden chaired the Judiciary Committee he just made broken promises.  It was Trump who delivered criminal justice reform.  When Biden was VP he claimed to care about American workers while millions of jobs were shipped overseas.  It was Trump who brought those jobs back.,2020-08-25 01:57:20,Twitter Web App,39,122
Joe Biden has made a career in Washington for 47 years promising things he’s never delivered.  He's all talk.  Meanwhile @realDonaldTrump has delivered huge wins for American workers and families in just three short years.,2020-08-25 01:55:45,Twitter Web App,41,153
The radical left wants to defund the police. This is personal for me.  I wouldn’t be here without the law enforcement officers who saved my life.  @realDonaldTrump stands with those brave men and women. Joe Biden embraces the left’s insane mission to defund them. Scary contrast.,2020-08-25 01:54:15,Twitter Web App,63,213
I’ve seen @realDonaldTrump's compassion firsthand. After I was shot by a leftist gunman President Trump came to the hospital my first night there. He consoled my family—and checked on me for weeks. That’s the kind of person he is. That’s the side of him the media won't show you.,2020-08-25 01:53:13,Twitter Web App,98,404
Let’s be clear: This is an election between a party that wants to burn the foundations of America to the ground and a party that wants to rebuild and protect our great nation.,2020-08-25 01:52:33,Twitter Web App,782,2175
Republican Agenda: - Create jobs - Put American workers &amp; families first - Stand up to China - Restore law &amp; order  Democrat Agenda: - Attack Trump - Defund the police - "Dismantle" America  Stark contrast.

When Biden's own staff tells you he will destroy American energy jobs &amp; let our enemies regain dominance of the global energy supply believe them.  Biden's "energy plan" = AOC's Green New Deal.

There’s never been a more radical left-wing ticket in history. Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris make Obama look conservative.  He caves to every demand from the far-left.

Kamala Harris flip flops so much you can’t keep count.  The only thing you can count on her to do? Cave to whatever the far-left demands.  She used to be an attorney general. Now she embraces the movement to vilify law enforcement &amp; defund police.  Tells you all you need to know.,2020-08-11 21:42:26,Twitter for iPhone,108,289

Just when it seemed Dems couldn't be any more incompetent...  This week in Iowa they showed us they can't even count.  Yet these are the people who want to take over your healthcare and control every aspect of the economy?  No thanks. https://t.co/bRDd5aGEqu,2020-02-08 19:12:40,Twitter Media Studio,180,657
This Week: @realDonaldTrump was the only winner in Iowa.  Next Week: I'm headed to New Hampshire with @TeamTrump to keep the momentum going!  #KeepAmericaGreat 🇺🇸 https://t.co/G5HnG7eVsW,2020-02-07 22:30:48,Twitter for iPhone,5488,20820
Impeachment LSU football New Orleans food and beating Dems in 2020.  I joined the @NRSC's @20for20pod to discuss all that and more.  Listen here ↓https://t.co/jujS2Bv9PQ,2020-02-06 20:59:55,Twitter Web App,38,111
Don't let Pete Buttigieg tell you he's any less radical than the rest of the Dems running for president.  Protecting babies late in pregnancy and outside the womb from being killed shouldn't be a debate.  His answer to @MeghanMcCain's partial-birth abortion question is repulsive. https://t.co/GiR3TYu06r,2020-02-06 17:43:53,Twitter Web App,270,492
Big victory for @realDonaldTrump in Iowa! Dems are still having a total meltdown.   .@TeamTrump is headed to the #SOTU. America is on a roll! https://t.co/H72hvDmokR,2020-02-04 19:28:38,Twitter for iPhone,190,1209
What an absolute disaster for Democrats in Iowa.  RT if you think the people who can't even manage a caucus shouldn't be the ones managing our government. https://t.co/txDJhsrQxx,2020-02-04 16:13:18,Twitter for iPhone,359,634

Trump: Unleashed American energy dominance to create jobs lower household costs &amp; strengthen our allies.  Bernie Sanders: Wants to ban US oil exports &amp; reverse those wins.  Far-Left radical proposals like the #GreenNewDeal are bad for families our economy &amp; national security. https://t.co/sGfKkAW6dk,2020-01-30 23:37:02,Twitter for iPhone,56,127
🚨 Americans in battleground Michigan slam the Democrats' impeachment sham:  “You’ve got elderly who need help. You’ve got veterans who need help. You’ve got poor people who need help. Impeachment doesn’t really help a person who is struggling." https://t.co/uOnEBNKplU,2020-01-28 14:44:29,Twitter Web App,76,212
WATCH → Pro-Life woman asks Pete Buttigieg if there's room for her in the Democrat Party.  He doubled down on the Dems' extreme agenda of government-funded abortions up to the moment of birth.  This radical Democrat Party may not welcome #ProLife voters but Republicans will! https://t.co/KCmfL8q3Hu,2020-01-27 03:14:57,Twitter Media Studio,91,219
Democrats want to disrupt our entire healthcare system and kick people off their plans but can’t even tell us what it will cost. https://t.co/oMfSC8u7Av,2020-01-25 21:08:09,Twitter for iPhone,82,226
