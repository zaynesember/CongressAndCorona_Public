Here's the truth Dems won't tell you about their climate plan:  When their insane policies force American manufacturers to shut down manufacturing won't stop. It'll get shipped along with our good-paying jobs to countries like China that emit carbon at dramatically higher rates. https://t.co/Klyofg6aXR,2020-11-28 14:00:20,Twitter Media Studio,527,1175
This says it all:  Biden wants John Kerry—the man behind the disastrous Obama Iran deal—to call the shots on energy.  We'd be back to the same failed policies. - Dependent on foreign energy - Jobs/manufacturing sent overseas  America would be the loser. China would be the winner. https://t.co/EENRPJV2xm,2020-11-27 17:44:56,Twitter Media Studio,522,1352

The left and Comey’s FBI destroyed General Flynn’s life to try to take down @realDonaldTrump.  What happened to him never should have been allowed to happen in America.  Justice has been served.  It’s long overdue to hold the people behind it accountable.,2020-11-25 22:04:29,Twitter for iPhone,2445,8450
🚨 The media won't tell you this:  For months $138 BILLION in aid for workers/small businesses has just been sitting there unused because Pelosi is blocking it to play politics.

You can't call yourself a "moderate" when you vote with Pelosi and the squad over 90% of the time.  But that’s exactly what these so-called “moderate Dems” are trying to do.  Americans see right through them.  Socialism was rebuked this year. And it'll be rebuked in 2022 too. https://t.co/ohiEze5imZ,2020-11-20 18:14:30,Twitter Media Studio,442,1355

Big Tech won't show us the metrics on how many conservatives they censor compared to how many liberals they censor.  Yet they preach about transparency.  Give me a break.  They have a clear bias against conservatives—and they know those metrics would prove that. https://t.co/NZtI4ua9xE,2020-11-19 16:20:40,Twitter Media Studio,271,733
Twitter now claims they made a "mistake" censoring the Hunter Biden story.  What a joke.  Censor something once—that could be a mistake.

House Democrats can try to spin it however they want.  But they can't hide from their own voting records.  For two years they voted for a socialist agenda—and put their far-left political priorities over workers and families.

If you support President Trump they attack you in the street.  If you speak out on a college campus they shut you down.  If you refuse to go along with their radical agenda they "cancel" you.  This is today’s Left.  If the mob wins America loses. https://t.co/Sq743CvSfn,2020-11-17 15:38:29,Twitter Media Studio,859,2040
Last night @realDonaldTrump's supporters were attacked and beaten by left wing mobs on the streets of DC.  Where is the media outrage?  Why aren't Democrat leaders condemning it?  Political violence has no place in America. I've seen its consequences firsthand.,2020-11-15 14:56:28,Twitter for iPhone,13278,39998
Let me get this straight:  Cuomo on Monday—"We can't let this vaccination plan go forward."  Trump yesterday—"We won't be delivering it to New York until we have authorization to do so. That pains me to say that."  Yet the NY AG attacks Trump for what Cuomo said.  Unbelievable. https://t.co/6FVwkezmmm,2020-11-14 16:22:08,Twitter for iPhone,1295,2728
Turns out Americans prefer freedom low taxes and re-opening over socialism defund the police and lockdowns.  Voters rebuked Pelosi's radical agenda and sent a large class of Republicans to Congress.

Let me get this straight:  Huge potentially life-saving news for Americans is announced—COVID vaccine is 90% effective in trials.

The pollsters and the pundits said Republicans would LOSE 10-15 seats in the House.

🚨 Chuck Schumer yesterday: "Now we take Georgia then we change America!"

The election isn’t over until all legal votes are counted and certified. There are still serious legal challenges that have been made and until that process is resolved the election is not final.  The American people deserve a fair and transparent process.,2020-11-07 20:24:28,Twitter for iPhone,13573,37530
Every single American citizen should be demanding all of this:  - Transparency - Count all legal votes - Do not count any illegal votes - Observation of ballot sorting and counting by both parties - Election laws enforced as written  Republicans won’t quit fighting.,2020-11-06 18:40:54,Twitter for iPhone,4678,11773
Logic of a so-called "moderate" House Democrat:  1) Vote for a radical socialist agenda for 2 years.  2) Watch Americans reject it and elect Republicans.  3) Suddenly get angry at the agenda you've been voting for.  They're all talk. They'll keep voting for socialism. Just watch. https://t.co/bf8r6yUNFU,2020-11-06 17:20:56,Twitter Media Studio,238,670

Let's be clear.  Democrats are refusing to answer this simple question:  Would you pack the Supreme Court with extra liberal justices so you can always get your way?

Just look at Pelosi's last offer to see how unserious she is.  - Stimulus checks to illegal immigrants - Voter ID ban - Mass prison release - Failed blue state bailouts  Time for her to drop the absurd demands.

Embarrassing. → CNN CUOMO desperately tried to cover for GOV CUOMO—his brother—when @SenTedCruz brought up his order that killed thousands of seniors in nursing homes.

🚨 Pelosi is refusing to rule out impeaching @realDonaldTrump again solely to delay the Senate filling the Supreme Court vacancy.  Impeachment was never about a “crime” for Dems.  They only care about one thing: their own power—and they’ll stop at nothing to get it. Scary. https://t.co/5UEFmuzsUJ,2020-09-20 15:20:28,Twitter for iPhone,1371,2647

China: - Unleashed Coronavirus on the world - Lied to cover it up - Hoarded PPE for leverage - Tried to hack our vaccine - Corrupted the World Health Organization  Yet Dems block action to hold them accountable.

Let's get this straight:  This week Dems aren't doing a thing to help Americans.  What are they doing instead?  Wasting time on a useless resolution condemning the term "Wuhan Virus" when THEIR committee held a hearing titled "The Wuhan Coronavirus."

A pattern the media won't point out:  Whenever Republicans try to deliver aid to workers families and students Dems block it with partisan demands.  They're all talk. They don't actually care about helping people in need. Their only priority is their radical political agenda. https://t.co/bBIu2GzxO4,2020-09-14 15:54:15,Twitter Media Studio,645,1120

Make no mistake: Dems are using the virus to try to ram through the same partisan election scheme they cooked up LAST year.  They want to mail ballots to all "registered voters."  Yet at least 378 counties have more "registered voters" than voting age citizens.  Let that sink in. https://t.co/cUMrwLmmrp,2020-09-09 19:03:33,Twitter Media Studio,1526,1875

Twice in one interview Biden says “yes” &amp; “yes absolutely” to questions about “redirecting” police funding.

Joe Biden wants to have it both ways.  He wants to embrace the far-left.  But he doesn’t want to say “defund the police.”   So he says he’s going to “redirect” police funds instead.

Burning cities to the ground is not "peaceful protesting"—no matter how many times the media calls it that.  But the Dems who run these cities are too scared to stand up to the mobs to stop it.

Dems and the media expect you to believe their No-ID universal mail voting scheme isn't a mess.  What a joke.

The media won't tell you this story:  @realDonaldTrump was one of the first people to visit me in the hospital the day I was shot by a leftist gunman.

🚨 Today in Pelosi's House:  Dems called an "emergency" session to play politics and hand USPS $25 BILLION of taxpayer money.

Here’s what Dems won’t tell you:  There’s $500+ BILLION in unspent funds from past Coronavirus bills that can be used flexibly—including to help states.

Dems' demands: - Mail-in/No-ID voting - Stimulus checks to illegal immigrants - Green New Deal provisions - Tax breaks for blue state millionaires - $ for sanctuary cities - $ for pot industry  What a joke.

Your tax dollars shouldn’t be going to schools unwilling to figure out how to safely re-open and serve your kids.

That’s NOT just politics.  You know a Democrat is in trouble when even MSNBC is calling them out. https://t.co/oLCuJ9k0xn,2020-06-22 15:34:23,Twitter Media Studio,3489,5942
🚨 Alarming Data 🚨 → 40% of COVID deaths have come from nursing homes → 20000 deaths were avoidable  Numbers don't lie. Cuomo does.  He violated protocol &amp; forced COVID patients into nursing homes—now he's trying to cover up the horrific outcome.  He must be held accountable. https://t.co/WLX927GPPS,2020-06-21 22:19:47,Twitter for iPhone,14792,22573
Outrageous. → First Cuomo forced COVID-19 patients into nursing homes—causing 6000+ deaths. Now he’s dismissing their families as “shiny objects” for wanting answers.  New York seniors and their families have a fighter in @EliseStefanik. We won’t let him get away with this. https://t.co/IDO0RoEYPd,2020-06-19 17:49:38,Twitter for iPhone,606,1423

The guidelines were clear: You don't force COVID-19 positive patients into nursing homes.  But that's exactly what Governor Cuomo did.   Now thousands of seniors are dead who shouldn't be—and he's hiding the data so families can't see the truth.  He has a lot of explaining to do. https://t.co/juIYTDk3lQ,2020-06-17 22:04:57,Twitter for iPhone,897,1505
40% of COVID-19 nursing home deaths came from just five states.  New York New Jersey Michigan California and Pennsylvania.

40% of COVID-19 deaths have come from nursing homes even though they represent just 0.6% of the population.  Why?

Let's be clear: The federal government issued specific guidelines to protect seniors in nursing homes from COVID-19—but Governor Cuomo completely ignored them.

Let's be clear: As families &amp; small businesses struggled Dems held relief hostage for days to play politics &amp; try to sneak their liberal wish list into this emergency bill.

Schumer on Saturday: “There's been a great deal of bipartisan cooperation" on the relief bill.  Schumer Today: Blocked that same relief bill he &amp; Senate Dems co-wrote TWICE.  What changed?

What’s in Nancy Pelosi's bill to supposedly deal with Coronavirus? – Mandates climate change studies – Forces airlines to spend money on carbon offsets—not workers – Massive union giveaways  She's holding the American people’s well-being hostage to her liberal agenda. Shameless.,2020-03-23 20:39:47,Twitter Web App,8362,15452
🚨 Dems just blocked the emergency Coronavirus bill YET AGAIN.

DISGRACEFUL.,2020-03-23 18:55:46,Twitter Web App,7771,15128
Why isn't Congress acting quickly? Pelosi &amp; Schumer are exploiting this crisis to play politics.

Let’s be clear about what’s happening right now: We had a bipartisan deal to deliver critical relief to hardworking families until Nancy Pelosi blew it up so she could play politics.  Enough already!

Make no mistake: Congress is working to get relief to families &amp; small businesses fast.  After Katrina we let banks push back loan payments so businesses could cover expenses &amp; keep employees.

Dems dragged America through a sham impeachment. And failed.  But instead of dropping it and getting back to work they're already calling for more.  More investigations. More hearings.
