@RachelLaing @dillonliam What does your “friend” 😏think are the substantive legal issues in building a housing project consistent with zoning and approved plans in downtown SD or LJ or Pt. Loma?,2020-04-29 03:03:43,Twitter for iPhone,0,2
@RachelLaing It just makes housing in particular more uncertain and expensive and ultimately less likely to be built at all. If you must disallow project level changes only in urban or suburban areas.,2020-04-29 03:00:54,Twitter for iPhone,0,2
@RachelLaing Gah. Do your CEQA on every general plan community plan and zoning change. Have your litigation. Once it’s done never allow any legal challenge to any project that’s consistent with those plans. What is the point of litigation at that point by a judge or a kinda judge?,2020-04-29 02:58:33,Twitter for iPhone,0,7

Surfers ask me to open the beaches.

@xsdutOsborne @drolland That’s a legitimate question. During one of the budget downturns in the last decade we talked about giving misdemeanors to Dumanis.

@ColinParent @CirculateSD 1. Remind your team that if you’re making real change people are going to grumble. Sadly vitriol is how some people grumble online. 2. As boss you can defend them when you see them abused and it bugs them. 3. Fuggetaboutit. Never let the noise interfere with your vital work.,2020-02-01 19:23:04,Twitter for iPhone,0,26

As a former trial lawyer I find this astonishing. Representing a client in a case of disputed facts where you are a direct witness to those very facts - without disclosing!
