Her spirit led a cultural movement for equal rights in the 1970s and that same spirit carried on to inspire generations to this day.

(8/12) This is because methane a main component in natural gas is a super pollutant far more potent &amp; harmful than CO2. To take advantage of what natural gas offers it's vital that commonsense regulations are in place to ensure fugitive natural gas emissions are under control.,2020-09-16 23:51:45,Twitter Web App,1,2
(7/12) Natural gas presents itself as a “bridge fuel” that could help us move to a more sustainable future. While natural gas burns cleaner than coal any climate benefits are wasted if more than 3.2% escapes through fugitive emissions. https://t.co/f9yV30rkun,2020-09-16 23:51:45,Twitter Web App,1,2

We've voted on 4 pieces of emergency legislation since Feb. to properly respond to #COVID19 and we know there’s much more work to do. #AutomaticStabilizers would expedite this process and not hold up desperately needed aid while negotiations take place. https://t.co/hyC8vDI8yT,2020-05-15 21:00:01,Twitter Web App,0,4
Even @federalreserve Chair Jerome Powell testified Wednesday it was going to take big action by Congress to address the economic damage done by the #coronavirus. #AutomaticStabilizers is a big proactive solution offering immediate and long-term relief. https://t.co/Lyx2OsiyBO,2020-05-15 20:12:12,Twitter Web App,0,9
Economists agree: the best way to combat the financial crisis facing our country is to build #AutomaticStabilizers into #COVID19 response legislation.  https://t.co/DmlanPyB6F,2020-05-15 19:46:04,Twitter Web App,2,9
Since day one my colleagues of the @NewDemCoalition and I have fought #ForThePeople to ensure continuous funding for #PPP and #Unemployment via #AutomaticStabilizers so aid quickly reaches those who need it most quickly unhindered by partisan politics. https://t.co/qe1v570dYt,2020-05-15 19:19:15,Twitter Web App,4,14
Unfortunately common-sense fiscally-responsible #AutomaticStabilizers - which would provide rolling relief to millions of families and essential workers until economic cues trigger them off - failed to make it into today's package. https://t.co/wzYvzeSqhh,2020-05-15 19:02:12,Twitter Web App,3,10

#ICYMI: This timely piece explains why automatic triggers are so critical for the success of federal #COVID relief... and is exactly why we urged for the inclusion of automatic stabilizers in our letter to the Speaker this morning: https://t.co/NyMJkqNXKN https://t.co/lYOZuSsv6f,2020-05-12 00:04:12,Twitter Web App,4,8
#FYI: @SanDiegoAirport remains open &amp; operational.

The #coronavirus pandemic has uprooted the lives of many Americans and our country will feel the impacts of the damage for years to come. Nearly all economists agree: Congress needs to go big to save our economy. (6/7),2020-05-11 18:30:33,Twitter Web App,1,9
During the last recession Congress had to extend emergency unemployment benefits +10 times. As the weak labor market wore on it became more difficult for Congress to meet consensus and act.   We cannot afford to make the same mistake twice. (5/7),2020-05-11 18:30:33,Twitter Web App,0,9
Adopting automatic stabilizers would do just that - keep federal funding for crucial programs flowing for the duration of the current financial crisis until an economic trigger signals the additional stimulus is no longer needed and can be shut off. (4/7),2020-05-11 18:30:32,Twitter Web App,1,9
We know the optimal recession-fighting tools are existing countercyclical programs like UI FMAP SNAP etc. To revive our economy it will be imperative to establish rolling federal aid that enhances these programs as they become more widely needed in the months ahead.
