I’ll end with this.   My team and I have dealt with GSA under her leadership for years and we made every effort to do so in good faith. But her subservience to the president was a permanent and insurmountable hurdle in our efforts to cooperate.,2020-11-22 20:57:26,Twitter for iPad,2313,14015
Admin Murphy told Congress that the president was not involved in discussions to scrap the relocation plan.

Trump’s proposal was to replace the Hoover building with a new one. We were concerned that he was pressuring GSA into complying because he feared the competition of another hotel being built so close to his own.

First you need to know that Trump nearly bid on the Hoover Building himself as part of the relocation.   And when he cancelled the project he was actively refusing to end his lease on another GSA property up the street:  Trump International Hotel.  https://t.co/IprrrmRhkc https://t.co/XyNO5Mn62U,2020-11-22 20:57:23,Twitter for iPad,1004,6648
In 2017 Trump cancelled plans to relocate the FBI headquarters from the crumbling (literally) Hoover Building in DC to suburbs in VA or MD. Fine — normally presidents have that right.

No @GSAEmily.  You did not take an oath to “the administration that hired you.” You took an oath to the Constitution.

With each inspector general he removes President Trump furthers his systematic dismemberment of the structures of accountability in government.

So saddened to learn of the passing of Vienna’s George Lovelace. George served 14 years on the Town Council and in 1996 was elected as the first African American from NOVA to the Virginia House of Delegates. A quiet trailblazer.

So let me get this straight. Trump doesn’t like people mixing up faith and politics while he touts the acquitted headline at a prayer breakfast. Can someone check the definition of hypocrisy please?  https://t.co/dJR4jvhCcV,2020-02-07 03:01:25,Twitter for iPhone,11,59

Dr. King understood the scam behind so-called “right-to-work” laws. They are an attack on our civil rights.   Our economy is fairer and our society freer when workers are empowered. #PROAct #1u https://t.co/D9GKvSn1RF,2020-02-06 18:26:43,Twitter Media Studio,12,35

I refuse to tolerate any insinuation that Americans especially children choose to experience poverty. No parent and certainly no child has ever made that choice.

Alan Dershowitz argues that "if a president does something that he thinks will help him get elected in the public interest that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that results in impeachment."   Sound familiar? https://t.co/rWQdrqcrOO,2020-01-30 15:54:39,TweetDeck,66,129
