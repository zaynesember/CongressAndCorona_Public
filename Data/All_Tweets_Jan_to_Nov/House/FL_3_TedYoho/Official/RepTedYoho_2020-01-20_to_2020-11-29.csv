I commend the @PeaceCorps for discontinuing operations in #China. China isn't a developing nation by any standard &amp; has more than enough resources to provide for its own people rather than rely on taxpayer-funded missions that should be serving populations with greater needs.,2020-01-22 17:07:04,Twitter Web App,12,22
Today we honor the life and legacy of a great American Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. His message of hope justice equality and service to others still inspire us today. Dr. King would have turned 91 this year. #MLKDay https://t.co/pX6KsWc11S,2020-01-20 14:54:02,Twitter for iPhone,6,14
