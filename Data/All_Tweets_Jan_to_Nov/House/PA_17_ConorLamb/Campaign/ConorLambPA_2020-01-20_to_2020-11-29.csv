The admin you support does use "always" to mean "maybe." Remember when POTUS said he'd "always" protect Social Security &amp; Medicare? Now he's draining SS funding &amp; overturning the ACA which would cut Medicare &amp; raise costs for seniors.  "Always" is worth nothing to these people.,2020-09-28 22:01:32,Twitter Web App,73,313
Well not "ALWAYS" since that would include right now when people are protected and you &amp; the admin are trying to overturn that protection.  After overturning the law: You. Have. No. Plan.  You had it right on Saturday: You don't know how to answer this question. #PA17 https://t.co/VSWtRNWlCx,2020-09-28 21:55:42,Twitter Web App,112,610

Western PA has supported #SocialSecurity since its creation. Westmoreland County's own Sen. Joe Guffey (17) was there 85 years ago as FDR signed it into law.

85 yrs ago we made a promise: you pay into #SocialSecurity &amp; your benefits are guaranteed by the gov't.  Now President Trump &amp; his allies want to break that promise take from the fund &amp; cut "entitlements" if reelected.  That's not how we treat promises in western PA. #SocSec85,2020-08-14 17:55:56,Twitter Web App,104,381

In PA actions speak louder than tweets. Obama-Biden actions supported a boom in gas &amp; clean energy jobs. Workers who did best were in unions which you oppose &amp; Biden has always fought for.

Finally we need to remember what’s always been true: the public health solution &amp; and the economic solution are the same.   Masks testing &amp; tracing will get our kids back in school &amp; people back at work.

As businesses reopen &amp; employees come back they NEED fast reliable testing &amp; tracing — most of which happens at the state &amp; local level.   They need kids back in school.  None of this works without funding for state &amp; local governments.,2020-07-10 15:29:03,Twitter Web App,4,28
But we can’t give up. Testing is not just about health but about jobs &amp; schools.   A Nobel laureate says each additional test supports 9 jobs. Germany keeps its schools open with constant testing.   The President won’t do this so we have to support our governors.,2020-07-10 15:29:03,Twitter Web App,2,20
OTOH we spent billions on testing &amp; sacrificed trillions in economic activity but we’re going backward. Lack of a national strategy &amp; commitment is to blame.

Glad that @SecAzar came to #PA17 today to address the issues we've been raising.   Disappointed they wouldn't let me join so I could advocate for my constituents.

The US has to be a place where justice is done. It's a core part of our strength in the world. We never claim to be perfect but we always strive to be better.

Police officers are speaking up &amp; saying there is no excuse for what was done to George Floyd. Prosecutors should too.   We are more than capable of meeting the demand to see justice done more fairly &amp; more quickly.  Make an arrest.,2020-05-29 15:16:37,Twitter Web App,190,1146

For those who don't know @Darrinkellypgh is an active duty Pittsburgh Firefighter &amp; the President of @AlleghenyLabor.  This is what he does when he's NOT working.

Joined @Darrinkellypgh &amp; @AlleghenyLabor today for an emergency food distribution.   Unions don't just take care of their members. They take care of our communities.

To our #PA17 constituents who may have seen this today: It is a lie. Conor did not vote for the bill.  We are running against an all-out disinformation campaign.

The demand for PPE &amp; testing components will only increase as do mass testing &amp; contact tracing to we can start to reopen our economy.   We need a national plan NOW to meet that demand for months and months ahead. https://t.co/res4Hnb2OD,2020-04-30 18:44:14,Twitter for iPhone,58,153
If the national stockpile is low the federal government’s message should be:  We’re taking the lead to replenish it. Here are our target numbers here’s our plan we’ll stop at nothing to get there.  Instead the message right now is: You’re on your own. https://t.co/res4Hnb2OD,2020-04-30 18:43:39,Twitter for iPhone,27,81
Stopping future outbreaks means the need for PPE &amp; testing will INCREASE not decrease.  As need increases it makes no sense for Governors to compete for what we all need.   In war we give every commander the best intel &amp; every soldier the best weapon. This is no different.,2020-04-28 21:35:36,Twitter Web App,27,115
Why isn’t the admin also using DPA to fix testing &amp; PPE shortages?  Goal isn’t only to reopen now but to STAY open. Staying open means more testing &amp; more PPE for people doing those tests.   &amp; more PPE for all workers whether in meat processing manufacturing or elsewhere https://t.co/rmLmndsAqm,2020-04-28 21:35:35,Twitter Web App,54,161
State &amp; local govts are doing the work the admin won’t do yet @senatemajldr would let them go bankrupt.   It’s time for him &amp; his crowd to lead follow or get out of the way  Our next bill should bypass this admin &amp; get money directly to states local govts &amp; the American people,2020-04-24 20:55:32,Twitter for iPhone,1498,5015
I just learned that Pennsylvania has been told not to expect any more masks gloves &amp; gowns from the national stockpile.

Research from Morgan Stanley &amp; others says we need to be doing at least 500K tests per day in the short term.  We need a battle plan to get there with checkpoints &amp; clear ways to measure if our strategy is succeeding.  Right now we have the opposite. We are flying blind.,2020-04-21 23:44:31,Twitter for iPhone,66,233
In other words even after we've all been talking about testing &amp; PPE for a month &amp; a half the administration either has no goals or isn’t willing to share them with the public or even with Congress.,2020-04-21 23:44:31,Twitter for iPhone,78,217
A Republican Representative said: You must have a need. How many masks did you need 3 weeks ago &amp; how many do you need today?  Again no numbers.,2020-04-21 23:44:31,Twitter for iPhone,33,120
On a call today w/ FEMA supply chain task force a Senator repeatedly asked: How many testing components &amp; PPE do you expect we'll need going forward &amp; is there a plan to get there?  They had no numbers — at all. Not even an estimate which means no specific manufacturing goals.,2020-04-21 23:44:31,Twitter for iPhone,262,598
Thank you @InsulatorsL.   When I called to ask if they had PPE they could donate only question they asked: "Where can we meet you?"  Even when their members are getting laid off &amp; the future is uncertain they help fellow workers &amp; the community.

That's why I cosponsored @TimRyan's bill to require the President to use the #DefenseProductionAct to order medical equipment &amp; PPE.   Hope this bill won't be necessary &amp; the President will do the right thing. But we can't afford to wait any longer. 4/4 #coronavirus #COVID19,2020-03-24 19:23:54,Twitter Web App,8,53
I called a career training school &amp; they had 4 ventilators — now on their way to our health care providers.   Every donation helps. But for context NY currently needs 30K ventilators.  ONLY the President can get us the supplies we need — &amp; we need him to do it NOW. 3/4,2020-03-24 19:23:53,Twitter Web App,6,53
I can't understand why the President refuses to do the same for PPE &amp; ventilators. If you know a doctor nurse medical tech 1st responder: their lives depend on getting PPE now not in 18 months.   He needs to make massive orders with immediate deadlines https://t.co/yam7PLRzsD,2020-03-24 19:23:53,Twitter Web App,5,31
Good to see reports that FEMA is using the #DefenseProductionAct to get more test kits.   Mass testing will determine how quickly we can restart our economy. Our workers will be better off knowing everyone on the job site or in the office is healthy &amp; not spreading the virus. 1/4,2020-03-24 19:23:53,Twitter Web App,21,107
Picked up a ton of new donations today from @dc57iupat training center @SFTSDNews @RosedaleTech @deerlakessd &amp; @Hampton_Talbots. Another truckload from @CCAC.

Aliquippa #PA17 is where the NLRA was fought &amp; won. Now western PA will again be the proving ground for the argument that when any workers organize all workers benefit.
