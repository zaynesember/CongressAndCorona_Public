While we celebrate this decision we must continue to fight the ongoing threats to our environment and communities. As Chair of the Committee with oversight of the Corps of Engineers &amp; the Clean Water Act I will always fight to protect our environment &amp; the public. #PebbleMine,2020-11-25 22:18:19,Twitter Web App,0,6
The Corps of Engineers has made it clear that a foreign mining company with highly dubious business plans cannot be allowed to damage an irreplaceable habitat and the ancestral home of many Alaskan Natives. But make no mistake our work isn’t done. #PebbleMine,2020-11-25 22:18:18,Twitter Web App,1,10
