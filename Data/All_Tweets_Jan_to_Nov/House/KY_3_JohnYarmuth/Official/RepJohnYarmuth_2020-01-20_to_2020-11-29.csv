This Thanksgiving may be different than others but I hope everyone is finding a way to celebrate while staying safe and healthy. I’m thankful for my family our frontline workers and the continued honor of representing the city I love in Congress. Happy Thanksgiving!,2020-11-26 14:40:17,Twitter for iPhone,7,102
Congratulations to Louisville’s own—and fellow @atherton_high alum—@jackharlow on earning a @RecordingAcad GRAMMY nomination for Best Rap Performance. We are so proud of all you have accomplished. https://t.co/LgP8L1UEle,2020-11-24 19:11:36,Twitter for iPhone,20,143
You’re right. More than 80000000 Americans already determined that three weeks ago. https://t.co/FSdkkQ6Q9r,2020-11-24 15:34:53,Twitter Web App,23,245

This Transgender Day of Remembrance we honor the lives of members of the trans and gender diverse communities taken from us far too soon. We all need to do far more to rid the world of transphobia and transphobic violence.

“President Trump won by a landslide.”  Not a single Kentucky Republican has spoken out against this effort to undermine our democracy. This is YOUR party organization. Are you proud of it? https://t.co/w8Ac4JorqP,2020-11-20 16:24:40,Twitter for iPhone,39,319
Mitch McConnell is blocking COVID relief for Kentucky families because he wants complete legal immunity for every business — even if that company is so reckless that its managers allegedly bet on how many workers get COVID each day. https://t.co/nQkIBgOjKi,2020-11-20 00:50:12,Twitter for iPhone,68,189
Today brings more terrifying and heartbreaking numbers. I’m thankful for @GovAndyBeshear's continued leadership in making the tough decisions to protect Kentucky families.

The GOP can and must stop the delusion and return to reality. Lives livelihoods and American democracy depend on it.  9/9,2020-11-11 22:02:15,Twitter Web App,12,91
Cooperation and a seamless transition of power can provide the President-elect's team vital support to save lives. Denying reality and forcing federal agencies to stand in the way instead of helping in every way is delusional dangerous and deadly. 8/X,2020-11-11 22:01:46,Twitter Web App,6,74
And while it is truly disgraceful for Republican leaders to allow a defeated President to shred our constitution and democracy with their blessing that they would do so as the pandemic rages—with so many Americans' livelihoods and lives on the line—is psychopathic. 7/X,2020-11-11 22:01:17,Twitter Web App,5,51

We need the White House and Congress focused on saving lives jobs and businesses; keeping families in their homes. We need all hands on deck. Americans cannot afford us to delay to give unjustifiable credence to the hollow gripes of the world’s sorest loser. 5/X,2020-11-11 22:00:12,Twitter Web App,6,57

What would be devastating for our nation at any time is deadly for our citizenry today. These are the once-in-a-generation moments when our leaders must rise above pettiness for the good of a country. 3/X,2020-11-11 21:57:36,Twitter Web App,10,60
Aside from the crises we face Republican officials have betrayed their oaths to the constitution and continue to undermine the most sacred pillars of American democracy in the eyes of the world for nearly nothing—to send fundraising emails and appease Trump's fragile ego. 2/X,2020-11-11 21:56:16,Twitter Web App,15,76
We face a worsening pandemic &amp; a weak economic recovery that is now slowing. This is when gov't can be the difference between life/death for hundreds of thousands.

Enough with this bogus claim you idiot. The cause of death is what actually caused your death.

The WH has given up on controlling COVID as we experience the largest loss of American life since WWII — more than 4000 people a week.   75 years ago they died to save the world from Nazis.

Today there still is no plan. Nothing has been released. No new ideas have been proposed.,2020-10-09 16:57:14,Twitter Web App,9,57
On September 15 2020 referencing his plan at a town hall event Trump said “I have it all ready and it’s a much better plan for you.” https://t.co/RQpvnRa57C,2020-10-09 16:56:50,Twitter Web App,5,29

President Trump and Mitch McConnell have now officially killed negotiations on a deal to provide relief for the American people.  No $1200 checks.  No $600 unemployment benefit.

“Stand back and stand by" isn’t a condemnation it’s an order from a superior.

Thousands of Americans are dying each day millions are out of work and the only bit of effort President Trump and Mitch McConnell show is to attempt to swiftly replace Justice Ginsburg before she’s even been laid to rest.

I join the many who demand change so that no one has to face the same "legal" fate as Breonna Taylor in our community or anywhere else ever again. [4/4],2020-09-23 19:49:17,Twitter Web App,51,421
No Breonna Taylor's killing was neither moral nor ethical and it's past time for the law to reflect that. Breonna did not deserve to be killed in her home. She deserves justice. [3/4],2020-09-23 19:48:41,Twitter Web App,88,415
In no sense could this be considered moral or ethical. That this killing has been deemed "legal" that an officer involved could *still* feel that her death was justified shows how very very far we still have to go. [2/4],2020-09-23 19:48:12,Twitter Web App,68,398
Yesterday a day before a grand jury chose not to charge him one of the officers who broke into Breonna Taylor's home and shot her to death wrote "I know we did the legal moral and ethical thing that night." [1/4],2020-09-23 19:47:43,Twitter Web App,198,570
Please stay strong. Please stay safe. Please know that I will be your ally along the way. 11/11,2020-09-23 01:24:21,Twitter Web App,19,278
Peace can be Breonna’s legacy if we make it so. As her mother Tamika Palmer said: “Breonna devoted her own life to saving other lives to helping others to making people smile and bringing people together. The last thing she’d want to see right now is any more violence.” 10/11,2020-09-23 01:23:34,Twitter Web App,28,222
Justice for Breonna will not be done until Black Louisvillians can feel as comfortable in their neighborhoods homes and skin as I feel in mine. This movement — angry but focused peaceful but never passive — makes me believe we will get there. But only if it continues. 9/11,2020-09-23 01:21:09,Twitter Web App,62,306
The emotional trauma our Black community has experienced since March (and before)—the shootings the response to protests the deliberate focus on a few troublemakers over the nonviolent movement and *what* is being protested must be as exhausting as it is infuriating. 8/11,2020-09-23 01:20:35,Twitter Web App,24,215
It is clear to me that you are the ones we’ve been waiting for. It is my deepest hope that you will continue to peacefully assemble and remain focused on the changes our society so desperately needs. You will do so with my full support. 7/11,2020-09-23 01:19:46,Twitter Web App,24,264
Third whatever the decision from the grand jury is this cannot be the end of this movement. 6/11,2020-09-23 01:19:16,Twitter Web App,19,190
Local activists are walking in the footsteps of giants of nonviolent resistance. Dr. King my friend John Lewis leaders who gave us Civil Rights voting rights and so much more. Our own Muhammad Ali and Georgia Powers who fought for something bigger than themselves… 5/11,2020-09-23 01:18:36,Twitter Web App,17,204
Second the community movement that’s risen up in the wake of Breonna’s death has been an inspiration—focused determined peaceful effective. Impassioned Louisvillians came together to open eyes change minds and secure reforms that will save lives. 4/11,2020-09-23 01:17:56,Twitter Web App,31,242
Justice for Breonna means ensuring that there are no more who suffer her fate and a public safety system that views Black people not as threats but neighbors to serve and protect . We have already made progress in that direction but we have so far to go. 3/11,2020-09-23 01:16:36,Twitter Web App,32,256
First any decision on these 3 officers cannot bring justice for Breonna Taylor—and I don’t just mean it won’t bring her back. Too many things happened before they ever knocked on her door to put our hopes for justice on the fate of 3 individuals. The system must change. 2/11,2020-09-23 01:15:39,Twitter Web App,25,282
It is expected that the Grand Jury decision in the Breonna Taylor case will be announced soon. I have no inside information on the exact timing or what that decision will be but there are some things that are clear to me at this point.  1/11,2020-09-23 01:14:54,Twitter Web App,223,740

President Trump did not create or invent the coronavirus.

The destructive #TrumpBudget goes after working families &amp; breaks the President's promises to the American people. @HouseDemocrats will stand firm against the President’s cuts to Medicare Medicaid &amp; Social Security and his warped ‘vision’ for our nation’s future. https://t.co/wQV8iKhBr2,2020-02-12 12:59:00,TweetDeck,1361,3068

Proud to vote for the bipartisan bill I cosponsored the Protecting the Right to Organize Act. Empowering workers by allowing them to unionize provides higher wages better benefits &amp; safer working conditions. We need an economy where everyone succeeds not just the top. #PROAct https://t.co/BEnfBdg2Bl,2020-02-07 02:12:13,Twitter for iPhone,43,158

Based on my calculations if Democrats had say shouted “You lie!” at every mistruth President Trump told last night it would have doubled the length of his State of the Union address. https://t.co/EUggkbH9jf,2020-02-05 15:55:06,Twitter Web App,33,187

Today the U.S. Senate became a wholly owned subsidiary of Trump Inc. We should all fear for the survival of our Constitution and our democracy. https://t.co/rD3j9xu9Vk,2020-02-01 00:15:33,Twitter for iPhone,100,427

This #HolocaustRemembranceDay we recognize the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau and renew our vow to never forget the six million Jewish victims and millions of other victims of Nazism. Anti-Semitism and hate should have no home on this earth. #WeRemember https://t.co/70DAuJqRQb,2020-01-27 17:11:15,TweetDeck,22,96
Today marks 10yrs since SCOTUS’s disastrous Citizens United decision. Outside groups have spent more than $4.4 BILLION trying to buy our elections since then inc. $63M in KY. We must #EndCitizensUnited and Sen. McConnell must pass #HR1 immediately. Give power back to the people. https://t.co/BzC4RK4VFA,2020-01-21 17:58:32,TweetDeck,35,99
I’m beginning to think that Dershowitz was chosen because he’s the only lawyer on the planet who will say abuse of power is not impeachable.,2020-01-20 15:40:36,Twitter for iPhone,43,262
