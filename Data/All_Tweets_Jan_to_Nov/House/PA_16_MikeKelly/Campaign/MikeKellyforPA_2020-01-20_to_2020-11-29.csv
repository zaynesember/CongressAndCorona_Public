Anything less will be a stain on our electoral system that will do irreparable harm to our republic. I stand with @realdonaldtrump during this process. (3/3),2020-11-06 03:17:56,Twitter for iPhone,5,22
This election is not over and our president and the American people should not quit. We all need to play through the "echo of the whistle" to ensure that this election is free and fair where every LEGAL vote is counted. That is the only acceptable outcome.

Thread: Growing up in western Pa my football coaches taught me to "play not just through the whistle but through the echo of the whistle!” They said there’s no quitting. To stay on it stay on it stay on it. Don't ever quit! (1/3),2020-11-06 03:17:55,Twitter for iPhone,16,37

They say that 90% of life is showing up because when you show up people know you care.  @realDonaldTrump made history tonight in Butler PA as the first sitting president to visit OUR town.  This president shows up for us. NOW it’s time we show up for him - on Election Day! https://t.co/M6o7LgKqPu,2020-11-01 03:40:33,Twitter for iPhone,268,882

Seems that Joe Biden has some explaining to do. He’s taking responsibility for putting together "the most extensive and inclusive voter fraud organization in the history of American politics.” What? https://t.co/We7hT8Ojcv,2020-10-24 21:47:33,Twitter for iPad,377,733
Joe Biden should apologize for insulting millions of Pennsylvanians who support @POTUS @realDonaldTrump. I’m proud to be one of those “chumps” (deplorables?) who will choose to Make America Great Again over the Biden/Harris socialist agenda. https://t.co/MbNs0ucDUu,2020-10-24 17:51:15,Twitter for iPhone,480,1329
One of our top priorities should be protecting the right to life for the unborn.

.@POTUS @realDonaldTrump returns to Erie on October 20! I like to say that 90% of life is showing up because when you show up people know you care. This president has consistently shown up and fought for hard-working western Pennsylvanians and has never taken us for granted.,2020-10-16 21:42:20,Twitter Web App,5,11
Folks this is what we are up against in our fight to re-elect @realDonaldTrump.  This is yet another example of Big Tech censoring information it deems insufficiently friendly to their preferred presidential candidate Joe Biden.  https://t.co/m8MNTcUqMu,2020-10-14 21:04:46,Twitter Web App,41,57

Joe Biden said this week that Wabtec's Erie plant was "thinking of shutting down." That was news to Wabtec which called it "an integral part of the business and our community." Workers aren't political pawns. Biden should apologize to Local UE 506 and retract this false claim.,2020-10-13 19:17:51,Twitter Web App,29,65
I just spoke with @POTUS @realDonaldTrump. He loves Pennsylvania and knows that to Make America Great we need a thriving Keystone State. He doesn’t take us for granted. Let’s give him four more years by keeping PA red!,2020-10-12 18:47:32,Twitter for iPad,137,326
Kamala Harris says she and Joe won’t raise taxes on anyone making below $400000 per year but they want to repeal the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which let middle and low income workers keep far more of their hard-earned money. They can’t do both!,2020-10-08 02:12:00,Twitter for iPhone,2,8
Fracking has helped make western Pennsylvania part of the Great American Comeback! The Biden/Harris Green New Deal will eliminate thousands of energy jobs in our region. Say no to Joe! https://t.co/OyabUoeeQU,2020-10-08 01:43:01,Twitter for iPhone,470,1089
Sometimes we just need someone to fight for us. I will continue to do that for western Pennsylvanians here at home and in our nation's capital. https://t.co/ni7evModl9,2020-10-07 13:20:48,Twitter Web App,5,12
Let’s keep PA working by standing w/ @realDonaldTrump and saying no to Joe and his Green New Deal. Though Biden tried to distance himself from the GND last night he can’t hide that Kamala Harris helped write it his party is for it and his website calls it a “crucial framework.”,2020-09-30 19:50:58,Twitter for iPad,49,79

🚨A federal judge declared Gov.
