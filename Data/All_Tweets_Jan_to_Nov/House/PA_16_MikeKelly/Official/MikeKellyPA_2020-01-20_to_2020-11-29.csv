America is the most prepared nation on earth to confront #coronavirus and the threat to the general public remains low. Congress must act to keep it that way.  Democrats should stop playing politics with funding that will help state &amp; local governments keep our communities safe. https://t.co/zLQcyyfPJS,2020-03-04 16:35:42,Twitter Web App,187,736
Steps to prevent the spread of #coronavirus are similar to those we take to avoid colds the flu and other illnesses. https://t.co/J7dBtqOuJD https://t.co/MaCHp2xhpp,2020-03-04 16:25:45,Twitter Web App,5,10

Communist regimes have inflicted misery and death on millions of people. This ideology has no redeeming quality and should be resolutely condemned.   House Democrats just sided with Bernie Sanders and Fidel Castro over freedom-starved Cubans. https://t.co/GPXkybYsX3,2020-02-27 22:03:11,Twitter for iPhone,352,840
Medicare for All is really Medicare for None. It would destroy the program seniors depend on &amp; limit healthcare options for everyone.  Americans want us to build on what works in our healthcare system &amp; fix what doesn't not replace their plans &amp; providers with D.C. bureaucrats. https://t.co/G2vikxNwIR,2020-02-27 17:13:54,Twitter Web App,26,45

We won't be able to defend ourselves if we don't have strong steel strong farms &amp; strong manufacturing. It's just a fact of life.

The Phase One trade deal has new enforcement tools to allow the U.S. to quickly &amp; effectively act on behalf of American workers &amp; farmers if China violates the agreement or engages in other unfair practices.  This is a crucial first step in re-balancing our trade relationship!,2020-02-26 16:39:19,Twitter Web App,8,46
Liberal state &amp; local governments are forcing faith-based adoption &amp; foster care organizations to choose between their religious convictions and shutting down.

The Tax Cuts &amp; Jobs Act lowered tax rates so job creators would return to America after decades of fleeing to more tax-friendly shores. That's exactly what is happening.  Democrats say these businesses don't pay enough in taxes but they won't pay anything if they aren't here!,2020-02-11 18:08:21,Twitter Web App,54,158

Sad that Speaker Pelosi ripped up @POTUS @realDonaldTrump's #SOTU2020 speech which offered a bold policy vision touted our economy honored our nation's heroes &amp; more.  Why do this? Because she won't accept that policies her party has long-derided are making America strong.,2020-02-05 16:00:01,Twitter Web App,560,2795
