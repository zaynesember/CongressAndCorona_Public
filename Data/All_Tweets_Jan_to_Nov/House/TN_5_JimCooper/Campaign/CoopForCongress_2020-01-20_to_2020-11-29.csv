Nashville may be known as Music City but it's also home to brilliant authors and historians like @AuntB. I'm thankful I was able to play a small part in helping her with what is sure to be an illuminating look at three unsolved integration-era bombings. https://t.co/fCQm95NOu1,2020-07-10 18:56:18,Twitter for iPhone,11,54
President Trump's extreme anti-worker agenda is dangerous and must be stopped.

Today’s decision was a major relief. It was also a reminder of the extreme Republican agenda to deny health care to women minorities and the poor. Just one Justice made the difference.   Elections have consequences. The stakes are too high to sit this one out. https://t.co/UiVZjgS335,2020-06-30 00:21:28,Twitter for iPhone,2,4

For years I’ve said over and over that the best thing Tennessee can do for its residents is to expand Medicaid. Instead Republicans and Trump are still trying to repeal the ACA in court which would strip healthcare from 23 million Americans. https://t.co/oWuXEa5iPT,2020-06-27 22:51:42,Twitter for iPhone,2,2
