The Chinese Communist Party's greatest fear is losing its hold on power. It's why they covered up their monumental failure to contain COVID. It's why they don't allow free speech.

Nancy Pelosi and her allies wrote an 1800 page spending bill behind closed doors while she kept members of Congress at home. The bill would cost $3 TRILLION (3000000000000) and yet all Pelosi wants is an up/down vote without any debate. That's not how democracy works. https://t.co/QP7i3fQJuM,2020-05-13 20:58:11,Twitter Web App,2,1
Pelosi just released a $3 TRILLION spending plan she crafted while keeping members home. The GOP and Democrats outside Pelosi's circle had 0 input. It does not get more partisan than that. Not one of the bill's 1800 pages helps our oil/gas industry or brings supply chains home. https://t.co/Xe6VfOwUvl,2020-05-12 18:48:17,Twitter Web App,2,1

We're running a grassroots campaign uniting people from communities across #TX10 behind a positive vision for our nation and our state. Voters have a clear choice in November between results and freedom or partisanship and out-of-touch socialist policies.  https://t.co/vW4goMDUGb,2020-03-05 17:05:18,Twitter Web App,3,6
I am honored by all of the support that I have received from Texans across #TX10.

The contrast on #SuperTuesday is clear. You have freedom and economic prosperity being pushed by Republicans. On the other side you have the party of Bernie Sanders pushing socialism middle class tax hikes and the elimination of private health insurance. https://t.co/RAZk7cYPym,2020-03-03 17:38:41,Twitter Web App,4,15

Fidel Castro was a murderous communist dictator. It's concerning to see House Democrats block this resolution. Senator Sanders won't acknowledge that Castro's "education" programs were propaganda tools to force communist ideology upon the Cuban people.  https://t.co/Wy73azKrBU,2020-02-28 19:03:40,Twitter Web App,3,5

Human trafficking is an EPIDEMIC. There are 300K victims in TX. These citizens should be home w/ loved ones going to school starting careers &amp; chasing dreams.

You have two options:  1⃣ A multi-trillion $$$ Green New Deal that increases government power and puts 300K+ Texas workers out of a job  2⃣ An innovative plan to ⬇️ CO2 emissions that doesn't cost American jobs or cause energy prices to skyrocket  https://t.co/gK5N4sNkuj,2020-02-14 18:46:16,Twitter Web App,1,2
Huawei provides the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) with private/valuable data that neither has a right to. Huawei is a malign arm of the CCP at best and at worst is a tool of the CCP military. The USA must lead the world in #5G! https://t.co/vi8RZvnTdj,2020-02-14 01:08:12,Twitter for iPhone,412,413
The Chinese Communist Party has not played by the rules. For starters it's claimed "developing nation" status to get loans from the World Bank. Does a country with a large space program and the 2nd highest GDP really need loans from the World Bank?  https://t.co/MuS1T1boPp,2020-02-13 23:18:42,Twitter Web App,3,3
Huawei is an extension of the authoritarian Chinese Communist Party (CCP). It seeks to control 5G networks globally and make the CCP the world's data superpower.   I don't trust the CCP with our data. America must win the 5G race!  https://t.co/aARSSB90pU,2020-02-12 20:48:14,Twitter Web App,810,904

It's unacceptable that Speaker Pelosi ripped up the President's SOTU. On those pieces of paper were powerful American stories.

House Democrats played politics with the authorization for military force by totally repealing the bill rather than updating in a bipartisan way. This effort would tie the President's hands with Iran &amp; strip his ability to keep destroying ISIS in Iraq.  https://t.co/BHpWYXIfRb,2020-01-31 16:59:51,Twitter Web App,1,3
