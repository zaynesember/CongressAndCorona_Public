Barr is Trump’s puppet acting as his personal lawyer rather than the people’s atty. He’s undermining our democracy by interfering in the sentencing of Roger Stone &amp; seeking a review of Flynn’s case. Barr claims this is ordinary procedure - he’s an ordinary LIE! He’s got to go!,2020-02-17 02:23:27,Twitter for iPhone,4609,18272
The 4 pro career DOJ attys who investigated Roger Stone recommended 7-9 yrs incarceration b/c Stone is guilty of witness tampering &amp; lying. He is well known as a dirty trickster &amp; political terrorist. This is typical of Trump’s friends. Don’t be surprised if Trump pardons him!,2020-02-17 02:17:14,Twitter for iPhone,385,1401
Gov. Cuomo I know you will not be bullied by con man Don! As a New Yorker you know him better than most and know he tries to bully &amp; intimidate. Please respond and let the world know you will not be blackmailed by this dishonorable President!,2020-02-17 02:15:13,Twitter for iPhone,1443,6286
Many of this crooked President’s supporters are among the most vulnerable beneficiaries of Medicare &amp; Medicaid.

In 2020 our nation's banks are still mostly white &amp; male! As the 1st woman &amp; African American to chair @FSCDems I'm making sure EVERYONE has a seat at the table.

To think that I would attend the #SOTU to hear the message of an IMPEACHED president is a thought that in no way would be consistent w/ my fight and struggle against this dishonorable president. I will certainly NOT be there!,2020-02-04 21:10:01,Twitter for iPhone,15226,113741
America needs to wake up. GOP is willing to lie cheat &amp; steal for power. They have no shame &amp; no guts. They can’t bring themselves to remove a lying criminal con man impeached president in an election year but they can STEAL a Supreme Court seat in an election year! B.S.!,2020-02-01 16:43:41,Twitter for iPhone,6824,21802
I’ve never seen a more insufferable &amp; pathetic group of Senators than those in the GOP. They’ve chosen to strap themselves to a corrupt con man they KNOW is guilty. They’re all cowards. None of them belong in the Senate. They should go home and grow a backbone!,2020-02-01 16:42:14,Twitter for iPhone,17642,76681
Recent attacks on the Jewish community are proof that anti-Semitism is on the rise once again. We must never forget the victims of the Holocaust and continue to confront hate and bigotry. #HolocaustMemorialDay,2020-01-28 01:23:41,Twitter for iPhone,406,1941
I’m absolutely devastated by the death of Kobe &amp; Gianna Bryant. Difficult to believe. My heart goes out to Vanessa Kobe’s children &amp; the families of the victims on the helicopter. Kobe was one of the greatest basketball players of all time. LA will keep his legacy alive forever.,2020-01-27 12:01:08,Twitter for iPhone,420,3768
#MidnightMoscowMitch made it clear that he was not going to be impartial &amp; that he was working w/ Trump on rules. He has organized a sham trial w/ no evidence &amp; witnesses &amp; hopes Americans will sleep thru the trial organized for the accusations to be heard in the dark of night.,2020-01-21 18:49:51,Twitter for iPhone,663,2160
The impeached president has organized his Epstein Team  Starr &amp; Dershowitz along w/ his House henchmen he’s dispatching to lie to the American public to defend him in this sham trial. What a dishonest &amp; disgraceful perversion of our Constitution!,2020-01-21 18:46:49,Twitter for iPhone,2214,8980
What a sad time in American history when Trump &amp; #MoscowMitch can collude to fast-track a SHAM trial when the facts are so clear Trump abused his power. Trump has no defense &amp; never disputed our facts. No wonder polls show most Americans think Trump should be removed from office.,2020-01-21 18:42:35,Twitter for iPhone,1265,4145
If #MidnightMitch &amp; Trump think that all of us are going to be asleep during the trial they have another thought coming because I and others will stay up all night long to hear the democratic team lay out the charges against this criminal enterprise in the White House!,2020-01-21 18:35:56,Twitter for iPhone,1867,6443
Spent the last two days in my district celebrating the life &amp; legacy of Dr. King. Trying to live the life Dr. King would have me to live. Fighting for justice &amp; equality for all people. Not easy but oh so necessary. #MLKDay,2020-01-20 23:35:23,Twitter for iPhone,507,3683
