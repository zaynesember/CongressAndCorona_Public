China should be sanctioned by the U.N. Human Rights Council not serving on it. They detain Uyguhr men women and children in concentration camps and subject them to forced labor and torture.

@hunter_pinke @SenJohnHoeven Devastating. A ban on fracking would stop all new oil and gas development in the state. We produce about 1.2 mil. barrels a day right now. Accounts for 60%+ of our state budget. That number would go down every year significantly w/put new production.,2020-10-23 21:22:08,Twitter for iPhone,3,31
60-70% of North Dakota’s budget comes from oil revenue so what do you suggest for replacing that @JoeBiden? Revenue which keeps schools open and social services running.

Qualified immunity needs serious significant reform. But it cannot be abolished without some replacement policy which protects officers and departments from frivolous litigation which will chase good cops out of service and potentially bankrupt small departments. https://t.co/D3EfjlCgtw,2020-06-17 22:05:30,Twitter Media Studio,5,7
It’s time law enforcement agencies entered the 21st century. Not recording interviews results in failures of justice such as defendants being coerced into false testimony like @GenFlynn. https://t.co/fCcnnOM63z,2020-06-17 21:51:58,Twitter Media Studio,58,125

Anyone opposed to this doesn’t know how law enforcement works. I have seen far too many people taken advantage of by law enforcement who didn’t have to record interviews.  We need to protect defendants and rebuild trust in law enforcement. https://t.co/51kI7MAP0a,2020-06-17 17:32:00,Twitter for iPhone,2,8
Call 302s whatever you want but they’re notes of an interviewing officer’s perspective; subject to bias.  Law enforcement agencies recording interviews from the @FBI to local departments is something we desperately need. https://t.co/PDTOoYVdVV,2020-06-17 17:29:56,Twitter for iPhone,384,1119
This is an issue on which our two chambers can be totally in sync. @SenatorTimScott @senatemajldr and @SenateGOP are leading with action on police reform.   We’ll be working hard to be doing the same in the House. @GOPLeader @Jim_Jordan https://t.co/MYFRVNFXeN,2020-06-17 17:29:50,Twitter for iPhone,159,586
The coming weeks and months tackling police reform are very important.
