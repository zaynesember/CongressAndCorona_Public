That man viciously attacked the Michigan Gov at his fake WH briefing as “That Woman.”  She has a name Donald.  GRETCHEN WHITMER.  Gov. Whitmer is fighting hard for all Michiganders staring down the #coronavirus.  And unlike you she was elected w/o the help of the Russians.,2020-03-28 19:29:34,Twitter for iPhone,1116,3618

There are U.S. citizens throughout the world desperately trying to get back to America.  The Secretary of State is at home playing with puzzles and watching Top Gun?

We’re in the middle of a global pandemic.  The so-called President has repeatedly lied to the American people.  He just spent time attacking the news media during a #Coronavirus press conference.  What a national disgrace.  #RememberInNovember,2020-03-19 17:06:52,Twitter for iPhone,9,25

WOW.  Joe Biden wins decisively in Florida and Illinois.  It appears that Uncle Joe has won every single county in Florida.  That’s almost impossible to do.  Is this race over?  #DemocraticPrimary #2020Primaries,2020-03-18 02:12:29,Twitter for iPhone,3347,17263

The House has passed more than 400 bills to make life better for everyday Americans.  Most remain buried in the Senate legislative graveyard ☠️.  McConnell has apparently cancelled the Senate’s recess next week.  Will anyone notice?,2020-03-13 23:00:57,Twitter for iPhone,5,13
African-Americans in the South are being attacked as low information voters.  Team Gentrification is targeting members of @TheBlackCaucus.  The Obama Presidency is being dismissed as inadequate.

Republican senators ended this trial the same way they began it — taking their cues from White House lawyers and supporting a cover-up. It's clear they never intended to serve as impartial jurors. https://t.co/HcBu9gfWST,2020-02-10 17:17:52,Gain Platform,2,4
