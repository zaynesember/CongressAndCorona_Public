This is the reality on the ground in #Philly.   People need help NOW with housing unemployment &amp; more.   @HouseDemocrats passed the updated #HeroesAct last week to provide it and Trump needs to work with us to reach a deal #ForThePeople! https://t.co/lJa0Ej6abg,2020-10-08 22:12:46,Twitter for iPhone,5,9
2/ If Trump actually cares about drug prices he must tell the GOP Senate to pass the #LowerDrugCosts Now Act (HR 3) that they’ve sat on for TEN MONTHS:   https://t.co/vg6xJrWxbA https://t.co/MSYT2YuA29,2020-10-08 21:05:50,Twitter for iPhone,10,11
1/ Trump is trying to raid the Medicare fund to send what amounts to a campaign mailing costing $19000000 for mailing and $51000000 to produce ONE-TIME cards.   More proof that he cares about himself – not you. https://t.co/hf4hvkM6rq,2020-10-08 21:05:30,Twitter for iPhone,39,36
5/ Whether you back the Eagles or Steelers this weekend whether you prefer Wawa - or Sheetz like @JohnFetterman does - all across PA we need the GOP Senate to step up to save homeowners &amp; renters from homelessness.   Another one-time $1200 check won’t be enough.,2020-10-08 20:22:08,Twitter for iPhone,2,5
4/ The coronavirus crisis has exacerbated the housing crisis.   That’s why I support the updated #HeroesAct @HouseDemocrats passed – it would help struggling families afford a safe place to live with tens of billions in new supports to assist renters and homeowners. https://t.co/fKIwETQyfT,2020-10-08 20:21:38,Twitter for iPhone,2,2

McConnell says he’s “full steam ahead” on rushing through Trump’s Supreme Court nominee despite Trump &amp; a GOP senator testing positive for Covid.

2/ Republicans held a Supreme Court seat open in 2016 for ELEVEN MONTHS before a new nomination – and another 3 months after that for confirmation.   They can -- and must -- wait 4 months until to hear the will of the people this time.,2020-09-19 18:45:26,Twitter Web App,12,28
1/ With the passing of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg America has lost a giant for women’s rights and civil rights generally.    Her last words to us were: “My most fervent wish is that I will not be replaced until a new president is installed.”   The Senate must honor that wish. https://t.co/LPVB4gRyqq,2020-09-19 18:44:50,Twitter Web App,23,39
