Joe Biden's promise to create a government-run socialist health care system would sabotage Americans' progress on lifesaving cures.   Especially as we wage war against a pandemic our nation can’t afford to give up on the promise of America. https://t.co/bkN0JZ2cbX,2020-10-27 14:06:56,Twitter for iPhone,2,1
It’s an awesome day to welcome @realDonaldTrump back to Blair County!!,2020-10-26 13:09:34,Twitter for iPhone,4,9

As @Mike_Pence said Joe Biden would be a cheerleader for China. President @realDonaldTrump and Republicans are standing up to the #CCP and bringing jobs home.  We want jobs in Somerset not Shanghai.  We want jobs in Bedford not Beijing.   We want jobs in Waynesboro not Wuhan.,2020-10-22 18:22:04,Twitter for iPhone,5,7

If Pennsylvanians don’t trust Joe Biden’s approach to energy it’s because we’ve seen it all before.   We can’t afford the radical Biden-Harris agenda that would kill our jobs and repeat Obama’s failed energy record.  https://t.co/rvS8Bu8tC8,2020-10-08 01:56:56,Twitter for iPhone,4,5
Under @realDonaldTrump’s leadership America is energy independent for the first time in my life. Rather than staying reliant on foreign nations today we are a net exporter of American-made energy.  Pennsylvania can’t afford Joe Biden’s energy agenda. https://t.co/rvS8Bu8tC8,2020-09-30 02:32:43,Twitter for iPhone,7,5

Hardworking Pennsylvanians power America. Joe Biden’s radical energy agenda would kill high-paying family-sustaining jobs here in our community. Clearly the Biden-Harris platform won’t work for us.,2020-08-31 18:15:09,Twitter for iPhone,4,5
