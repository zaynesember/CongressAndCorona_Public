When all is said and done I believe Michèle Flournoy will be the right choice to lead the Department of Defense for President-elect Joe Biden.,2020-11-25 23:24:19,Twitter for iPhone,2,43
Lastly it’s hard not to notice that some of the objections raised against Michèle Fluornoy could equally apply to other high-level national security appointments over the years. She should be subject to the highest ethical standards and a transparent vetting process.,2020-11-25 23:24:19,Twitter for iPhone,4,33
Her appointment would be historic. The nat’l security community has long struggled w gender diversity &amp; opportunity issues. Her appt would show women can reach the highest levels in defense policy &amp; break a glass ceiling that has kept talented women from rising through the ranks.,2020-11-25 23:24:19,Twitter for iPhone,2,28
She has the experience to hit the ground running on day one at the Pentagon and restore confidence at home and abroad after years of chaos and mismanagement of our military under Trump.,2020-11-25 23:24:19,Twitter for iPhone,2,27
Michèle Flournoy is an expert on both existing and emerging national security issues. She has worked for years to raise the alarm on a variety of new threats like climate change and pandemic disease.,2020-11-25 23:24:18,Twitter for iPhone,2,29

4. I am relieved that Navajo Nation and others will finally begin to see relief Congress passed a month ago.

3. The $4.8 billion released today is only 60% of the full $8B relief fund and it is being released a week AFTER the 30 day statutory deadline set in the CARES Act. There is still no timeline for the final 40% of the aid to be released.,2020-05-06 00:00:08,Twitter for iPhone,7,14

Did you know that over 1/3 of Americans living on Tribal lands lack access to broadband compared to 8% of all Americans? I introduced the Bridging the Tribal Digital Divide Act which encourages aggressive broadband deployment across Indian Country to end this disparity. https://t.co/8YGkHvXT1B,2020-02-19 17:43:40,Twitter Web Client,7,27

What happened at Hacienda was horrifying &amp; shocking.

The President is directing a lighter sentence for his friend. That’s corruption pure and simple. https://t.co/TQJnAUIs99,2020-02-11 22:34:41,Twitter for iPhone,21,50
Stars &amp; Stripes was a link to home when I was in Iraq and Okinawa. It’s an A+ indie take on everyday DoD news f*** ups and Administration &amp; General Officer BS. No wonder this President wants to cut it. He’s got a fight on his hands. https://t.co/wlx39o74DG,2020-02-11 20:07:47,Twitter for iPhone,26,35

The President’s shame is now the shame of those Senators who acquitted him and we are all poorer for it. I look forward to a time when that shame is washed away by American voters. (5/5),2020-02-07 23:09:04,Twitter for iPhone,9,26
Trump’s lawlessness knows no bounds and the Republican Senators who voted to acquit him of obvious abuses have enabled further illegal presidential actions with their self-serving willful cowardice. (4/),2020-02-07 23:09:03,Twitter for iPhone,6,19
LTC Vindman will find another job &amp; I’m confident he’ll continue to honorably serve our country. He knows like many of us servicemembers that no one can take your honor from you. Only you can give it away. As we’ve seen the President has no honor left to give. (3/),2020-02-07 23:09:03,Twitter for iPhone,5,10
I am disappointed that Trump vindictively and spitefully retaliated against LTC Vindman for doing his duty but I am not surprised. That’s who the President is: a vindictive man imprisoned by his own worst instincts. (2/),2020-02-07 23:09:03,Twitter for iPhone,4,10

As I’ve said before: this plan recklessly strips protections even on lands still included in the Monument after Trump’s illegal reduction.
