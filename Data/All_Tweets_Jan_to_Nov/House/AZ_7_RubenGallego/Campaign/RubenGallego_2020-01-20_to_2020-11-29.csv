It’s not an official public hearing. It is happening at a hotel. The legislature cant pass any laws with out 2/3 vote of the House and Senate. ( Dems have enough votes to block) This is just another Trump grift. https://t.co/FTvvzywGjd,2020-11-28 04:39:46,Twitter for iPhone,138,921
1. You cant call a special session without 2/3 of the Senate and House.  (Not going to happen) 2. The Governor could call a special session. 3. But any change to election law requires 2/3 of legislature in order to take place immediately- not going t happen. https://t.co/5x9mfwWGPh,2020-11-28 00:01:23,Twitter for iPhone,94,601

Helpful tips to the MSM covering Trump’sLatino roundtable 1.More Latinos voted in 2018 than 2016. Stopping Trump is the motivator - Imagine when he is on the ballot 2. Latino vote is young.

Trump’s assault on Latino dignity started on that escalator the first day of his campaign. He can host as many roundtables as he wants in Arizona but he can’t erase four years of divisive anti-Latino anti-immigrant policies.
