To me the single most interesting state politically in the 20 years of this century is Iowa. It is the only state in the country that was won by Gore Bush Obama and Trump.  Further Obama won it by 9.5% in 2008. Trump won it by 9.5% in 2016. A close and highly elastic state.,2020-08-14 22:26:03,Twitter for iPhone,7,42

Jeff Van Drew is a weak man who has no core beliefs. He went from vowing to “never support” Donald Trump to then pledging his “undying loyalty” to Trump only weeks later. We will defeat this coward in November. https://t.co/QBo15kSHcw,2020-01-29 00:58:38,Twitter for iPhone,87,497

(The inner monologue of a GOP Senator)  “Trump obviously did it. The evidence is overwhelming and it’s not even contradicted. But there’s no way I can vote to convict. I will lose in a primary.

Mike Pompeo is the classic “kiss up/kick down” type. He’s a bully to those whom he can bully. Full with fake bravado. But to his boss he’s completely subservient. He is Trump’s weak little poodle. https://t.co/MvNJ3Q5wv9,2020-01-24 22:53:09,Twitter for iPhone,28,92

Completely false. Here are the Philly numbers:  Obama 2012: 492k votes  Hillary 2016: 488k votes   The dropoff was 4K votes. She lost PA by 44k. What cost us victory in PA 2016 was the large number of voters in places like Scranton Erie etc who switched from Obama to Trump. https://t.co/n2WEz49Rx1,2020-01-23 19:11:33,Twitter for iPhone,14,66
Today @realDonaldTrump was in Davos hob knobbing with billionaires congratulating them for the big tax cut he gave them. Then Trump followed that up by promising to put Social Security and Medicare on the chopping block if he wins a 2nd term. We can’t let him do it. #No2ndTerm,2020-01-22 20:24:58,Twitter for iPhone,19,65
