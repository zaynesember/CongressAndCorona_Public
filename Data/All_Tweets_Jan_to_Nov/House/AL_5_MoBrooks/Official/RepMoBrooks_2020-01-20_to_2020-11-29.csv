Did you see where #SpeakerNancyPelosi gave away expensive pens used to sign the #impeachment articles?  Have you seen fundraising ads by Socialist Dems who got the pens?  “FOR SALE. ONE GOLD IMPEACHMENT PEN. Used only once. Didn’t work!”  #Acquitted4Life @realDonaldTrump   Ha! https://t.co/4NT5n0hWqp,2020-02-07 13:58:24,Twitter for iPad,24,68
H.R. 2474 HOUSE VOTE (1) denies Americans their secret ballot vote right on unionizing &amp; (2) forces American workers to pay union dues or be fired.  H.R. 2474 PASSES House 224-194. Sadly Dictatorial Socialism beats American freedom.  Unlike Dems I VOTED WITH the American flag! https://t.co/hwTMpi4UFd,2020-02-07 02:13:06,Twitter for iPad,14,27

Socialist Dems push H.R. 2474 to (1) deny Americans their right to a secret ballot vote on unionizing &amp; (2) force American workers to pay union dues or be fired.  The battle lines are clear: Dictatorial Socialism or American freedom.  Unlike Dems I vote with the American flag! https://t.co/9Hk80ZARhB,2020-02-07 01:05:32,Twitter for iPad,175,384

The House formally disapproved GOP Congressman’s poor remarks during an Obama SOTU.  I support equal treatment.  I just co-sponsored a resolution that formally “disapproves of the behavior of Speaker #Pelosi” for tearing up @realDonaldTrump speech during SOTU.  Disgraceful. https://t.co/nLptIjkhIV,2020-02-05 22:51:08,Twitter for iPad,53,159
#MittRomney “convict @realDonaldTrump” logic is backwards. Romney: Biden acts are “ugly” but “No crime was alleged by the defense”. Requiring 100% proof BEFORE investigating is silly. Investigation purpose: find “acquit or convict” proof. If already have proof why investigate? https://t.co/WEhFGyoSxK,2020-02-05 20:11:59,Twitter for iPad,18,46
I applaud President Trump’s @DHSgov for putting America first by restricting travel from 6 more countries that have inadequate &amp; unreliable citizen information which diminishes our security agencies' ability to assess terrorism risk posed. https://t.co/892G4D7uOF,2020-02-05 19:05:36,Twitter Web App,7,38

.@realDonaldTrump SOTU was GREAT MAGNIFICENT...a political combination of Super Bowl Iron Bowl March Madness...with a pinch of Roman Coliseum as flavoring.

Socialist Dems offer new $760 billion #infrastructure bill for America. That’s good!  What’s bad is Dems offer no way to pay for it.  Worse yet Dems CUT road and highway funding (what USA needs most) to 67% of total spending 9 points less than Obama Administration’s 76%!

Aaron: Per FAIR MINIMUM estimate for illegal alien "higher tax cost" is about $300/year/man woman or child in America.  Your cost share = household members (x) $300/year.
