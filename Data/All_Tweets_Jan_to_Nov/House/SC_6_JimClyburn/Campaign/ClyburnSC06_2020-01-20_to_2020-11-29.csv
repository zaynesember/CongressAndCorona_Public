Congratulations to my good friend and a very good man.  President @JoeBiden will restore honor and hope in America as he leads us out of trying times.  There are challenges and hard work ahead but today we celebrate this important step toward a more perfect Union. https://t.co/1QwMCIpgqn,2020-11-07 16:53:41,Twitter for iPhone,241,1154
I am both humbled and honored to continue to serve the people of South Carolina’s 6th district.  As your Congressman I will continue to put service above self and principles above politics.   Thank you for your ongoing support.,2020-11-04 04:11:16,Twitter for iPhone,61,338
Polls close at 7PM in South Carolina. STAY IN LINE!   If you are in line at closing time you have a legal right to vote.  Don’t give up...cast your ballot no matter how long it takes!,2020-11-03 22:57:55,Twitter for iPhone,40,132
I am incredibly proud of @harrisonjaime. No matter the outcome tonight he is already a winner.  I have known Jaime since he was in 11th grade. He continues to amaze me with his authenticity and exceptional record of standing up for civil &amp; human rights. https://t.co/RRak7mLdp4,2020-11-03 21:46:37,Twitter for iPhone,446,3291
I will always be an Omega but today I stand with @KamalaHarris and @akasorority1908. https://t.co/ACw3lqPVou,2020-11-03 20:10:09,Twitter for iPhone,122,998
This may be the most consequential election of your lifetime.   Empathy is on the ballot.   Healthcare is on the ballot.   Civil &amp; human rights are on the ballot.   VOTE.,2020-11-03 13:17:23,Twitter for iPhone,98,285
Good to join @harrisonjaime and @joecunninghamsc today in Charleston County. It is the final GOTV push. All in. Vote. https://t.co/E0WY46RJHw,2020-11-02 00:54:30,Twitter for iPhone,55,259
"I don't need to tell you who to vote for...you know who to vote for I'm just asking you to vote."  Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s words are just as relevant now as they were 56 years ago.  Election day is almost upon us.  You know who you ought to vote for.  Vote. https://t.co/KZGissLWgh,2020-10-28 16:10:43,Twitter Media Studio,968,2981
I am thankful for @ChasCityPaper's endorsement and I will continue my efforts to “deliver for South Carolina and guide national policy with 6th District residents in mind.” https://t.co/2mKThQ6dgX,2020-10-25 19:08:42,Twitter for iPhone,33,81
A record number of South Carolinians requested mail-in ballots this year.   If you received one NOW is the time to return it.  If you changed your mind and want to vote in person return the unused ballot at the polling place.   Make sure your vote counts!,2020-10-23 16:55:49,Twitter for iPhone,50,138
I am humbled to receive @thestate newspaper's endorsement. If re-elected I will continue my commitment to "move beyond partisanship to constructively tackle the issues that affect average South Carolinians."  https://t.co/VFvHv1gxbF,2020-10-23 16:07:22,Twitter for iPhone,27,68
This is the most consequential election of my lifetime which is why I’m leaving nothing to chance. On the first day of absentee voting in South Carolina I cast my ballot for @JoeBiden for President and @harrisonjaime for U.S. Senate. Vote early and vote in person if you‘re able. https://t.co/sniyqZBh3K,2020-10-08 18:19:28,Twitter for iPhone,553,1683
A new generation of political leaders is coming of age.   @MoeBrownSC is a talented young leader with the ability to bring people together and get the job done.   I'm proud to support him in his bid for Congress.,2020-08-25 19:22:51,Twitter for iPhone,44,146
On Monday I stood across from Emanuel AME Church down the road from Gadsden's Wharf &amp; talked about Democrats' vision for this country as did many others this week. It's important that we create a climate where we can find common ground instead of being at each other's throats. https://t.co/BHMc4La3or,2020-08-23 01:24:36,Twitter Media Studio,19,60
When it comes to just being a good person guided by faith rooted in the Constitution of these United States of America wanting for others as much as he would have for himself — you can't get a better person than @JoeBiden .   #DemConvention @DeadlineWH @MSNBC https://t.co/bw2ngPgWWl,2020-08-21 00:16:28,Twitter Media Studio,37,92
@dccc @CheriBustos @tedlieu Let's dedicate this election year to John Lewis.   Let's declare October election month in preparation for November 3rd election day.   Request your absentee ballot now and encourage your friends and family to do the same.   Vote early. We must make sure our voices are heard.,2020-08-20 18:55:04,Twitter Web App,52,97
@dccc @CheriBustos @tedlieu I'm making sure that all Americans have unfettered access to the ballot.   House Democrats passed the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act and I have introduced legislation with Kamala Harris the #VoteSafe Act to address COVID-related voting challenges.,2020-08-20 18:47:15,Twitter Web App,32,41
@dccc @CheriBustos @tedlieu We are the most diverse Democratic Caucus in history and each of us brings our own lived experiences to this august body.   I am proud to work alongside so many individuals whose experiences have shaped their values and perspectives as they do the work of the American people.,2020-08-20 18:38:37,Twitter Web App,22,34
@dccc @CheriBustos @tedlieu We aren’t going to have football as usual this year but we are going to organize absentee voting in tailgating fashion.   We’re organizing all over South Carolina and I’m calling on all Democrats to declare October election month in preparation for November 3rd election day.,2020-08-20 18:30:47,Twitter Web App,29,94
@dccc @CheriBustos @tedlieu Unemployment access to affordable internet &amp; health care are some of the issues impacting my constituents.   Over 500k South Carolinians lack access to reliable internet.   As we move to online work/school we must ensure that increased broadband will be part of our recovery.,2020-08-20 18:23:04,Twitter Web App,19,30
@dccc @CheriBustos @tedlieu House Democrats have already:  ☑️ Passed legislation to protect the Obama/Biden ACA law   ☑️ Enhanced Medicaid coverage for low-income &amp; unemployed Americans   ☑️ Increased funding for hospitals &amp; healthcare programs   ☑️ Ensured access to much-needed telehealth services,2020-08-20 18:14:29,Twitter Web App,31,49
Donald Trump has given us all that we need to vote against but I believe that after both conventions are over we will see the American people moving towards the policies Joe Biden has put forth rather than voting just to remove the current President from office. https://t.co/1uuBJEywdi,2020-08-19 13:24:40,Twitter Web App,20,45
We need a President who sees unifying people as a requirement of the job. That’s why I stand with Joe and why he will always be an adopted son of South Carolina. @JoeBiden is as good a man as he is a leader. We know Joe. But more importantly Joe knows us. https://t.co/1NI8Kh7kko,2020-08-18 20:00:25,Twitter for iPhone,129,296
I think we are at a great place in this country.  All Kamala’s got to do is keep on being herself execute this well and she will be the next vice president of the United States. https://t.co/7xQi2sbhwY,2020-08-12 16:42:04,Twitter for iPhone,44,117
I am very pleased with @JoeBiden’s decision to choose @KamalaHarris as his VP.  Those of us who have been battling for years now trying to move this country forward toward a more perfect union are very pleased.   I think all women in this nation can be proud of this moment.,2020-08-11 22:08:57,Twitter for iPhone,76,285
This decision to provide prepaid postage to South Carolina absentee voters eliminates a poll tax that would have discouraged voting and forced more people to risk their health by voting in person during this unprecedented pandemic. https://t.co/vGPIq0ETQD,2020-07-09 21:19:13,Twitter for iPhone,68,147
We need leaders in Congress with proven records of standing up for civil &amp; human rights.  @RepEliotEngel is not new to the fight for justice &amp; equality - he’s been in the fight for his entire life &amp; I’ve worked w/ him on these issues for almost 3 decades. https://t.co/NLSkkZX1pl,2020-06-15 13:38:03,Twitter for iPhone,43,90
I filed today to run for re-election in SC-06 to continue my work to make America's greatness accessible and affordable for all.   I hope you will join me in this effort. https://t.co/xskEYM0A97,2020-03-16 16:47:52,Twitter for iPhone,153,850
Although he was my preferred choice from the beginning Joe is not a perfect candidate nor has he led a perfect campaign.   And yet I know that he is the best Democrat for the job.  https://t.co/xUpioqO6B7,2020-03-12 18:48:51,Twitter for iPhone,50,241
I know Joe and Joe knows us.  I believe that he is the best candidate to help move this country forward and that’s why I am encouraging everyone voting this #SuperTuesday to vote for @JoeBiden. https://t.co/0woHxrKdx9,2020-03-03 18:40:23,Twitter for iPhone,543,2145
South Carolina chose well today @JoeBiden. https://t.co/aLERV1MUr2,2020-03-01 04:36:54,Twitter for iPhone,1235,7500
It’s Democratic Primary Day in South Carolina. I strongly encourage all South Carolinians to get out and vote today and let me know who you voted for in the comments below ⬇️ #Democrats2020 https://t.co/E9VaAbyHBD,2020-02-29 16:04:34,Twitter for iPhone,51,237
I have gone with @JoeBiden because he has the background the experience and the record.   Here in South Carolina we believe the best way to tell what a person will do is to look at what he or she has done. https://t.co/OTyztTRJrY,2020-02-28 19:23:40,Twitter for iPhone,823,2779
I know Joe we know Joe but most importantly Joe knows us.   I can think of no one with the integrity no one more committed to the fundamental principles to make this country what it is than my good friend my late wife's great friend Joe Biden. https://t.co/wGap4YU1g9,2020-02-26 21:33:14,Twitter Media Studio,618,1845
My wife &amp; I often talked about what our parents sacrificed for us &amp; what we owed to our children &amp; other children similarly situated. We often talked about the leadership of this country &amp; there's nobody who Emily loved as a leader in this country more than she loved @JoeBiden. https://t.co/PbJ9soTcvd,2020-02-26 21:30:14,Twitter Media Studio,162,422
I know Joe Biden.   I know his character his heart and his record.   Joe Biden has stood for the hard-working people of South Carolina.   We know Joe. But more importantly he knows us.   In South Carolina we choose presidents.   I’m calling on you to stand with @JoeBiden.,2020-02-26 14:29:26,Twitter for iPhone,10978,38842
