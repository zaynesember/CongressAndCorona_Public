John was both a minister &amp; a living example who demonstrated what it means to follow the moral compass directed by one’s faith.

I think it's time for us to pass a voting rights act and name it the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act of 2020.

This latest #SOTU lie reinforces what has long been clear: in too many instances Opportunity Zones are just another tax credit for wealthy investors.   We must enact the Opportunity Zone Reform Act to ensure OZs actually benefit communities in need. https://t.co/N9kEftfMlT,2020-02-14 02:19:28,Twitter for iPhone,91,193

Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the U.S. or any State on account of sex.  It's simple.

At his #SOTU address the President said he would always protect social security and medicare.  Less than a week later he released his budget proposal which would cut nearly $500 Billion from social and safety net programs. #TrumpBudget https://t.co/43xN3gL7kA,2020-02-12 20:29:03,Twitter Media Studio,139,161

So often when we pause to pay homage to Black Americans during #BlackHistoryMonth we tend to focus on those whose names made the headlines.

This President has lied to the American people over &amp; over again &amp; his latest budget proposal proves it.  Under his proposed budget Americans would see cuts to Medicare Medicaid Social Security &amp; SNAP.

New study finds that low-income workers should thank state minimum wage increases not Trump for their wage gains.   To lift wages nationwide the Senate must pass the Raise the Wage Act—and the President must sign it. https://t.co/HiuZs5GNxX,2020-02-07 19:02:59,Twitter Web App,80,158

Our country is riding the wave of the Obama economy which lowered unemployment from 10% to 4.7%. Trump tried to take credit for several Obama accomplishments during last night’s #SOTU.

Tonight’s #SOTU address demonstrated that our President is out of touch and out of time.    America is not experiencing a ‘great comeback.’   America has always been great.
