Political opponents don’t have to be enemies.   Last night my opponent Uriah Luallin &amp; I got together. We talked politics travel congress &amp; family. No one yelled &amp; no food fight broke out.   It was just two people who love their country having a conversation. https://t.co/WtHs4mDoPz,2020-10-09 13:15:13,Twitter for iPhone,16,291

I just finished “Calvin Coolidge in the Black Hills.” It is a throughly fun read in part because of the President’s unique demeanor but also because of @SethTupper’s writing. Great stories about Gov Bulow car ride trout fishing student preacher Haley affair. Recommend. https://t.co/J1FuLtj0U2,2020-06-06 18:05:34,Twitter for iPhone,11,51

@JillCallison @Argus_Joe Jill I spoke hyperbolically as he alluded to in his blog post &amp; later stated explicitly. You‘ve never given me benefit of doubt but do you see why concerns re: availability of poll workers &amp; the need to sanitize regularly might have caused me to encourage people to vote early?,2020-06-02 21:13:24,Twitter for iPhone,0,1

Day 2 - Dusty saw the crisis at the border firsthand - that's why he supported billions for the border wall &amp; border security during his first year in office.  @realDonaldTrump wants to see 400 miles of wall done by the end of 2020 - RT if you support!   https://t.co/8NLwdSTQDa,2020-03-04 03:34:32,Twitter for iPhone,6,3
