American military and economic dominance is no longer guaranteed and this will have a profound effect on our nation’s approach to foreign policy. Happy to see @UTSA and @CFR_org are hosting a constructive discussion on how to address the global challenges we face. #CFRatUTSA https://t.co/aSt8Jole5t,2020-02-11 16:13:25,Twitter Web App,6,32
China’s scheme to overtake the U.S. economy started years ago and today’s announcement confirms what we suspected — the Equifax breach was state sponsored. Our government and the private sector must collaborate to stop these entirely preventable breaches. https://t.co/AUbPsLIxXn,2020-02-10 21:52:59,TweetDeck,1116,1271

Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the U.S. and claims hundreds of thousands of lives each year.

Poverty lack of economic opportunity and violence in the Northern Triangle are root causes of the humanitarian crisis on our border. I look forward to continuing to work with Ambassador @Martha_Barcena and other regional partners to address these shared issues. https://t.co/3PU4Z6ZOKu,2020-02-07 19:30:00,Twitter Media Studio,3,17
You can't make this up. General Secretary Xi's communist regime detained and silenced Dr. Wenliang for speaking out on the dangers of coronavirus and now the virus has taken his life.   Their refusal to be fully transparent has put the world at risk. https://t.co/a6UOjmdkfU,2020-02-07 17:37:38,Twitter for iPhone,43,160
Private and public sector collaboration is vital for America to lead in advanced technologies like 5G and out-innovate China as they seek to surpass us as the world’s top economy by 2049. https://t.co/4PvhNlxiqu,2020-02-05 22:14:32,TweetDeck,8,19
The National Mall is our country's front yard and has museums for miles telling our nation's stories. But there's one set of stories that's missing: the stories of the largest ethnic minority in the U.S.  Proud to testify today on why we need a #LatinoMuseumNow. @LatinoMuseum https://t.co/VJ8Fr2LoXx,2020-02-05 20:30:00,Twitter Media Studio,9,82
The local cyber proving ground has put #SanAntonio on the map as Cyber City USA. I look forward to watching Alamo City and the nation continue to lead on 5G and advanced technologies. Our way of life as we know it depends on it. https://t.co/LtEeIdFYVG,2020-02-05 18:06:37,TweetDeck,4,28

Home to 250k veterans and 80k active duty soldiers #SanAntonio is Military City USA.

Good piece on what China will do to surpass the United States as the most important economy. We need new policies to confront this threat like if an American company can’t do something in China then Chinese companies shouldn’t be able to do it here. https://t.co/P1lOvlciXE,2020-02-02 16:21:48,Twitter for iPhone,674,747
We’ve heard of protests in Hong Kong and Iran but there have been protests in Georgia. These are freedom-loving people fighting Russian oppression and demanding that their gov't implement promised democratic reforms.

The Kurdish Regional Government is our steadfast ally in a turbulent region. This makes them a target of the Iranian regime which is why we should protect them our troops and the millions of internationally displaced people @KRG_USA and her government provide aid for. https://t.co/bT4VzbS9xd,2020-01-29 22:00:00,Twitter Media Studio,6,51

The challenge we face is not whether next generation technology will be transformative or disruptive but how we will manage the coming disruption.  We must take advantage of technology before it takes advantage of us. #SOTN2020,2020-01-28 14:24:50,Twitter for iPhone,8,54

The Holocaust showed the depth of the human capacity for evil.   As we observe #HolocaustRemembranceDay today 75 years after the liberation of Auschwitz we must continue to stand tall against hate and show that only light can conquer darkness. #WeRemember https://t.co/Pft9wZIq6Y,2020-01-27 13:42:39,Twitter Web App,29,121
