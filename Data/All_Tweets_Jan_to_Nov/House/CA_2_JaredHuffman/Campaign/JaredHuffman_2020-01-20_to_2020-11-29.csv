Amazing Americans from every field of endeavor have received the Presidential Medal of Freedom.  Rush Limbaugh doesn't belong on this list.  Trump took us to another new low &amp; cheapened this Medal for all those who actually deserved to receive it. https://t.co/IpvJO03W4o,2020-02-05 18:38:34,Twitter Web App,3,22
@JonathanTurley How about turning SOTU into a grotesque medal ceremony for Rush Limbaugh of all people?,2020-02-05 14:17:58,Twitter for Android,6,33
This was deeply disgusting. https://t.co/bexgrH77uG,2020-02-05 04:15:55,Twitter for Android,10,70
Instead of State of the Union Trump gave a hyperpartisan State of the Electoral College speech tonight. Worst SOTU ever from worst POTUS ever.  P.S.  I'm very sorry Rush Limbaugh has cancer but seriously?,2020-02-05 04:00:39,Twitter for Android,9,58

The day is coming when all of the stonewalling and desperate hiding of facts will give way to truth -- on Ukraine tax returns and more.  Those who cast their lot with this con man will be made to regret it. https://t.co/qKXkOmSwJz,2020-02-01 21:05:23,Twitter Web App,16,70
My latest podcast - with the Chair of the Select Committee on the Climate Crisis Rep. Kathy Castor (D-FL).  Great conversation on the climate crisis.  More great episodes on the way!  https://t.co/AUc59uv0Ws,2020-02-01 18:34:28,Twitter Web App,3,2

Glad I'm not the only one who has accidentally invoked "Michael Bolton" when talking about witnesses in the Senate trial.  I do want to see witnesses but we should all agree that calling pop singer Michael Bolton would be a bridge too far.  https://t.co/wPUCRxxe9j,2020-01-29 21:21:12,Twitter Web App,4,9

This week we'll vote to reinstate Congress' vital role in authorizing wars by repealing the outdated authorization of military force.  Should Congress be consulted before a president attacks a foreign power and puts American lives in danger?

Great town hall in Petaluma today.  Highlight:  95-year old WWII Vet after speaking eloquently asked me to announce he needed a ride to the bus stop.

Do the math - our President spends most of his time watching Faux News &amp; rage tweeting even when he's at an international conference in Davos.

Coincidences piling up. The only bank stupid enough to lend billions to Trump in 2013 is Russia's favorite bank which happens get $500M from Gazprom at same time as the Trump loan and happens to have history of laundering Russian $$.
