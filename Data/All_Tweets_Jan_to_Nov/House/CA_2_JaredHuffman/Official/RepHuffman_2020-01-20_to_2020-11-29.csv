With millions of #COVID19 cases nationwide we have ALL been personally victimized by those who refuse to wear a mask. Mask up &amp; stop the spread of this pandemic. #OnWednesdaysWeWearPink #WearAMask https://t.co/v6FVQ6KhHk,2020-07-22 18:10:40,Twitter for iPhone,5,31
Confederate statues represent a particular moment in our nation’s history. What we do with them *today* is what defines who we are now and what we want our country to stand for. I asked today’s @NRdems panel about the importance of removing these symbols from #PublicLands. https://t.co/eI27FkomgA,2020-07-21 23:31:35,Twitter Media Studio,8,24

Earlier this year my public lands bill for NW CA passed out of the House with bipartisan support—but @senatemajldr still hasn’t acted. Adding it to the #NDAA gives the Senate another chance to take up this locally-driven bill for the people and landscapes of #CA02. https://t.co/m9ug2n1zBN,2020-07-21 00:16:43,Twitter Media Studio,12,37
I have worked for years to prevent federal resources from being used to glorify the hate and treason that confederate names and symbols represent.

I’m honored to have my constituent &amp; veteran—Ernie Bergman—by my side at tonight’s #SOTU. A thoughtful counterpoint to Trump’s careless military actions Ernie has lived through the pain &amp; consequences of war and turned that into a lifetime of advocating to end further violence. https://t.co/cMChyM6ZyR,2020-02-05 00:50:36,Twitter for iPhone,3,28
Gun violence is an epidemic in our country and something no one should have to experience in places of worship work or education. Last year the House passed the Bipartisan Background Checks Act to help #EndGunViolence. It's time for the Senate to do the same. #NotOneMore,2020-02-04 15:26:54,Twitter Web App,16,38

More information continues to come out about the President’s corrupt acts. By voting to block witness testimony #GOPSenators proved they’d rather “hear no evil see no evil” than get the truth. They have failed to deliver a fair trial. https://t.co/A46wz7XDdM,2020-02-04 01:04:03,Twitter for iPhone,7,26

President Trump is permanently damaging our democracy. Senators: cast your vote to #DefendOurDemocracy from foreign interference and #EndTheCoverUp.   Every member of the @SenateGOP who casts a vote to support Trump's cover-up is ignoring their duty to the Constitution.,2020-01-31 18:34:33,Twitter Web App,22,66
Bottom line: Congress has a solemn duty to keep the American people safe. Yesterday I voted to reclaim Congress’s sole power to declare war – and rein in this reckless President whose impulsive actions in the Middle East have brought us to the brink of war. #StopEndlessWar,2020-01-31 14:57:14,Twitter Web App,7,45

I don't know what's worse the dangerous arguments of the President's lawyers or that GOP Senators are buying it. The American people deserve the truth not deception and denial. President Trump has put his selfish interests above all else. https://t.co/iu2gqC6Mnn,2020-01-31 02:22:30,Twitter for iPhone,23,92
President Trump's lawyers confirmed what we already knew: Trump thinks his personal needs are more important than the rights of the American people. Senate must #DefendOurDemocracy and make clear NO President can cheat the American people of a free election. https://t.co/MsUV4jEAOu,2020-01-31 00:27:01,Twitter for iPhone,20,56

The President has repeatedly blocked Congress &amp; the American people from hearing Bolton's testimony--&amp; it’s clear why. @AmbJohnBolton is willing to testify under oath.

We're facing possibly the most corrupt president in our history. He has committed crimes for personal gain—that’s not in question.
