That his attempts to usurp the powers of the presidency and prevent democratically elected leaders from taking office will fail does not excuse Donald Trump's naked authoritarianism or the silence of those who enabled him. https://t.co/k7DUdn1gKW,2020-11-27 20:11:00,TweetDeck,37,202

But once it became clear Trump lost the election a new goal came into view: sabotaging President-elect Biden.

The White House ordered every agency to reclassify some of its workforce as Schedule F by January 19 2021 the day before the Inauguration.

A big deal: the entire United States military will be required to participate in Trump’s payroll tax scheme.  Military families’ payroll taxes will be deferred and then effectively doubled in January and their paychecks will be set to fall by over 10% in 2021.  Trump did this. https://t.co/OFjvO1KkUY,2020-09-04 23:00:30,Twitter for iPhone,3772,4687

Again: Trump's payroll tax order *could* cause much of the U.S. military to see large reductions in their paychecks in January.  Service members would be in line for reduced take-home pay next year if the Administration defers their payroll taxes; we don't know yet if they will. https://t.co/31gNyvy7fr,2020-09-04 19:57:49,Twitter Web App,19,29

As we have warned for weeks the Senate needed to pass an extension a week ago to avoid a lapse in the expanded $600-per-week unemployment benefits.  Mitch McConnell's failure to act already sealed this lapse and half measures and gimmicks from the White House cannot undo it. https://t.co/sGfBY4XoGV,2020-07-30 20:57:56,Twitter Web App,36,68

Mitch McConnell's response to his own constituent who needs the $600 weekly enhanced unemployment benefit  - that he refuses to extend - to pay for her medicine is to tout a *one-time* $1200 payment.
