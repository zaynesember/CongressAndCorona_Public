Where was the outrage when this impeachment process began and Democrats would not allow Republicans to call witnesses? The commentators were silent then. Nothing to see here move along. But now a lack of witnesses is a “perfidy”?,2020-02-02 15:38:12,Twitter for iPhone,13,43

What also stands out about this growth is that it's being seen across the country.  In the past even when the economy was good states like Alabama were sometimes left behind.

This new trade deal is long overdue.
