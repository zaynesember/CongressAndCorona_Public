NY recently pursued reforms to save $ in Medicaid.  The 2nd coronavirus bill that passed Congress had a technical error where if NY enacts reforms saving even just $1 in Medicaid it loses $6 BIL.

FACT: These were the only 3 witnesses requested by the GOP AND the Dems. They were ALL previously called only by Schiff during the closed door depos.,2020-01-25 03:12:52,Twitter Web App,1278,3246
Schiff Claim #1: He blocked GOP questions of witnesses in the House bc we were asking "Who is the whistleblower because we want to punish him?"   FACT: If you read through all of the transcripts you will not find that question asked once.,2020-01-25 03:12:52,Twitter Web App,1721,4060
I was on the Senate floor this evening for the #SchiffShow road show &amp; it was hard to keep up with all of the spin misleading &amp; outright lies.   Is the media ready to fact check Schiff on any of this or is his nonsense just the media's new Talking Points to blindly adopt?,2020-01-25 03:12:51,Twitter Web App,5393,13285
Burisma is a corrupt Ukraine gas co. run by a corrupt Ukraine oligarch.  They were being investigated for corruption...again.  They hired Hunter Biden for 50k+ p/month w/o energy/Ukraine experience bc he was VP Biden’s son.  If that’s not illegal then it should be https://t.co/sIipXAexVB,2020-01-24 21:28:16,Twitter Media Studio,2813,6503
If you took away Schiff’s ability to use presumption hearsay and lies on this impeachment parody he would be left with nothing. https://t.co/8KQw1M1Iko,2020-01-24 20:34:32,Twitter Media Studio,5206,14352
The Dem House Impeachment Managers continue to ignore a ton of inconvenient truths in their never ending presentation. Another example: https://t.co/ASTfAAWErd,2020-01-24 19:53:16,Twitter Media Studio,655,1628
There it is again folks and of course with zero push back from cheerleader @JohnBerman.   @SenatorTester goes all in during opening arguments with the outrageous position that the President is guilty unless he proves his innocence. https://t.co/Gmj2YWIG4G,2020-01-24 16:44:21,Twitter Media Studio,511,1014
The evidence that House Dems alleged they were delivering at the end of their rushed impeachment inquiry they declared was "overwhelming" "uncontested" "indisputable" &amp; proof "beyond a doubt". Cry me a river with their meltdown now over having so many holes in their boat. https://t.co/yUHeRqOa5y,2020-01-24 14:37:38,Twitter Media Studio,937,2422
Ukrainians interfered during the 2016 US election &amp; if the Burisma/Biden dirty $$$ scheme wasn’t illegal than it should be.   It’s in the best interest of the United States for our countries to work together to get to the bottom of both. https://t.co/dCKEEUA6cR,2020-01-24 13:01:25,Twitter Media Studio,1658,4013
Pres Obama refused to provide lethal aid to Ukraine. His team didn't want to upset Putin.  Pres Trump provided lethal aid to Ukraine regardless of whether or not it would upset Putin.,2020-01-24 02:43:56,Twitter Web App,11533,35426

Adam Schiff kicks off Day 3 of the Senate impeachment trial threatening Senators with imprisonment. Not sure what he’s worse at: reading his audience or telling jokes. Either way he is not helping his cause. https://t.co/vLEixsoVTt,2020-01-23 18:44:24,Twitter Media Studio,2138,5291
US law REQUIRES the Pres to withhold aid if Ukraine isn't advancing anti-corruption efforts at that time. It's indisputable Ukrainians interfered in '16 &amp; there was legitimate concern over the Burisma/Biden dirty $$$ scheme. US-Ukraine should be working together on both issues. https://t.co/X009ULSkIj,2020-01-23 04:31:09,Twitter Media Studio,3354,7911
Adam Schiff is trying to write the world’s greatest parody connecting dots not actually connected relying on really bad presumptions lies and hearsay. He’s putting America to sleep with his uninspiring fairy tale on the floor of the US Senate https://t.co/Qj0Ga2HIsP,2020-01-23 02:05:34,Twitter Media Studio,1124,2864
Morrison told Taylor that Sondland told Morrison that Sondland overheard that Zelensky told Pence...This impeachment argument is a house of cards.  By the way strong odds Schiff conveniently forgets to mention Yermak’s public account of that day contradicting Sondland.,2020-01-23 01:38:53,Twitter for iPhone,1271,3126
The burden is on the government to prove that the President committed an impeachable offense. The burden is not on the President to prove his innocence especially when no crime was even alleged.,2020-01-23 00:38:30,Twitter for iPhone,1388,3760

Schiff and his crew can say “no one is above the law” 1000 more times until they are blue in the face but they aren’t accusing the President of breaking a law in their articles of impeachment.,2020-01-22 23:20:45,Twitter for iPhone,2872,8320
Worse than the fact House Democrats are unable to prove an impeachable offense is that they failed to even allege an impeachable offense in their articles of impeachment. https://t.co/tTrGsVrwGP,2020-01-22 22:52:05,Twitter Media Studio,491,1074
If Crow wanted to talk about the answer OMB’s Mark Sandy received as to why there was a hold on aid to Ukraine how does he not disclose that Mark Sandy DID get an answer and it was that the President was concerned about other countries paying their fair share? So dishonest!,2020-01-22 22:31:19,Twitter for iPhone,187,590
Crow just said Pres Zelensky knew there was a hold on aid at the end of July bc Crow read it in NY Times. He forgot the pesky fact that both of the witnesses under oath in the House directly in touch w/Zelensky Ambs Volker &amp; Taylor confirmed Zelensky didn’t know until 8/29.,2020-01-22 22:31:18,Twitter for iPhone,604,1437
If Jason Crow wants to talk about how important it is to provide aid to Ukraine to fight Russia surely he is about to point out that it was President Trump who provided lethal aid to Ukraine that President Obama refused to provide right?,2020-01-22 21:47:38,Twitter for iPhone,703,1763
With their final words on the House floor House Dems declared they proved their impeachment case “beyond a doubt”.   Yesterday they started the impeachment trial declaring they still needed a ton of facts in order to prove their case.   Which is it?   Can’t have it both ways!,2020-01-22 21:30:39,Twitter for iPhone,4715,13069
Burisma is a corrupt Ukrainian gas co. run by a corrupt Ukrainian oligarch that hired Hunter Biden for at least 50k p/month w/no Ukraine or energy experience solely bc he was VP Biden’s son.

The Dems just wasted an entire day in the Senate throwing a fit over missing all sorts of info they would still need to dig up in order to proceed. They are a day late &amp; MANY facts short of the air tight case they insisted they had when passing their sham impeachment articles.,2020-01-22 04:26:10,Twitter for iPhone,2876,8467
Adam Schiff is the last person who should be lecturing the Senate &amp; American public on process after the corrupt rigged sideshow he just jammed through the House.  @RepMarkMeadows &amp; I weighed in this afternoon after we stepped off the Senate floor. https://t.co/zo0TiL8oTu,2020-01-22 00:50:50,Twitter for iPhone,2554,7310
I challenge the media to Fact Check Adam Schiff for their viewers/readers. If anything is stated as fact but the witness only called it a “guess” or it was IDed as hearsay or other witnesses totally contradicted it then say so. If critical facts are missing point it out!,2020-01-21 18:57:28,Twitter for iPhone,2044,5518
This reply states on Page 4:  “President Trump was offered an eminently fair process by the House.” 🤯  It’s amazing that Congressional Democrats are so wildly oblivious to just how much smarter the American public is than these Dems give them credit for. https://t.co/zVpNiNNJKL,2020-01-21 18:22:44,Twitter for iPhone,353,850
House Dems corruptly rigged ENTIRETY of their impeachment inquiry:  -Blocked ALL GOP witnesses not also on Dem list  -Blocked POTUS’ counsel from ALL closed door depos &amp; public Intel hearings  -Cherry picked leaks withheld key facts &amp; outright lied during/after depos #SchiffShow,2020-01-21 17:58:59,Twitter for iPhone,4967,10904
This is absurd on its face. There is no bigger “material fact witness” especially with regards to the Obstruction of Congress charge than lead House Impeachment Manager Adam Schiff. There are substantially more questions he needs to answer than to ask. https://t.co/Di0kZP9Yth,2020-01-21 16:56:15,Twitter for iPhone,1233,2637

The House of Representatives (and quite possibly the @TheJusticeDept as well) should immediately open an investigation to determine: (1) how/why did this happen? (2) who are all of the individuals responsible? and (3) are there any other warehouses like this with unused items? https://t.co/EbhVWQGdwd,2020-01-20 23:32:43,Twitter Web App,1493,3310
