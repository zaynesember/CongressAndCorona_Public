When you lost De Blasio on the claim that NY's cashless bail works then hopefully Albany Dems will finally make drastic changes. A full repeal is in order! It's been less than two months &amp; we've seen a clear spike in crime. Albany needs to fix this ASAP! https://t.co/xo1oY2psdc,2020-02-11 18:40:35,Twitter for iPhone,48,86
House Dems think not proposing a budget at all for 2020 is an option. Yet another reason why they don't belong in the majority. They were so busy using their gavels on impeachment that they didn't even leave themselves enough energy to draft a budget. https://t.co/GDHUnaXSt2,2020-02-10 23:51:59,Twitter for iPhone,276,764
Proud to have fought to acquit @realdonaldtrump. Never should’ve been impeached in the 1st place. Just a corrupt rushed rigged hit job. Dem scheming to destroy POTUS won’t succeed.

New Albany laws have been a nightmare for NY. This heartbreaking case is the latest tragic result. W/o this law this man's identity wouldn't have been compromised before trial.

ACQUITTAL! Finally we have seen the end of the most partisan baseless &amp; rigged impeachment in the history of our country.

Let’s finally move FORWARD as a nation,2020-02-05 21:54:59,Twitter for iPhone,38,214
Moments like this highlight why Pelosi needs to relinquish her Speakership. She’s been poisoned and broken from the inside out and is now poisoning and breaking the House of Representatives and country. https://t.co/WxjK1SMLtD,2020-02-05 16:24:44,Twitter Web App,168,513

Closing arguments of the sham impeachment are now over. It’s time to acquit! From a rigged &amp; rushed House process to showing up to the Senate unable to demonstrate &amp; prove an impeachable offense this entire undertaking was a disaster from the start ripping our country in 1/2.,2020-02-03 20:13:11,Twitter Web App,122,528
It's outrageous that the far left anti-Trump Mayor of Port Jefferson is fining these amazing ice cream shop owners $2000 per DAY just for hanging a sign that supports the President. Being fined for their simple non controversial message of support for the President is nuts https://t.co/98yQwUjoKj,2020-02-03 01:08:08,Twitter Web App,634,939
In January 2021 the House of Representatives hopefully no longer under the grip of Nancy Pelosi and the far left controlling her should EXPUNGE this SHAM impeachment. The Dems teed up and delivered a corrupt rushed rigged process right from the start.,2020-02-02 15:14:58,Twitter for iPhone,94,322
We cut it close with everything going on in Washington but I'm truly grateful that I got to spend my 40th birthday in Port Jefferson with my wife &amp; daughters and hundreds of our family members friends &amp; amazing supporters.

Schiff &amp; Nadler keep saying there aren't witnesses. FALSE.   There were 17 &amp; Schiff called ALL OF THEM!   Not only was POTUS' counsel not allowed to call any witnesses by Schiff but his counsel wasn't even allowed in the room. This impeachment sham must end NOW w/an ACQUITTAL!,2020-01-31 16:12:55,Twitter Web App,126,339

POTUS’ counsel was obliterating Schiff’s fairy tale today in the Senate. This was predictable a mile away w Schiff relying desperately on presumptions lies hearsay &amp; 3% of the story to connect dots not actually connected.

After jamming their sham impeachment through the House with a corrupt rigged process it really takes some gall for Adam Schiff and his Dem cohorts to lecture the Senate and America on what a fair process should look like in the other chamber.,2020-01-22 14:42:02,Twitter Web App,20,71
During the House impeachment process Dems blocked ALL witnesses requested by GOP who were not also on the Dem list &amp; blocked POTUS' counsel from ALL closed door depos &amp; public Intel hearings.
