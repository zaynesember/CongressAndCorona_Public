I look forward to working with @Transition46 to deliver for the #TX15 starting with the selection of cabinet and senior government officials that look like and relate to our communities. (5/5),2020-11-27 15:11:26,Twitter Web App,3,14
I echo the sentiments of my @HispanicCaucus colleagues that President-elect @JoeBiden and @Transition46 should urgently consider appointing five Latinos to the cabinet.  (4/5),2020-11-27 15:11:26,Twitter Web App,6,31
We have been amongst the most loyal and qualified patriots for generations and are now laser focused in watching America’s new cabinet unfold. The expectations and demands of inclusion and participation could not be more clear. (3/5),2020-11-27 15:11:26,Twitter Web App,2,13
It is incumbent upon @Transition46 to nominate a cabinet that represents the American people and the more than 60.6 million Latinos in the United States out of which 62% are from Mexican American communities like mine. (2/5),2020-11-27 15:11:26,Twitter Web App,6,22
This last election showed growing concerns in Latino communities specifically Mexican Americans in South Texas and across our nation with @TheDemocrats . There is a clear anxiousness to see an America that represents them.  (1/5),2020-11-27 15:11:26,Twitter Web App,12,34
