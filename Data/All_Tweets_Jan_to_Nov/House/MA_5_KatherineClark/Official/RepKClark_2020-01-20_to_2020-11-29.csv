Under 40% of our population are POC but they account for over 50% of all #COVID19 deaths. We can't ignore this grave reality. @RepChuyGarcia and I along with 91 @HouseDemocrats are demanding the @CDCgov provide data to address pervasive inequalities in our #healthcare system. https://t.co/0Gez770tRj,2020-11-25 18:25:42,Twitter Web App,8,34

Trump's anti-immigrant agenda has 1 goal: stoke fear and division. His (unconstitutional) assault on the #Census2020 this week and his attack on #Dreamers are just 2 examples.

"Republicans are trying to cut off access to #healthcare during a pandemic. Now they're trying to eliminate fair wage protections in an economic crisis. This isn't just outrageous and disrespectful.

The #MovingForwardAct (finally) recognizes that #childcare is infrastructure. It's a public good fostering $99 billion in economic activity.

Ask any parent or early educator and they'll tell you that #childcare wasn't working before #COVID19. But now the system is in crisis.

One of the major steps of the #JusticeInPolicingAct is that it removes qualified immunity for police officers so that when something happens there's a way to achieve justice.,2020-06-12 16:27:18,Twitter Web App,5,9
Rev. Lloyd: There are officers who come in for the right reasons and want to make a difference.

We need a culture change.,2020-06-12 16:20:32,Twitter Web App,2,3
How do we move from a warrior to a guardian mentality?   Zane (@NAACP_MVAB): We need to get rid of this expectation among law enforcement that they're looking for crime.

Child care isn't a nicety. It's a necessity. Just ask any mom or dad.
