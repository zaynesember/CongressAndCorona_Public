On #VeteransDay we thank veterans for their service. The best way to honor our vets is by fighting for their health care access to housing &amp; mental health every day.

My dad was a carrier Air Force vet. I grew up around service members. I saw the sacrifice they make- the sacrifice their families’ make- firsthand.

I spent the Fall working on a bill to make student loans easier to take out &amp; cheaper to repay. The admin's budget cuts student loan programs by $170B.
