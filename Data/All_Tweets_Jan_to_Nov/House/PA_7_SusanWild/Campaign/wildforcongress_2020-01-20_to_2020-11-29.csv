I'm working to ensure equal pay for equal work &amp; to strengthen workplace protections for everyone in #PA07.

Day #12: When people ask me why I'm so adamant about working across the aisle I give them the simple answer – I do it because it works.   My priority is always #PA07 &amp; I'll run on my record of bipartisanship any day.  📹 creds: @69News https://t.co/QtIqWbBRj3,2020-10-22 22:08:20,Twitter for iPhone,3,6
Hey @B104– any chance you'll be playing this between now and November 3rd?   Seriously though thanks to @FallonTonight for giving a thorough (and catchy!) how-to on filling out your ballot in PA this year.    Watch the video below👇👇 https://t.co/XxVMCfuOYa,2020-10-22 19:55:49,Twitter for iPhone,2,4
My opponent says the SAME thing. From the top of the ticket all the way down the GOP is fixated on ripping apart a health care law that protects 300K people in #PA07 with pre-existing conditions.  And they can’t even be bothered to think of a plan to replace it.  Disqualifying. https://t.co/GVF5y6SRiO,2020-10-22 18:20:27,Twitter for iPhone,5,8
220K Americans have died &amp; 8.4M have contracted #COVID19 on your watch Mr. President. You’re committed to destroying the ACA but your plan to protect the 26M Americans you would leave without care is...what exactly?  Where have I heard this before...? 🤔 https://t.co/xr14d7kcNO,2020-10-22 18:20:22,Twitter for iPhone,6,11
Washington could use a solid dose of Lehigh Valley values.  I know that in #PA07 we value hard work &amp; common sense - 2 things we don’t always get enough of in DC. So for 2 years that has been my approach. And I've gotten a lot of work done because of it. https://t.co/7WZ6RfaTd4,2020-10-22 15:02:53,Twitter for iPhone,14,31

Love this.  This is the change we need to see. https://t.co/sQSuoxOoaR,2020-10-22 01:14:44,Twitter for iPhone,3,20
Day #13: In 2018 the American people elected an historic number of women to serve in the House– and for us passing the ERA was a no-brainer.   Representation matters. I’m in Congress to ensure that in #PA07 everyone’s rights are fully protected. https://t.co/m9wN1jCKKX,2020-10-21 22:17:24,Twitter for iPhone,1,4
Since we’re in a pandemic &amp; my opponent is dead set on repealing the ACA (which protects 300K people in #PA07 with pre-existing conditions) I wanted to know what her alternative plan for health care is.  Her answer?  *crickets*  (Spoiler: She just doesn’t have one) https://t.co/iAggERvLQS,2020-10-21 18:42:10,Twitter for iPhone,83,228

Day #14: With only 2 weeks to go I'm thinking about where we started.

Day 15: My kids went to public school in #PA07 so I understand how important it is for our schools &amp; teachers to be well-funded.   When #COVID19 hit I made securing relief for our schools a priority. I'd want that for my family. I demand it for yours.  https://t.co/7kEPnrBMhH,2020-10-19 22:54:35,Twitter for iPhone,2,5

I believe the only way we get things done is by finding common ground.

Day #19: Being a working parent is hard. I would know– I worked through both of my pregnancies.  That's why I support bills that make life easier for working families (like the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act).

A7: It’s time more people realized reproductive health care is just that: health care. I’m proud to champion bills that improve women’s health &amp; protect reproductive rights no matter what state you’re in. Government shouldn’t be involved in a woman’s health care choices. #ELCare https://t.co/c8mxNYuXxr,2020-09-25 17:58:32,Twitter for iPhone,6,17
A4: Just as we’ve seen with issues like black maternal mortality rates health disparities across racial lines are deep &amp; they deserve to be heard &amp; addressed at the highest levels. We have to fully fund &amp; protect critical health services like Medicare Medicaid &amp; CHIP. #ELCare https://t.co/mG97gvGZ4N,2020-09-25 17:48:09,Twitter for iPhone,7,10

I know politics can be rough but it’s the lying that bothers me.   My opponent's ad is untrue.

This election year must be about uniting our country and helping those struggling in the wake of this pandemic to recover and thrive.   @JoeBiden is a Pennsylvanian through and through –– his leadership is what we need at this moment. I am proud to endorse him for President. https://t.co/02GSrCRfnk,2020-04-08 21:51:15,Twitter for iPhone,4,33
This #WorldHealthDay is all about those on the frontlines of this pandemic.  Thank you to everyone working to keep #PA07 safe and healthy at @LVHN @MyStLukes and every other medical elderly care and mental health facility across our community. We are indebted to your service. https://t.co/r1apxkL2xl,2020-04-07 19:57:41,Twitter for iPhone,2,4

Today kicks off National Public Health Week (@NPHW) during what is expected to be an incredibly difficult week for many American families with more cases of #COVID19 spreading across our communities.   In this time of social distancing our mental health is at risk as well.,2020-04-06 22:01:38,Twitter for iPhone,3,5
A few of my favorite ways that folks across #PA07 are spending their weekend at home:  🌱 Hillary planting kale crops  ⛺️ Kate’s girls working on @girlscouts merit badges with a virtual backyard camp out  🔨 Chris fixing his garage door  📺 Lisa catching up on shows with her pup https://t.co/1j2y3F5adj https://t.co/ttrAAtMu65,2020-04-04 18:27:32,Twitter for iPhone,2,3

Weekends during this time of uncertainty don’t feel quite the same but remember — by staying home you help our neighbors and loved ones in #PA07 stay healthy.  Reply with a picture or story of how you’re passing the time at home and I’ll RT some of my favorites!,2020-04-04 16:51:51,Twitter for iPhone,2,1
@RepBenMcAdams @UofUHealth @CDCgov Happy you’re on the road to recovery my friend!,2020-04-03 03:13:16,Twitter for iPhone,1,4
The heroes of this crisis are the health care workers grocery store clerks mail carriers emergency responders and the everyday Americans coming together to get by.   To every essential worker across #PA07 thank you. When we come through this it will be because of YOU. https://t.co/cF0zeqPncy,2020-04-02 18:21:45,Twitter for iPhone,2,6
Today is #CensusDay2020! My census took less than 5 minutes to complete –– it’s fast it’s easy and it’s incredibly important in order to get the resources we need to our community.   Fill yours out today at: https://t.co/p5s5ysCZnD https://t.co/PNZHjwpbRH,2020-04-02 00:03:33,Twitter for iPhone,7,15
Everyone should have access to health insurance particularly right now. That’s why I co-led a bill with @Bob_Casey to open an emergency enrollment period. Let’s reopen the marketplace so people can get the health care they need. https://t.co/64x8if5gjD,2020-04-01 19:10:10,Twitter for iPhone,4,7
Today when women on the frontlines are putting their lives at equal risk equal pay is more important than ever. Last March we passed the #PaycheckFairnessAct in the House — the Senate never voted on it. Women can’t afford that. https://t.co/Pc8Dexbevp,2020-03-31 17:31:23,Twitter for iPhone,4,4

Today I saw a beautiful display of bipartisanship on the House floor. Members of both parties set aside their differences for the health safety and economic security of the American people.  I hope we can bring this spirit of unity into our work moving forward. https://t.co/tEICUncRKk,2020-03-27 21:48:56,Twitter for iPhone,3,17
@BigDaddyLemur @RepThomasMassie I have no problem working and have been doing so around the clock by phone and computer. I didn’t fly here I drove myself. I never ask anyone to get my beverages for me. I’ve done exactly as the scientists and doctors have asked all of us to do — stay home and work from there.,2020-03-27 20:35:26,Twitter for iPhone,0,12

After unanimously passing the House the president has signed the #OlderAmericansAct into law!  I'm proud to have co-led this initiative –– as we deal with the effects of #COVID19 on our seniors the resources that #OAA funds like Meals on Wheels will be critical.,2020-03-26 00:25:22,Twitter for iPhone,5,28

Today on the 10th anniv of the #ACA and in the midst of the #COVID19 pandemic I co-led a bicameral bill to establish an emergency open enrollment period so no one is left uninsured during this crisis.  Every American should have access to quality and affordable health care.,2020-03-24 01:36:06,Twitter for iPhone,2,15

Paid sick leave is a matter of public health.   We did our job in the House — we passed legislation to keep workers and members of the public safe. The Senate didn’t do theirs.  We can’t afford partisan politics while we work to combat #COVID19. https://t.co/1V09cT04Rt,2020-03-12 17:43:27,Twitter for iPhone,5,13
Proud to see the Senate take bipartisan action on an issue that has been a focus of my work in the House — we need to protect defrauded students with huge amounts of debt and nothing but worthless degrees to show for it. https://t.co/k40PCJR283,2020-03-12 13:59:31,Twitter for iPhone,3,7
