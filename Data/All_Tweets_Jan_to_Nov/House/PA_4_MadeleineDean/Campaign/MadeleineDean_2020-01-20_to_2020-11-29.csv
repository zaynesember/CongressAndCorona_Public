The best way to honor Representative Lewis' legacy is to stir up what he called "Good Trouble."   To fight for what we believe in. To care for those around us. And most of all to never give up in fighting for what we believe in.   #DemConvention2020,2020-08-21 01:31:19,Twitter Web App,3,12

To be conscious and compassionate about all people. For all of us - "no matter what we look like where we come from or who we love."   That is the true meaning of public service. She is truly Kamala Harris for the people.   #DemConvention2020,2020-08-20 03:01:02,Twitter Web App,6,26
Senator @KamalaHarris embodies the idea "it's about all of us."   She empowers &amp; lifts up women minorities Americans everywhere and will inspire so many in the White House.   #DemConvention2020,2020-08-20 02:55:02,Twitter Web App,4,20

The gun violence rates in the U.S. are not normal - they are sickening and tragic. The gun violence epidemic has taken too many innocent souls - it's time for change now.

"Women will decide this election." - Great quote from the delegate from TN.

The fight for equality and civil rights for all is still ongoing - but as MLK said the long arc bends towards justice.

His initiatives will help us Build Back Better.  #DemConvention2020,2020-08-19 01:36:05,Twitter Web App,4,12
Trump has consistently shown that he has no respect for the Constitution and rule of law - from the Muslim Travel Ban to suppressing the vote by denying USPS funding to weaponizing the Justice Department.
