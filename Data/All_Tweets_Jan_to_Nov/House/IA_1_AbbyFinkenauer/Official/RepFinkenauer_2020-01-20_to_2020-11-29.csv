Getting through this pandemic and keeping our communities strong requires serious bipartisan action — and that's what our friends and neighbors deserve. #IA01,2020-05-20 00:40:01,Twitter for iPhone,3,9
Thanks to everyone who joined our Dubuque small business roundtable. We heard small biz lender and community development perspectives about what they need to get through the COVID-19 pandemic &amp; how we can continue to ensure the PPP program works for Main Street businesses #IA01,2020-05-19 23:21:03,Twitter Web App,3,17
Tomorrow I’m leading a @HouseSmallBiz RATE subcommittee forum on the economic challenges facing rural communities amid the COVID-19 pandemic featuring Iowa experts from Grinnell and Kensett. Join us at https://t.co/nizQrV4qBU #IA01,2020-05-19 20:04:01,Twitter Web App,4,7

New visa guidelines will now allow international doctors to practice telemedicine giving our medical workforce more tools to fight COVID-19. I asked @USCIS for this flexibility last month; their approval means better care for patients in rural areas in #IA01 and across the USA,2020-05-13 00:48:12,Twitter for iPhone,3,12
I spoke with faith leaders in Waterloo today to hear their on-the-ground concerns about the safety of our essential workers and vulnerable communities. I'm committed to listening to Iowans taking your concerns to Washington and fighting for the change you need. #IA01,2020-05-12 23:52:24,Twitter for iPhone,5,36
Our mayors are defending the renewable fuels industry as Big Oil attempts to use this pandemic to undercut American biofuels and circumvent the law. I’m proud to stand with local leaders and will be sending my own message to the @EPA very soon. #IA01 https://t.co/5yElx19TrQ,2020-05-12 20:44:01,Twitter for iPhone,5,16
I introduced a bill today to make sure renters in Iowa know about their rights under the CARES Act. This simple transparency would prevent landlords from sending illegal eviction notices – like what happened at an Iowa mobile home park last month. #IA01 https://t.co/ZAe0wEXs2W,2020-05-12 19:07:59,Twitter for iPhone,5,16
The Paycheck Protection Program is critical to protecting small businesses during this crisis but we must provide oversight &amp; recover any funds claimed by big corporations at the expense of Main Street biz. My comments during @HouseSmallBiz hearing https://t.co/tyIsJ2eMGE,2020-05-08 17:21:11,Twitter Web App,3,9
Direct assistance for communities is one of my top priorities for any new aid package. https://t.co/cUiJ6NNKOO,2020-05-07 14:21:17,Twitter Web App,1,1
ICYMI: It was great to speak with the @IowaLeague last week provide an update on federal COVID-19 aid for #IA01 municipalities and hear what we need to keep our cities and towns strong during this crisis.,2020-05-07 14:21:16,Twitter Web App,1,4
On #NationalNursesDay we recognize the nurses who are keeping us safe from coronavirus in our hospitals our long-term care facilities and in our homes. We must take care of them too with adequate PPE and hazard pay. #IA01,2020-05-07 01:33:50,Twitter for iPhone,4,31
Last month an out-of-state company tried to evict mobile home park residents in Dubuque — even though Congress passed a law to stop evictions during the pandemic. Now I’m pushing to make sure tenants know their rights. #IA01 https://t.co/U23eQhKs9n,2020-05-06 19:26:14,Twitter for iPhone,6,24
Even in a crisis we can see our teachers' hard work love &amp; dedication. Across #IA01 educators are still teaching hosting video chats handing out lunches &amp; more. When schools close our teachers still show up &amp; make a difference. Thank you all! 🍎❤ #TeacherAppreciationWeek,2020-05-06 17:04:32,Twitter Web App,3,21
.@RepCindyAxne and @daveloebsack joined me in asking the president to order production of PPE for our essential workforce. As we move to reopen Iowa meat processing plants we must keep our workers and communities safe. We’re asking our senators &amp; governor to join our call. #IA01,2020-05-06 13:37:40,Twitter for iPhone,20,125
Read my priorities here: https://t.co/cUiJ6NNKOO #IA01,2020-05-05 17:50:48,Twitter for iPhone,0,3
ICYMI: I had a great meeting with @IowaAFLCIO leaders last week to talk about our Coronavirus response and how we can help workers through this challenging time. I’m calling for higher safety standards hazard pay subsidized COBRA payments &amp; more. https://t.co/CGCBuFsx2p,2020-05-05 17:50:48,Twitter for iPhone,5,22
We must do more. Strong safety standards are just the start — to keep our facilities up and running our essential workers also need adequate PPE and REAL enforcement to hold employers accountable. #IA01,2020-05-04 16:03:43,Twitter Web App,0,11
But I remain concerned about enforcement and opportunities for workers to report unsafe conditions. Based on what I heard from the undersecretary there will be no systematic enforcement to ensure employers follow safety standards — that oversight would be up to states. #IA01,2020-05-04 16:03:43,Twitter Web App,3,10
I just spoke with Dr. Mindy Brashears the @USDA undersecretary for food safety. I appreciate USDA OSHA and CDC efforts in recent weeks to provide safety standards and guidance for food processing plants struggling in the Coronavirus pandemic. #IA01,2020-05-04 16:03:42,Twitter Web App,2,15
I can’t stress enough how disappointed I am that biofuels were denied aid from @USDA — but I'm proud to join Sec. Vilsack and Lt. Gov. Judge in the fight to support our growers &amp; producers. I’ll demand assistance in any new COVID-19 aid package. #IA01 https://t.co/XQhVEYOp0H,2020-05-03 17:53:16,Twitter for iPhone,15,54
I spoke yesterday afternoon with letter carriers who are delivering critical supplies like Rx drugs across #IA01 during this crisis. I'm committed to ensuring @USPS has the resources it needs to provide this essential service in every corner of America.,2020-04-30 13:52:51,Twitter for iPhone,17,93
My statement on executive order to keep food processing plants open #IA01 https://t.co/vgSiAASf6A,2020-04-28 20:27:26,Twitter for iPhone,56,143
Read my full priority list here: https://t.co/cUiJ6NNKOO and let us know what else is need by filling out our Iowa coronavirus impact form: https://t.co/nmDQCxdfz2,2020-04-28 18:44:55,Twitter Web App,1,2
Families and business across #IA01 rely on the Postal Service for critical services and supplies. We must provide resources to keep the USPS strong and able to provide key services — without strings that threaten its long-term viability.,2020-04-28 18:44:55,Twitter Web App,9,20
Our ag economy has been hit especially hard by this crisis — and so far received inadequate help from the administration. Our next package must include more help for producers who have lost markets due to coronavirus as well as targeted assistance for biofuels producers. #IA01,2020-04-28 18:44:55,Twitter Web App,3,14
Local governments will require additional federal support to offset funding shortfalls caused by this economic slowdown. We must lower the population requirement for direct aid to ensure this support reaches smaller cities and counties like those in #IA01.,2020-04-28 18:44:54,Twitter Web App,2,5
We cannot leave students and schools behind in this crisis. The next package should extend student loan deferments guarantee work-study compensation for students and ensure school districts and colleges have resources to meet changing needs — including distance learning. #IA01,2020-04-28 18:44:54,Twitter Web App,1,4
We must make it easier — not harder — to access health care during this crisis. The next package should create a special enrollment period for the health care exchanges subsidize COBRA payments for workers and increase premium tax credits to make coverage more affordable. #IA01,2020-04-28 18:44:54,Twitter Web App,0,4
Congress should approve additional direct payments for families and ensure parents receive payments for all children claimed as dependents including those in college. We also must provide additional aid to state unemployment systems and extend federal aid beyond July. #IA01,2020-04-28 18:44:54,Twitter Web App,0,2
First of all we must do more to protect and support essential workers — from our doctors and nurses to grocery store clerks and food processing plant workers. I’m calling for hazard pay and higher safety standards — along with wider access to PPE and rapid testing. #IA01,2020-04-28 18:44:53,Twitter Web App,1,4
I’ve been meeting with and hearing from constituents from across #IA01 since this crisis began. These priorities are their priorities — the resources they say are most needed to protect their health and economic security.,2020-04-28 18:44:53,Twitter Web App,0,2
Today I released my priorities for the next coronavirus relief package. With our families and communities still hurting we must come together to provide additional aid and slow the spread of COVID-19 https://t.co/2O6l8Z0CG1 #IA01,2020-04-28 18:44:53,Twitter Web App,6,14
That said more information and oversight is critical during this time. I’m committed to ensuring our federal government continues to deliver as it should for farmers workers and consumers and will be holding @USDA and @CDCgov accountable going forward. #IA01,2020-04-27 17:51:35,Twitter Web App,1,2
I sent letters earlier this month seeking action along these lines and I’m glad to see @USDA and @CDC heeding that call and showing leadership to protect our workers and our food supply. https://t.co/wzztoeh2Wp #IA01,2020-04-27 17:51:34,Twitter Web App,0,1
.@CDCgov also finally issued industry-specific guidance for meat and poultry processing workers and employers — an absolutely essential step to address the outbreaks we’re seeing across the country and across #IA01. https://t.co/uRYK7zP9g4,2020-04-27 17:51:34,Twitter Web App,2,1
.@USDA is establishing a National Incident Coordination Center to provide direct support to producers help identify alternative markets and advise &amp; assist on depopulation and disposal if necessary. https://t.co/11xpHl3EYB,2020-04-27 17:51:34,Twitter Web App,0,0
I’m happy to see @USDA and @CDCgov taking important steps to help our livestock producers and essential workers as we fight the COVID-19 pandemic and outbreaks at our processing plants. #IA01,2020-04-27 17:51:33,Twitter Web App,4,13
I voted yesterday to expand the Paycheck Protection Program and ensure small business aid reaches Main Street businesses in #IA01. Now it's time to get to work on a new relief package providing more help to workers families and our local governments. https://t.co/R66Ss9rVJl,2020-04-24 17:23:51,Twitter Web App,4,44
On Monday @USDA announced $19B in Coronavirus aid — but not a penny for biofuels. Now CR is losing an ethanol plant furloughing 90 workers &amp; cutting off an essential market for farmers. We must support producers &amp; keep the Midwestern economy strong. #IA01 https://t.co/V7DILySpdd,2020-04-23 23:30:28,Twitter Web App,21,47
Statement on Passage of Additional Funding for Small Business Paycheck Protection Program Hospitals and Healthcare Providers #IA01 https://t.co/5cMqh2QRS3,2020-04-23 22:18:01,Twitter for iPhone,5,8
Today we’re expanding the Paycheck Protection Program w/ assurances that community-based financial institutions will have access to funds to lend to the Main Street businesses who need it most. Today I shared the story of one #IA01 small business at our @Housesmallbiz hearing. https://t.co/sv19MdVINB,2020-04-23 19:27:34,Twitter for iPhone,6,29
This package contains critical support for small businesses and hospitals as well as expanded testing necessary to reopen our economy. I’m especially glad to see $60B reserved for smaller lenders who serve our Main Street businesses. Let’s vote! #IA01 https://t.co/GTX7gx18ce,2020-04-21 21:00:28,Twitter Web App,6,18
Why are colleges &amp; universities being left behind on emergency COVID-19 payments? We’ve learned it’s because @usedgov didn’t do its job.  Less than 1% of the aid has actually been sent. This is unacceptable &amp; @RepPorter and I are urging the Dept. of Ed. to fix this problem #IA01,2020-04-21 17:36:04,Twitter Web App,31,129
Our farmers and producers need all the help they can get amid the coronavirus pandemic and Trump’s ongoing trade war — but any aid package that leaves out support for biofuels is inadequate and unacceptable. We must do better than this. #IA01 https://t.co/xM1lJmAI8Y,2020-04-20 20:02:54,Twitter for iPhone,6,7
This is unacceptable. Small business loans should go to small businesses period. That’s why I’m working with @RepJudyChu to hold the SBA accountable to Main Street — not Wall Street. #IA01 https://t.co/WPlG365UQx,2020-04-20 17:27:32,Twitter Web App,3,10
I'm also asking the USDA and DOL to provide testing personal protective equipment and leave policies that put employee health ahead of the bottom line. Employers need resources and clarity on how to protect workers. #IA01,2020-04-17 20:12:05,Twitter Web App,0,4
I’m asking the CDC to develop industry-specific guidelines for food production just as they have for air travel. This is to ensure there are consistent responses to prevent and manage outbreaks in plants in #IA01 &amp; across the country.,2020-04-17 20:12:04,Twitter Web App,0,6
Iowans working at our processing plants must be protected during this crisis. Today I called on federal agencies develop standards and deliver on-the-ground help. #IA01  https://t.co/wzztoeh2Wp,2020-04-17 20:12:04,Twitter Web App,11,33
Essential workers in Iowa and across the country are facing shortages of the protective gear they need in the fight against COVID-19. It's time for the president to use his authority to produce more live-saving PPE. #IA01 https://t.co/Xm3faehYjk,2020-04-16 16:09:48,Twitter Web App,16,44
This shouldn't be happening: Iowa nurses are scared to go to work because we don’t have enough PPE to keep them safe. It’s past time to invoke the Defense Production Act to produce more PPE. I’m co-sponsoring a bill to make Trump do exactly that. #IA01 https://t.co/liWmIZ6viH,2020-04-15 16:03:16,Twitter for iPhone,84,187
We cannot allow this administration to hand out billions with no transparency or accountability. I’m asking the SBA and other agencies for data on grant and loan awards to ensure help is reaching Main Street businesses in Iowa and across the country. #IA01 https://t.co/jBSM02nnUo,2020-04-15 14:29:32,Twitter for iPhone,18,61

We’re leading a bipartisan call for the Small Business Administration to staff its Office of Rural Affairs. During this pandemic we need this critical office to up and running to support our rural small businesses. #IA01 https://t.co/OXrRtcTsm7,2020-04-13 23:11:08,Twitter for iPhone,2,3
From our farmers and producers to our packers and manufacturers Iowa is essential to our national food system. I’m deeply concerned about these outbreaks and our state’s lack of access to PPE to keep critical workers safe. #IA01 https://t.co/FMIaTzw1qK,2020-04-13 21:50:14,Twitter Web App,8,23
Head Start programs in Marshalltown will receive a $1.7 mil. grant as part of the CARES Act the COVID-19 relief bill we passed.

Small businesses are depending on federal help to weather this historic economic disruption &amp; we cannot fail them.

Re-opening ACA marketplaces and allowing uninsured Iowans to enroll in health plans could save lives and ensure financial security during the coronavirus pandemic. I sent a letter to HHS Sec.

I urge a 'stay-at-home' order for the health &amp; well-being of our fellow Iowans &amp; also for our country.
