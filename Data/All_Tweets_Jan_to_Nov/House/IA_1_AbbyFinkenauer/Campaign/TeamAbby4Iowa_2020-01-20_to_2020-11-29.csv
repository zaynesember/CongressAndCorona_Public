On two separate claims @gazettedotcom gave @HinsonAshley a D and an F for lying about @Abby4Iowa's record.   And here’s the thing: With @HinsonAshley’s record of hurting #IA01 workers &amp; undermining access to health care lies like this are all she’s got.  https://t.co/aRyPXmNdo3,2020-07-21 13:51:46,Twitter Web App,9,9
.@HinsonAshley touts her work as a journalist — and then degrades her former profession when it's politically convenient.
