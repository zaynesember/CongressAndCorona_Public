Arizona is seeing the worst of this pandemic. We outpace the U.S. and the world in new cases 2000 people are dead &amp; hospitals are more stressed than ever.  We need action now: 1. Expand testing and lab capacity 2. Implement a real contact tracing plan 3. Mandate masks statewide,2020-07-09 19:13:28,Twitter Web App,23,86
