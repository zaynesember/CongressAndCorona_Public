Today’s my 50th. So of course @NicoleStantonAZ and @KateWGallego share a good laugh at my expense 😅. After 7 elections and 20 years in public life I’m more thankful than ever for the support from my family and the honor of serving our great community. https://t.co/HuiRWr8sZn,2020-03-09 02:05:16,Twitter for iPhone,11,177
Our community mourns the loss today of firefighter Tommy Arriaga. He bravely served Tempe on the department’s Hazardous Materials Response Team until his diagnosis in 2019. My prayers are with the Arriagas and the Tempe Fire family. https://t.co/6XKyLND02u,2020-03-06 21:12:53,Twitter for iPhone,3,31

Who knows what @realDonaldTrump will say in Phoenix tonight. But I bet he won't mention his plan to:  - cut Medicare by $500 million - cut Medicaid by $900 million - cut Social Security by $24 billion - cut student aid by $170 billion  I'll hold the line against these #TrumpCuts.,2020-02-19 22:18:34,Twitter for iPhone,118,344
On Saturday I saw “¡Americano! The Musical” @phxtheatre. It’s the  inspiring story of my friend and DREAMer Tony Valdovinos. Great music with an important message to Arizona: DREAMers are an essential part of our state deserve our full support and American citizenship. https://t.co/8aBZSfbGyI,2020-02-03 18:35:50,Twitter for iPhone,15,67

.@DrBobParsons and @ReneeLParsons have done it again. Their generosity will ensure that 35 hard-working Dreamers have the opportunity to pursue their goals at @ASU.
