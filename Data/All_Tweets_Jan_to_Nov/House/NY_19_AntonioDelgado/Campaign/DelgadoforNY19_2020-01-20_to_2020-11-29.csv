The lack of urgency from the Senate Majority to move legislation like the Heroes Act is exacerbating this crisis. Millions of Americans are unemployed. Local businesses need additional relief. We must give our communities the tools they need to survive. https://t.co/MtxuL9CnJW,2020-09-14 17:32:51,Twitter for iPhone,10,25
Programs like PPP &amp; EIDL have ended but many #smallbiz still need help to stay afloat. I'll keep pushing for the RESTART Act which would allow small &amp; mid-sized businesses to access partially forgivable loans to help cover 6 months of business expenses. https://t.co/B7hzA7gqm3,2020-09-14 15:47:09,Twitter for iPhone,5,12

It is the duty of the federal government to promote the general welfare. The House passed the Heroes Act more than 120 days ago and yet the Senate continues to fail to offer legislation that addresses the true depth of this crisis.,2020-09-13 14:26:14,Twitter for iPhone,7,30
We are the richest nation in the world and nearly half of U.S. households are facing a financial crisis. Almost 40% of American adults aren't able to make a $400 emergency expense. This is indefensible. https://t.co/mnN2jmfY1g,2020-09-13 14:26:12,Twitter for iPhone,16,40

For 6 months state &amp; local govts have provided urgently needed #COVID19 resources while facing a dire fiscal future. We can't abandon our local partners in their time of need.

Many music venues &amp; businesses in our area have been closed for months &amp; w/o federal support we could lose these cultural centers forever.

Glad to see the national eviction moratorium extended to more Americans in these challenging times but this cannot replace our work in Congress to provide needed relief. The House passed the #HeroesAct months ago. The Senate must stop standing in the way. https://t.co/6sf80xfb1T,2020-09-03 21:58:32,Twitter for iPhone,5,25
It is egregious that in the wealthiest nation in the world one in eight families don’t have enough to eat. #COVID19 has exacerbated food insecurity that was already plaguing our rural communities and we cannot sit idly by as families go hungry. https://t.co/6Xq33rNTJB,2020-09-03 19:09:20,Twitter for iPhone,7,16
We know our elections were interfered with back in 2016 &amp; we must stand ready to protect our democracy in 2020.

What’s not uncertain: ➡️ State &amp; local govts need relief ➡️ Millions of Americans are unemployed ➡️ Direct payments from March aren’t enough ➡️ Small biz owners &amp; farmers are stressed over cold weather ahead ➡️ Testing &amp; PPE must be at the needed capacity  https://t.co/Jq6LHaCprp,2020-09-03 16:12:52,Twitter for iPhone,8,18
Small farmers were already facing a difficult farm economy &amp; #COVID19 has placed an additional strain on small producers. My Helping America's Farmers Act would create an Ag-EIDL program to give family farmers in #NY19 additional tools to stay afloat. https://t.co/dvtOC1H9zY,2020-09-02 20:59:42,Twitter for iPhone,8,18
Once again the Trump Administration is undermining vital environmental protections that help keep our waterways and drinking water safe from harmful substances.

#NY19 suffers from some of the highest overdose rates in the state.

Congress required the Admin to write a comprehensive testing plan in April. The HHS response fell woefully short leaving states to fill in the gaps.

I’ve heard from folks at home across the political spectrum about the urgent need for state &amp; local funding.  Yet the proposal put forth by Senate Republicans amounts to not one cent.

Our health care system leaves millions of families paying more for basic health coverage &amp; prescription drugs. I introduced the Medicare-X Choice Act which would achieve universal health care by adding a public option to lower costs &amp; increase choice. https://t.co/CJYUdvhq1S,2020-01-30 18:15:58,Twitter for iPhone,6,19

#NY19 is home to more than 27000 small biz &amp; self-employed owners.
