Getting it right more important than rush to "accept results."   Majority of Americans don't trust U.S. elections. To restore trust: - Count every legal vote - Recount where appropriate - Examine irregularities as per law.   Don't suppress 400k uncounted ballots.

QUESTIONS About $2.2 trillion #Pelosi Covid bill up for House vote today:   1. Should Americans get paid more on Unemployment than they get while working?   2. Amid the pandemic - with families struggling - should millionaires get a tax windfall?   #Wasteful,2020-09-30 20:51:11,Twitter Web App,9,28
Even though @SpeakerPelosi refused to let Democrats participate in crucial @China_TaskForce many of the recommendations by @HouseGOP are bipartisan.   That's the right approach.     https://t.co/SULsVWxozE,2020-09-30 18:27:42,Twitter Web App,5,7
.#Trump has done "virtually nothing" for African Americans?   - Unemployment for Black Americans reached all time lows. - Poverty rates at record lows. - Wealth inequality shrank. - Women of color winning jobs race.  - #OpportunityZones driving $billions to poor communities.,2020-09-30 17:58:43,Twitter Web App,26,47
Congratulations fellow Texan @RepMcCaul for leading GOP efforts on the @China_TaskForce.   Responsibly &amp; directly tackling China's behavior that threatens America's national security economy &amp; medical security should be a top priority for Congress. https://t.co/boRGvco0hz,2020-09-30 15:47:03,Twitter Web App,276,276

SERIOUSLY? #Pelosi Covid aid 'show vote" includes some help for small biz &amp; airlines.   But also:  - early release of criminals - defund police - stimulus checks for undocumented - fed control of elections - marijuana  - big tax breaks for millionaires in Dem states.    #Wasteful https://t.co/pFCV0F10Rs,2020-09-30 15:33:28,Twitter Web App,14,24
WHO’S NEXT? A felony crime was possibly committed by illegally releasing the private tax returns of #PresidentTrump.  So every American remains protected against the illegal release of their tax returns for political reasons I call for an investigation.  https://t.co/3vvgJZaYj3,2020-09-29 17:44:56,Twitter for iPad,853,1681

Thx for standing up for Kansas small/rural cities &amp; counties @RepRonEstes.   Kansas - and 31 other states - should not be hoarding the #CARES funding Congress intended to be passed on to smaller communities to help with COVID-19 expenses. https://t.co/HdgIB5Q6qS,2020-05-20 19:44:34,Twitter Web App,8,12
When it comes to reopening the economy Texas proves you can protect lives &amp; livelihoods at the same time.

CORRECT.  Congress intended larger counties getting #CARES aid directly - based on population - to help the small cities within their jurisdiction offset the unexpected costs of battling COVID-19.
