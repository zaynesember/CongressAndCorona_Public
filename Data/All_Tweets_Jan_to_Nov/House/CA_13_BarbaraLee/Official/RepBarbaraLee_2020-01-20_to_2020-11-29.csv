I'm closely monitoring developments about the coronavirus and I'm glad @CDCgov will begin screening passengers at SFO for symptoms.

This just underscores the need for a fair and open trial in the Senate.    The American people deserve to hear the full facts of the case – and that includes having witnesses testify and documents produced. #DefendOurDemocracy https://t.co/9ovlS0ixO9,2020-01-28 16:33:04,TweetDeck,33,98

Three years ago Trump issued his xenophobic and Islamophobic Muslim Travel Ban undermining our values &amp; Constitution.

Trump’s #SNAP rule will have devastating effects on families across the country. Kicking people off of food assistance won’t help people find employment – it'll just make them hungrier while local governments struggle to meet increased need. #HandsOffSNAP https://t.co/GcSbpEV7XH,2020-01-27 19:22:00,TweetDeck,52,99
A fair trial has witnesses and documents – the Senate GOP is blocking both. The American people deserve the truth – and that starts with having John Bolton testify. #DefendOurDemocracy https://t.co/u9CA46GOZW,2020-01-27 18:40:32,TweetDeck,42,134

Congress cannot afford to abdicate our responsibility on war and peace any longer – it's time to pass my bill to repeal the 2002 AUMF and @RepRoKhanna's bill to block unauthorized funds for war with Iran. #StopEndlessWar https://t.co/NFYlWi72cO,2020-01-24 20:23:09,TweetDeck,35,102
