13 million children live below the poverty line and 2/3 of those children are people of color. In the wealthiest nation in the world there is no reason any child should ever go hungry.  We HAVE the tools to eradicate child poverty we just need the political will to do it.,2020-01-27 02:17:00,Sprout Social,416,1834
There is not a single county in the U.S. where the average cost of living and the average Social Security benefit are equal.

Rather than promoting housing desegregation the Trump administration wants to focus on “choice.” Which is just a clever way to legally allow segregation. We must take meaningful actions that address racial disparities and truly integrate communities. https://t.co/OqaxKXQVMC,2020-01-26 19:31:00,Sprout Social,13,45
I hated politics until I met Shirley Chisholm. After she scolded me for not being registered to vote she inspired me to work on her 1972 presidential campaign and eventually run for office myself. I'm forever grateful for her mentorship. I would not be here without her.,2020-01-26 02:28:00,Sprout Social,517,5595

Shirley Chisholm is often remembered for being the first African American woman elected to Congress. But she should also be remembered for what she accomplished.

Shirley Chisholm launched her historic campaign for president today in 1972. She inspired women of color including me to get involved in politics. Today we honor her legacy by continuing to fight for seats at the table. And if they won’t make room we’ll bring folding chairs. https://t.co/puPJsSHr6q,2020-01-25 18:04:01,Sprout Social,105,473
Enough is enough. We must make significant investments to end homelessness at all levels — which means increasing access to affordable housing closing the racial wealth gap and eliminating barriers for people of color to thrive. https://t.co/ISfRCv8wJr,2020-01-25 03:26:00,Sprout Social,33,127

We now have refugees fleeing their home countries to escape the deadly consequences of climate change.
