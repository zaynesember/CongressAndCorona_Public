If you are a young woman and you see a problem in your community your state or your country: take on the challenge of fixing it. Work with others for your cause.

I am so inspired by this freshmen class of women who bring new voices and perspectives to the table.

When I came to Congress in 1989 there were only 31 women in the legislative branch and today there are 127.  While this is significant it is still not enough. Only 359 women have served in Congress compared with almost 12000 men and most of these have been white women.,2020-08-18 21:02:25,Twitter for iPhone,0,2
Suffrage was not immediately granted to all women and it is constantly threatened by those who seek to suppress the votes of women of color. The work to combat these forces is ongoing and barriers that impede people from participating in the democratic process still exist today.,2020-08-18 21:01:46,Twitter for iPhone,1,1

#SocialSecurity is more vital than ever as many Americans face uncertain economic futures amidst COVID-19.

Black women in the US lose nearly $1 million to the #WageGap over their working lifetimes earning only 61 cents to every dollar white men earn.

@USPS can handle snow rain heat and has now proven to work through a pandemic. It is clear the President is politicizing the Postal Service for his own political gain putting our electoral system in jeopardy and disenfranchising millions in the process.,2020-08-13 22:01:59,Twitter for iPhone,4,12
Funding the @USPS is essential during the COVID-19 pandemic yet the Trump Admin continues its efforts to weaken the postal service.

Our utility companies have failed to learn from past storms. #Isaias left thousands of NYers without power &amp; restoration times have yet to be announced.

As we mark the first anniversaries of these tragedies gun violence continues to be a problem in the US because we allow it to be. It’s long past time we provide Americans the protection they deserve. #DisarmHate #EndGunViolence,2020-08-04 23:34:16,Twitter for iPhone,2,3

Congress provided the VA with $3.5 billion over three years for electronic health records management. Yet servicemembers still can’t easily transfer medical records electronically when they seek VA care.

The Trump Administration would have us believe their education budget proposal empowers states and districts with flexibility but the numbers don’t lie.

Another senseless tragedy this time in Milwaukee.

In the face of public health crises the Trump Admin has consistently stalled neglecting to provide the necessary resources Americans need.

The Trump Administration is now illegally attempting to do through guidance what they failed to do legislatively.   Block grants hurt the very people Medicaid is here to help.
