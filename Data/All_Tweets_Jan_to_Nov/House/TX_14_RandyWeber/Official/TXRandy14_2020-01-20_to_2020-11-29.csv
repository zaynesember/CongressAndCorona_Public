@pjlee1 This was the first ever purely partisan impeachment. You are correct the burden of proof should not be with one party but with those who bring the allegations.  Just so happens in this case it was only Democrats.,2020-02-03 20:15:23,Twitter Web App,2,9
Finally there was no obstruction. The President retains executive privilege. Again if House leadership was concerned with obtaining subpoenaed documents they had the opportunity to take their case to the courts. This was never about the truth only smearing @realDonaldTrump 3/3,2020-02-03 20:02:16,Twitter Web App,24,62
This narrative about no witnesses is simply false. There were 17 witness testimonies entered into the record. The House had every opportunity to pursue lawsuits to compel witness and document subpoenas - but didn't. 2/3,2020-02-03 20:02:15,Twitter Web App,21,53

And how many times do you see a “jury” in a regular trial tell the prosecution we need to go out and get more witnesses?

.@RepAdamSchiff says  a trial without   witnesses is no trial at all. That’s because when they prosecuted their “case” in the House they gave the Republicans a chance to call witnesses?
