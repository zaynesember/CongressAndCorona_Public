A wonderful example of Coloradans #DoingMyPartCO in Lyons helping our first-responders &amp; most vulnerable. Proud to support their efforts by sending a letter to @US_FDA to expand it further!    Kudos to Mayor @crsullivan16 for her leadership!    https://t.co/HORvVWJptN,2020-03-20 14:13:53,Twitter for iPhone,27,94
Thanks to @SBAgov for responding to our letter &amp; granting @GovofCO's application for a disaster declaration to assist small businesses.    An important first step but we must keep fighting for monetary relief for families workers &amp; our small businesss! https://t.co/UI4NVxB7bI,2020-03-19 20:40:42,Twitter for iPhone,22,88

#DoingMyPartCO by meeting by phone with scientists at @ColoradoStateU (who are working tirelessly to develop a #covid19 vaccine!) donating to my local food pantry &amp; fighting for immediate economic relief for families  I challenge my friends @kcbecker @RepJeniArndt &amp; @Ed4Colorado https://t.co/ArnkeOD1MT,2020-03-17 22:57:32,Twitter for iPhone,16,151
Proud to support this bold proposal from my friend @RepJoeKennedy.   Families across Colorado are hurting and they need assistance NOW not later. It is long past time for Congress to step up and act boldly.   Let's get it done!   #ForThePeople https://t.co/hBCOt3Aj6w,2020-03-17 22:38:50,Twitter for iPhone,19,78
Grateful to work with such thoughtful local and state leaders including Governor Polis who continues to effectively lead us during this crisis.  As we confront the challenges ahead we must take every precaution and remember to be kind to each other.   We're in this together. https://t.co/6xKyMOkDCo,2020-03-16 00:44:05,Twitter for iPhone,12,98

Just after midnight the House passed our #FamiliesFirst legislation to help communities respond to the #CoronavirusPandemic.   The Senate must do the same.   Not next month.   Not next week.   Now.  Let's get this done!,2020-03-14 11:50:06,Twitter for iPhone,14,98
It is 1:00 am here in D.C. and we just passed the #FamiliesFirst Coronavirus Act!   Proud to work on this critical bill #ForThePeople and looking forward to heading home to #Colorado in a few hours to continue working with our incredible local leaders to protect our community. https://t.co/bJMOiQsxx1,2020-03-14 05:01:00,Twitter for iPhone,34,227
My friend &amp; colleague @MikeLevin is spot-on.   We must pass our comprehensive legislation that puts #FamiliesFirst by providing paid sick &amp; emergency leave free testing &amp; more.   And @HouseDemocrats won't leave Washington until we do.  #CoronavirusPandemic https://t.co/46Apw8Gh7V,2020-03-13 18:39:25,Twitter for iPhone,9,35
Thank you to everyone who took time out of their Saturday to caucus today with @coloradodems @BoulderDems &amp; @LarimerDems -- great to see so many folks out across the 2nd District engaging in our democracy! #GOTV #BlueWave2020 https://t.co/tzUHZFgROc,2020-03-08 00:29:16,Twitter for iPhone,6,36
The safety and wellbeing of Coloradans is of greatest importance and we are doing everything we can to disseminate accurate information on detection prevention and response and assist our state &amp; local partners in Summit County and elsewhere. https://t.co/rlAnHGr2cj,2020-03-06 20:47:33,Twitter for iPhone,4,17
To be clear the President's own budget proposal actually cuts funding for this program by over 90%— nearly eviscerating the funding.   #LWCF is a critical program that Coloradans rely on.    It must be a priority not an afterthought. https://t.co/P30UyexGTT,2020-03-03 22:31:59,Twitter for iPhone,34,71
From Granby to Fort Collins Boulder to Idaho Springs and many places in between -- traveling across the district the past 3 days one thing is crystal clear:   @coloradodems are fired up about winning in November!!   #GOTV #BlueWave2020 https://t.co/iNJQeap25d,2020-02-23 18:19:08,Twitter for iPhone,5,42
"For a 3rd grade project she wrote a letter to Rep. Neguse about her need for a bone-anchored hearing aid &amp; that it's not covered by insurance. Neguse however didn't stop at returning her letter; he introduced a bill that could help families like hers." https://t.co/HmIKx67uS0,2020-02-23 16:58:36,Twitter for iPhone,5,31
"In a markup in the U.S. House Judiciary Committee last week members approved an amendment from U.S. Rep. Joe Neguse to the NO BAN Act that would overturn President Trump’s executive order from January to restrict visas to four African countries." https://t.co/f4jaOZnpM8,2020-02-18 16:17:51,Twitter for iPhone,9,35
I’ve been honored to join @sully_720 in his work to save lives and thanks to his leadership and tenacity last year Colorado took action to #EndGunViolence.  We must continue to keep pushing for these common-sense reforms.    Retweet if you’re ready to join us.  #EnoughIsEnough https://t.co/PBMmXz24TM,2020-02-16 16:04:54,Twitter for iPhone,18,39

This is an erosion of the rule of law happening in plain sight.   Attorney General Barr must testify before Congress.   Immediately. https://t.co/2pCzpSXTQk,2020-02-11 23:08:42,Twitter for iPhone,32,99
Enjoyed joining the #Broomfield community to celebrate Christine Cerrato's selection as #Colorado’s Mother of the Year!

"Rep. Neguse was one of a handful of lawmakers and gun violence prevention advocates who held a press conference outside the Capitol in Washington D.C. to talk about the gun violence epidemic." https://t.co/dQ0dpPJJ0c #HR8 #GunViolencePrevention #EnoughIsEnough,2020-02-08 14:55:46,Twitter for iPhone,7,34
Attorney General Barr is the first AG in nearly 30 years who has refused to testify before the House Judiciary Committee.    Jeff Sessions Alberto Gonzales Janet Reno &amp; more -- they ALL testified.  It is outrageous and shameful. And the House shouldn't tolerate it any longer. https://t.co/KzCEebqqQg,2020-02-07 12:10:16,Twitter for iPhone,1475,4033
As we rightfully applaud @SenatorRomney for his patriotism today let us also remember to thank my friend and colleague @justinamash whose moral courage during the House impeachment proceedings will be remembered for many years to come.   #ImpeachmentTrial   #CountryOverParty,2020-02-05 20:32:16,Twitter for iPhone,27,176
During yesterday's #SOTU the President failed to mention gun violence prevention so today I led an event w/@lucymcbath @TedDeutch and Tom Mauser to demand the Senate take action on #HR8.   Not next week. Not next month.   NOW.   #EnoughIsEnough   @MomsDemand @GiffordsCourage https://t.co/SWJPh1dQoJ,2020-02-05 16:44:28,Twitter for iPhone,111,378
The President's speech tonight offered nothing but more of the same divisiveness and fear-mongering he's been peddling for years.    Rather than unite the country he once again and true to form did the exact opposite.   The American people deserve better.   #SOTU2020,2020-02-05 03:55:14,Twitter for iPhone,18,99
"Rep. Neguse hopes to spotlight gun violence. He’s invited Tom Mauser whose son Daniel was killed in the Columbine school shooting. Neguse has been working on efforts to curb gun violence including passing universal background checks." https://t.co/S89KD9r3v6 via @CPRNews #HR8,2020-02-04 14:46:18,Twitter for iPhone,7,17

"I'll be there wearing my son’s shoes to keep alive the hope that the nation will finally do the right thing addressing this epidemic of gun violence” said Tom Mauser whose son Daniel was killed in the 1999 Columbine shooting.  #HR8 #EnoughIsEnough  https://t.co/qeMwZp95ek,2020-02-02 17:19:38,Twitter for iPhone,9,56
"The precedent this sets is alarming enough: the Senate abandoning its role as the ultimate guard against a dangerous president."   A powerful &amp; devastating @nytimes editorial.  The election this November will truly be the most important in our lifetimes.  https://t.co/XqQRQKFonS,2020-02-02 04:38:40,Twitter for iPhone,24,69
"Give me your tired your poor your huddled masses"   As a son of Eritrean refugees those words mean everything.   The President's travel ban on Eritrea &amp; other African countries is reckless cruel and wrong.   Congress must oppose it. And we will.   https://t.co/e7Ws3Ga5rX,2020-01-31 20:42:33,Twitter for iPhone,2602,10961

A year ago @MichaelBennet and I introduced the #COREAct which would protect 400000 acres of public land and became the first #Colorado statewide wilderness legislation to pass the U.S. House in over a decade.  It's time for the Senate to roll up its  sleeves and get this done! https://t.co/1UY5mhCMvy,2020-01-31 15:00:04,Twitter for iPhone,11,43
"Loveland Mayor Marsh wasn’t sure if anyone would get back to her on the weekend but a representative from Rep. Neguse’s office responded right away . . and helped the constituents get onto a flight back to the U.S." https://t.co/ONxIBTSu0a via @reporterherald #copolitics,2020-01-30 14:34:39,Twitter for iPhone,3,25
In other words as President Nixon stated "when the president does it that means that it is not illegal."   The argument being made by the President's counsel is completely nonsensical.    America deserves a fair trial. Bolton must testify.   #ImpeachmentTrial https://t.co/EyoDyL9ADB,2020-01-29 20:04:09,Twitter for iPhone,16,73

Every day I'm reminded that we stand on the shoulders of true giants like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. who sacrificed so much in the civil rights struggle.    May his message of hope justice and equality be a blessing to us all as we work to honor his memory &amp; legacy.  #MLKJrDay https://t.co/6NcgznegUE,2020-01-20 19:54:51,Twitter for iPhone,5,45
