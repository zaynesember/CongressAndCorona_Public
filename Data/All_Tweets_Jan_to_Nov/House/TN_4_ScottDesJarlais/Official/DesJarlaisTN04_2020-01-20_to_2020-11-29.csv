Mayor Giuliani's work in Ukraine began during Russian Collusion fraud. Ukrainian politicians DID interfere in U.S. election. Russian Collusion Delusion imploded.

Almost impossible to conceive worse strategy than House Democrats in their sham impeachment charade. Insult and threaten the jury. Recycle Russian Collusion Delusion even corrupt Fake News abandoned. Looking forward to seeing some actual professionals take charge.,2020-01-25 18:23:09,Twitter for iPhone,72,310
What Left is really upset about is they’d rather you forget how this whole impeachment charade started. Notice you never hear about partisan whistleblower anymore who coordinated scam with Adam Schiff and lied in legal docs.

We're now on to debating next Article of Impeachment where House Democrats argue the 3rd Branch of government is illegal.   Asking courts to settle disputes between 1st and 2nd branches is not "obstruction of justice." It's the definition of justice.,2020-01-23 18:21:30,TweetDeck,6,16
In impeachment trial House Democrats want to call witnesses but only their own witnesses witnesses they never called during sham investigation. No witnesses for President Trump they argue. To #Resistance this would be a "fair" trial. It's a cover-up!,2020-01-23 14:56:03,TweetDeck,1,3
Spare us! Adam Schiff who perpetrated Russian Collusion Delusion is rehashing his failed fraud on Senate Floor.

More info on the way.,2020-01-23 13:23:55,Twitter for iPhone,9,21
How time flies. A few years ago Obama Admin denied military aid to Ukraine to appease Russia. Where was Mr Schiff? Under Donald Trump we got tough. Supplied weapons. Withdrew from bad nuke deals.

Somehow I don't think Democrats' strategy of insulting Senate Republicans they need to vote for their ridiculous impeachment as treacherous liars will win any over. Another illustration of how badly managed this partisan witch hunt has been from the start. Amateur hour!,2020-01-22 18:37:27,TweetDeck,23,51

Chief Impeacher Adam Schiff asking for "fairness" after submitting joke of impeachment articles to Senate. Fairness would be dismissing them straightaway.   Don't worry Mr. Schiff. You'll always have your commemorative pen.,2020-01-21 18:53:09,TweetDeck,16,60
