This disgusting tweet is just the latest from @DonnaDeegan’s spokesperson. This type of disdain for our men and women in uniform should never be acceptable. I’m wishing a full and speedy recovery to these Guardsmen. https://t.co/XWFQ9yeVM4,2020-06-05 19:41:38,Twitter for iPhone,13,43
Americans will not stand for $80m of taxpayer funds meant to save jobs being used to fund abortions.   Planned Parenthood &amp; the abortion industry are depriving hard working Americans of the relief they deserve &amp; must return these funds immediately.  https://t.co/EMxQugbZVA,2020-05-21 00:19:54,Twitter for iPhone,3,10
