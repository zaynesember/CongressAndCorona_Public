The #BREATHEAct would allow illegal immigrants to vote dismantle ICE and CBP and decriminalize illegal border crossings. It would also make drastic cuts to our military. Is this the Democrat model for national security?,2020-07-09 20:07:41,Twitter Web App,10,9
The #BREATHEAct would allow criminals to vote from prison close federal prisons &amp; abolish life sentencing for even the most violent criminals.

The #BREATHEAct would remove police school resource officers and metal detectors from schools. It would abolish state gang databases and repeal all juvenile offenses. Is this the Democrat model for school safety?,2020-07-09 20:07:40,Twitter Web App,8,5

There is a time for discussing the many other challenges that face our country but not now while Americans are hurting. House leadership must stop playing political games &amp; focus on providing assistance to millions of working families.,2020-03-23 21:36:04,Twitter Web App,23,48
.@SpeakerPelosi is also pushing for a government buyout of commercial aircraft. This is an aviation version of "Cash for Clunkers." What does this have to do with mitigating the damage caused by #COVIDー19? https://t.co/sNDRqeInaf,2020-03-23 21:36:04,Twitter Web App,28,40
.@SpeakerPelosi is slipping in mandatory same-day voter registration for all states. It’s not only for the November election but for “any subsequent election for federal office.” This has NOTHING to do with giving workers relief during the coronavirus outbreak. https://t.co/yFKqyw4oWJ,2020-03-23 21:36:03,Twitter Web App,35,44
.@SpeakerPelosi is using the coronavirus crisis to sneak in elements of the #GreenNewDeal. Our responsibility to American families hurting right now has nothing to do with carbon emissions! https://t.co/pUSnl30HwL,2020-03-23 21:36:03,Twitter Web App,53,57
Senate Democrats once again voted against giving families &amp; small businesses immediate financial relief.
