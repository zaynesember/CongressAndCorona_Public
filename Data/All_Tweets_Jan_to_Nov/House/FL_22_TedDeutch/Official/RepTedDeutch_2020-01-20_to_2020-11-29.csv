Emotionally scarring children by separating families is not taking care of their needs.

The number of cases from the WH Barrett event show importance of following CDC guidance.

Gov DeSantis spent yesterday raving about all the testing in Florida.   Today our state reported over 15000 new cases.   Cases hospitalizations and deaths are all up by over 50% in a week.   Stop talking about what we did in March and start telling us your plan for RIGHT NOW!,2020-07-12 16:10:14,Twitter for iPhone,1539,3904
Governor DeSantis just spent 20 minutes boasting about all the tests in Florida.   Shrugged off the 7-10 day wait to get test results.  Mentioned face masks once.  No plan to make tracing work.

The Governor just hasn’t been straight or transparent with the people of Florida.  We shouldn’t have to fight to get basic information.

343 days ago. The House passed a bipartisan universal background check bill 343 days ago. This bill can save lives. It can help protect 37000 brave FBI employees risking their lives to keep us safe.
