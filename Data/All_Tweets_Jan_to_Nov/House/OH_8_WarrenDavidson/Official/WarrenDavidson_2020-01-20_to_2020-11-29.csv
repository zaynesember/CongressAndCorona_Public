#Ohio #farmers can especially look forward to new trade deals with #China Japan and Korea. China alone will pledge to buy $40-$50 billion in U.S. agriculture products including pork. I am excited to see a prosperous future for our agricultural leaders. #SOTU2020,2020-02-05 02:25:12,Twitter Web App,3,24
#USMCA is a great win for America. Adding 176K jobs and nearly $62 billion to the economy wages are on the rise. We are putting American workers first. #SOTU2020,2020-02-05 02:24:26,Twitter Web App,5,14

.@RealDonaldTrump’s guest Mr. Raskins is an inspiration to us all. Not only did he serve the #Army in Afghanistan but he also overcame #addiction and #incarceration. Thank you for your service and being a role model for us all. #OhioProud #SOTU2020,2020-02-05 02:20:40,Twitter Web App,20,65
Opportunity zones provide tax benefits for business to foster growth in disadvantaged areas. #Ohio currently has 320 opportunity zones in 73 counties.

The war hawks are wrong: more wars in more places does not make America more secure. Defense hawks should insist on a focused combat ready force equipped to respond swiftly via @POTUS to any attack / imminent threat AND insist that Congress votes when USA commits to long wars. https://t.co/xAylshTuTd,2020-01-30 17:01:11,Twitter Web App,12,40
It was great to see Ohio Senate President @LarryObhof today at the White House to witness @realDonaldTrump signing #USMCA. This is a great win for Ohio’s workers farmers businesses and economy.

What @SpeakerPelosi intends for evil may God use for good. It’s time for #DeedsNotWords to end the endless wars. As you said earlier today I will vote YES from my heart to end the outdated AUMF in Iraq and for the rational position that the 2001 AUMF targeting Al Qaeda ≠ Iran. https://t.co/q2NuJNnDDD,2020-01-30 02:00:06,Twitter for iPhone,17,33
