Calls for austerity now make no economic sense. In a low inflation low interest rate environment it’s better to spend to prevent mass unemployment which would fuel further deficits.

*To clarify the Fed owned 13% of US public debt in 2019 more than any other entity and more than the 30% China and all other foreign governments own.

2/ Most start-ups have &lt;500 employees but in many cases the SBA counts all the start-ups backed by one venture capital firm as one business.   Each start-up with &lt;500 employees should be counted as their own small business just like small businesses in other sectors.,2020-03-28 15:56:13,Twitter Web App,6,37
