I stand firmly with those in NEPA and across the U.S. protesting in a non-violent way as our entire federal government should. The opportunists that have turned to violence must stop. It only detracts from the legitimate and peaceful protests. 2/4,2020-06-03 00:24:04,Twitter Web App,1,17
THREAD: Using rubber bullets &amp; tear gas against US citizens demonstrating peacefully is just as unacceptable as violent and destructive rioting.
