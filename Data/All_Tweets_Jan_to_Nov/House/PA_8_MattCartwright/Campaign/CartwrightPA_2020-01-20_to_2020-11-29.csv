3 years ago this week: John McCain voted "no" on repealing the Affordable Care Act &amp; protections for pre-existing conditions.

Closing the pay gap at the Tobyhanna Army Depot has been a longtime priority of mine and I'm proud that my fix has finally cleared the House!

A program that's helping clean up NEPA’s abandoned mines &amp; supporting good local jobs will expire next year if Congress doesn’t act. My bipartisan bills to keep it going have cleared the House and I'll keep fighting to get them signed into law. https://t.co/KwmBVuiJ9X,2020-07-22 19:37:56,Twitter Web App,0,2
Some relief initiatives for working families struggling during #COVID19 will end in a matter of days including foreclosure protections &amp; enhanced unemployment insurance. But NEPA families are still struggling. They must be extended in the next bill. https://t.co/5jYc9xelig,2020-07-21 22:23:48,Twitter Web App,0,1
At a time when cases are surging and testing is backlogged we can’t afford to let up in our fight against #COVID19. This shouldn’t be a partisan issue. I’ll keep pushing for more federal resources to get us through this crisis &amp; move our economy forward. https://t.co/VNmhhzl5xS https://t.co/ZiNnYTZyGH,2020-07-20 19:03:54,Twitter Web App,1,2

We can’t sit by when innocent lives are lost &amp; families are torn apart by gun violence. Commonsense reforms like expanded background checks and closing loopholes can help save lives.

My opponent on health care: calls Obamacare a "disaster" sits by silently as his GOP tries to dismantle it in court -- the very law that protects people with pre-existing conditions and expanded care for PA families &amp; seniors.  Meet the real Jim Bognet. https://t.co/MN5aA8jBxA,2020-07-16 17:45:00,Twitter Web App,27,31
During #COVID19 I’m fighting for relief for American families and small businesses and to make our drugs here in the U.S. – not China. But Jim Bognet? He’d take us backwards and take away health care for millions.   Let’s move America forward. #PA08 https://t.co/w41osWoa6F,2020-07-15 20:45:00,Twitter Web App,4,7
Our health care workers are telling us that #PPE supplies are running low. This is why it’s important that we take steps now to increase our capacity to produce medical equipment &amp; drugs in the US while also ending our reliance on Chinese drug companies. https://t.co/UbYSJtEgeJ,2020-07-14 21:00:01,Twitter Web App,1,2
#COVID19 has left millions without health insurance. 4 out of 5 are still eligible for coverage because of the #ACA yet the GOP is *still* trying to scrap it!  It's simple: they want to take away your care but I'm fighting to protect it &amp; lower costs. https://t.co/zYGYvKZsXq,2020-07-14 17:00:00,Twitter Web App,0,2

.@JoeBiden’s Build Back Better plan would follow through on a commitment to build our future in America and create American jobs. #COVID19 has taught us that making medicines in the US and reducing our dependence on China has to be a part of this too. https://t.co/G8JPe3BWG2,2020-07-11 21:44:03,Twitter Web App,1,3

The GOP went ahead today with their courtroom assault on the #ACA – a move that could strip health care from nearly 1M Pennsylvanians. Instead of dismantling our health care system during a global pandemic we should be working to expand coverage and lower the cost of care. https://t.co/8l7vfpuO7u,2020-06-26 00:08:23,Twitter Web App,2,3
It's never been more critical to ensure hardworking families across the US can get quality health care.
