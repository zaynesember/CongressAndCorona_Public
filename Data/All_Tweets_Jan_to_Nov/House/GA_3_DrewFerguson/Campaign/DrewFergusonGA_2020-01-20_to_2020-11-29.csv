Happy Thanksgiving! This year has been full of uncertainty struggle &amp; unrest for all Americans.

I’m looking forward to getting back out and campaigning for @Perduesenate  and @KLoeffler. There’s still a lot of work to be done—we are making sure every legal vote is counted and every illegal vote is not. This is a real fight we need to stay engaged &amp; WIN! #GA03 #TeamFerguson https://t.co/eWOx8Gkecl,2020-11-06 17:18:29,Sprout Social,0,10
Every legally cast vote should be counted. Votes cast illegally should not be. Anyone who is found to have maliciously violated the law should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. #gapol,2020-11-06 15:10:53,Twitter Web App,1,4
I believe we need to institute much tighter controls &amp; oversight of future elections. I believe local officials should oversee elections but also believe stronger standards from the state are needed to make sure we once again have confidence in our right to free &amp; fair elections.,2020-11-06 15:10:53,Twitter Web App,0,5
I believe there needs to be a top-down investigation of the way this election was conducted in Georgia and in the other states where ballots have been randomly appearing in just the right numbers to swing elections.,2020-11-06 15:10:52,Twitter Web App,0,0
This must be cured. Not because I want one candidate to win but because we cannot move forward as a supposedly free nation with this dark stain spreading over our electoral process.,2020-11-06 15:10:52,Twitter Web App,0,0
This is a dark moment in America’s storied history. Our confidence—the world’s confidence—in our most sacred and fundamental right has been shaken. If the right of Americans to choose their leaders has been stolen from them everything about America stands on trembling ground.,2020-11-06 15:10:52,Twitter Web App,0,3
I'm proud to support @KLoeffler for U.S. Senate in the January runoff election. #TeamFerguson is all in! Let's keep Georgia RED.,2020-11-04 15:30:33,Twitter Web App,2,20

Yesterday was a great day for our community—we proved to Joe Biden that GA is NOT for sale!

The future of America is on the line. Now more than ever we must elect strong Republican leaders like @GoodForCongress who will fight for our shared conservative values in Washington.

My friend @Perduesenate drew a stark contrast to Jon Ossoff in yesterday’s debate. Was like watching the Dawgs beat TN!,2020-10-13 11:59:12,Sprout Social,0,4
Today we reflect on the important lessons learned on one of the darkest days in our history. When our nation was brutally attacked by Islamic terrorism we came together in solidarity more resilient than ever. May we never forget our first responders for their valor &amp; dedication. https://t.co/1WZ3RU64ox,2020-09-11 19:44:29,Sprout Social,0,0

I'm deeply saddened by the passing of my good friend and mentor Herman Cain. He was a stalwart defender of conservative ideals and values — his loss will be felt for years to come. My thoughts and prayers are with his family during this time. https://t.co/9z32F4IxWE,2020-07-30 22:12:22,Sprout Social,2,3

I’m proud to have the endorsement of the @USChamber in my reelection to the U.S. House of Representatives. In Congress I'll continue advocating for pro-business initiatives that advance economic growth help create jobs and promote fiscal responsibility for every Georgian. #GA03 https://t.co/Yozo3mV6al,2020-07-14 21:34:05,Sprout Social,0,3

As we've watched American businesses meltdown &amp; lose everything they've worked for an unexpected hero has risen to the challenge: our community bankers who are working to rebuild our economy &amp; the American Dream.

Playing partisan politics during a time like this is unacceptable. We are working to FIX this crisis and will NOT be derailed by the senseless political games of the radical left. Save it Madam Speaker. https://t.co/aiVR0Dig0q,2020-03-25 16:37:49,Twitter Web App,1,0
Nancy Pelosi &amp; her pack of socialist cronies clearly believe in the saying “Never let a serious crisis go to waste.” While our nation longs for certainty in unity during such uncertain times Nancy Pelosi is busy driving a wedge between Americans for the benefit of her select few,2020-03-25 16:37:49,Twitter Web App,0,3
The Trump Administration is proving again and again that they are serious about KEEPING AMERICA GREAT! This latest jobs report proves that conservative policies WORK and socialist policies will only continue to hurt American jobs and industry. #gapol https://t.co/N4oF3pnMLW,2020-02-07 18:39:31,Sprout Social,11,10
The media is willing to stand up and call out Joe Biden and his son Hunter for their corruption cover-up in Ukraine. Joe Biden barks at reporters because he knows that what him and his son did was wrong and was a gross unethical use of his position as VP https://t.co/c12UINYAaH,2020-02-04 00:42:08,Sprout Social,0,0
