Any future negotiated settlement supported by the U.S. must ensure the people of Artsakh can reconstruct their communities and rebuild their lives without fear of further bloodshed.

The ceasefire signed earlier this week regarding Nagorno Karabakh isn't a long-term peace settlement.

Rachel Kyte is right. We can rebuild America with a strong 21st century clean economy. That’s why my #CLEANFuture Act treats the #ClimateCrisis like the emergency it is and puts America on the path to net-zero greenhouse gas pollution. https://t.co/d5DqNjJt68,2020-08-26 18:17:49,Twitter Web App,2,4
The House passed the John Lewis Voting Rights Act to combat Trump’s assault on voting rights across America. Now is the time to restore voting rights.   The Senate must act. https://t.co/cOWDBTwrZv,2020-08-26 17:19:14,Twitter Web App,5,11
Acting on Trump’s behalf Secretary Pompeo has successfully politicized our foreign policy weakened America’s global standing strained relations with our allies and empowered authoritarian leaders. https://t.co/q6rZKntqdJ,2020-08-26 16:40:26,Twitter Web App,7,19

We need to hold polluters accountable — the damage they inflict is expensive to fix. The House-passed Moving Forward Act invests billions in making sure our homes roads sea walls and ports are resilient to a changing climate.

In a clear rebuff of Trump and his efforts to kill mail-in voting amid a public health crisis this is welcome news for our democracy.

For 85 years #SocialSecurity has given millions of Americans economic security but Trump’s ridiculous executive order would defund it.

The House passed the #HeroesAct 13 weeks ago. Since then 3.8 million Americans have contracted #COVID19 and 80000 have died.   It doesn’t have to be this way.   We need a national testing and contact tracing plan NOW.,2020-08-14 15:31:14,Twitter Web App,8,18

Trump has ceded American leadership in the Mediterranean to the thuggish regime of President Erdogan.   His failure to push back against Turkish acts of aggression in the region has led to significant confrontations between them and our real NATO allies. https://t.co/u1FoIE5Hw8,2020-08-13 22:52:44,Twitter Web App,27,24

Today’s action by @EPA to gut commonsense methane requirements for the oil and gas sector defies both science and human decency.

I am deeply concerned by the announcement that the Trump Administration plans to end 100 percent federal cost-share for National Guard units in most states.

We were right to be concerned. Weeks after the Trump Admin changed how hospitals report #COVID19 data bypassing CDC it appears that the public release of key data has "slowed to a crawl" with some data such as bed counts lagging by a week or more. https://t.co/5eSCOVgkI7,2020-08-12 23:00:00,Twitter Web App,7,9

The federal law makes #COVID19 testing free for all but clearly there are still gaps.    My Committee has passed legislation outlawing surprise billing.

These actions are blatant attempts to work the refs so that Trump can spread disinformation on his social media platforms about the election and #COVID19. Platforms should not be bullied into letting misinformation go unchecked. https://t.co/VVQLJwZSXD,2020-08-03 22:08:58,Twitter Web App,3,4

The #COVID19 pandemic requires real leadership from the Republican Senate.

The Trump Admin is required to submit to Congress a comprehensive report on COVID-19 health disparities but unfortunately their response has been inadequate. The #HeroesAct would also require the Admin to develop a national testing strategy to help reduce testing disparities.,2020-08-01 15:48:24,Twitter Web App,3,4

If Trump was serious about significantly lowering prescription drug costs he would work with Democrats to get HR 3 signed into law.
