Choosing between pandemic prevention and food for your family is an impossible choice which no one should be asked to make.

As an officer I really cared about who my backup was and if they were up to the task.  @RepSylviaGarcia and @RepZoeLofgren are my backup—and they're up to the task. https://t.co/y5E4FyEHJo,2020-01-24 14:34:25,Twitter Web App,322,1526

No constitution can protect us if Right doesn't matter any more.  And you know: you can't trust this president to do what's right for this country.  You can trust he will do what's right for Donald Trump.  -@RepAdamSchiff https://t.co/47OKxkTaxK https://t.co/s333SmZaUF,2020-01-24 04:03:39,Twitter Web App,1766,5547
Long County Deputy Sheriff Sheldon Gordon Whiteman lost his life this evening in the line of duty. He was only 44 years old. My heart and prayers go out to his children family and community. Please think of them tonight. https://t.co/ABXIbiPXBU,2020-01-24 03:54:57,Twitter Web App,38,249
Why did President Trump remove a highly decorated foreign service officer? An anti-corruption crusader?  Because she was in the way of bogus investigations that would help him cheat in the 2020 elections. https://t.co/J8UilrvSmr,2020-01-24 03:54:25,Twitter Web App,700,2104
Withholding security assistance to Ukraine made the original abuse of power (soliciting foreign interference in our elections) that much worse.  But it was also itself an abuse of power. And not only that...  It also violated the law. It was illegal. https://t.co/y9NFdt2gku,2020-01-24 03:51:14,Twitter Web App,221,765
This is what it is all about.  This is the cardinal sin.  That when it came down to choosing between the national interest of the country and his personal interest President Trump chose himself. https://t.co/dHS7BG27Zz,2020-01-24 03:48:49,Twitter Web App,487,1755
This moment is about the American people. This is about ensuring that EVERY voter—whether a maid or janitor a nurse teacher truck driver doctor or mechanic—that their vote matters.   That American elections are decided by the AMERICAN people. https://t.co/dHS7BG27Zz,2020-01-24 03:48:20,Twitter Web App,285,1122
Right matters. And the truth matters. Otherwise we are lost. -@RepAdamSchiff,2020-01-24 03:34:05,Twitter Web App,4866,22418

Last night eight people were shot one killed in Seattle.  Gun violence is a scourge on our communities.  We are not powerless. We do not lack solutions. The right course of action is clear: keep guns out of the wrong hands. #SeattleShooting #EndGunViolence,2020-01-23 13:58:50,Twitter for iPhone,378,1510
Vera Matteman was murdered in Auschwitz. She was five. Over a million people mostly Jewish were killed in the camp.

We know these materials exist. We know they are relevant. And we know the President is desperately trying to conceal them. https://t.co/fOrUxQGQpM,2020-01-23 02:45:40,Twitter Web App,2418,8216
I am hoping that every Senator will remember the oath that they have taken and take it very seriously.  The American people deserve to see a fair trial and we are going to do everything on our side to make sure they get one.  Thank you to @TheView for having me on this morning! https://t.co/YdiFeKjXuY,2020-01-22 18:16:06,Twitter Media Studio,448,1957

The second article of impeachment was for obstruction of Congress: covering up witnesses and documents from the American people.  This morning the President not only confessed to it he bragged about it:   "Honestly we have all the material. They don't have the material." https://t.co/DPAEFHIDjS,2020-01-22 16:17:41,Twitter for iPhone,40399,96453

47 years after #RoevWade we must redouble our resistance against attempts to take us backwards.  Women's health is not negotiable. Women's bodies belong to no one but themselves.,2020-01-22 14:20:17,Twitter Web App,1835,6830
As a career law enforcement officer I have never seen anyone take such extreme steps to hide evidence allegedly providing his 'innocence.'  The President is engaged in this cover up because he is guilty and he knows it. https://t.co/8YnTT8TNxN,2020-01-22 01:01:43,Twitter Web App,4612,14572
President Trump’s lengthy trial brief does not explain why even now he has not offered any documents or witnesses in his defense or provided any information in response to the House’s repeated requests. This is not how an innocent person behaves.,2020-01-21 17:38:23,Twitter Web App,335,1192
President Trump’s lengthy brief to the Senate is heavy on rhetoric and procedural grievances but entirely lacks a legitimate defense of his misconduct. It is clear from his response that President Trump would rather discuss anything other than what he actually did.,2020-01-21 17:38:12,Twitter Web App,1517,5160
If the Senate does not convict and remove President Trump he will have succeeded in placing himself above the law. Each Senator should set aside partisanship and politics and hold President Trump accountable to protect our national security and democracy.,2020-01-21 17:38:03,Twitter Web App,210,674
President Trump’s view that he cannot be held accountable except in an election he seeks to fix in his favor underscores the need for the Senate to exercise its solemn constitutional duty to remove President Trump from office.,2020-01-21 17:38:03,Twitter Web App,165,548
Indeed on the eve of his impeachment trial President Trump continues to insist that he has done nothing wrong.,2020-01-21 17:38:03,Twitter Web App,80,314
The ultimate check on Presidential misconduct was provided by the Framers through the power to impeach and remove a President—a power that the Framers vested in the representatives of the American people.,2020-01-21 17:38:03,Twitter Web App,103,357
The Framers also knew that periodic democratic elections cannot serve as an effective check on a President who seeks to manipulate the those elections.,2020-01-21 17:38:02,Twitter Web App,101,358
The Framers anticipated that a President might one day seek to place his own personal and political interests above those of our Nation and they understood that foreign interference in our elections was one of the gravest threats to our democracy.,2020-01-21 17:38:02,Twitter Web App,947,2921
There should be a fair trial — fair to the President yes but equally important fair to the American people. Any Senator who wants the same should reject the McConnell Resolution. https://t.co/KVDukoTEA7,2020-01-21 13:34:07,Twitter Web App,530,1682
A White House-driven and rigged process with a truncated schedule designed to go late into the night and further conceal the President’s misconduct is not what the American people expect or deserve.,2020-01-21 13:34:07,Twitter Web App,400,1471
The McConnell Resolution goes so far as to suggest it may not even allow the evidence gathered by the House to be admitted. That is not a fair trial. In fact it is no trial at all.,2020-01-21 13:34:06,Twitter Web App,417,1379
If those efforts are successful this will be the first impeachment trial in American history in which the Senate did not allow the House to present its case with witnesses and documents.,2020-01-21 13:34:06,Twitter Web App,350,1202
...Here McConnell is trying to prevent the witnesses from ever testifying and the public from ever finding out what they have to say.,2020-01-21 13:34:06,Twitter Web App,348,1250
And in the Clinton case all of the witnesses had testified before the Senate trial began and the only issue was whether they would be re-called to testify once more. The substance of what they would say was already known...,2020-01-21 13:34:06,Twitter Web App,293,1162
In the Clinton case the President provided all of the documents — more than 90000 pages of them — before the trial took place. McConnell’s resolution rejects that basic necessity.,2020-01-21 13:34:06,Twitter Web App,363,1280
His resolution deviates sharply from the Clinton precedent — and common sense — in an effort to prevent the full truth of the President’s misconduct from coming to light.,2020-01-21 13:34:06,Twitter Web App,398,1394
For weeks Mitch McConnell has asserted that he planned to follow the ‘Clinton precedent’ for structuring President Trump’s Senate impeachment trial. It is now clear why he hid his proposed resolution all this time and released it the night before the trial is set to begin.,2020-01-21 13:34:05,Twitter Web App,2861,7853
President Trump maintains that the Senate cannot remove him even if the House proves every claim in the Articles of impeachment. That is a chilling assertion. It is also dead wrong.,2020-01-20 22:58:02,Twitter for iPhone,7258,30352
The American Legion Dorie Miller Memorial Post 331 in West Orlando was named after Dorie Miller. My office joined them for a wreath laying ceremony on National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day last December.  May he continue to inspire us for generations to come. https://t.co/zPXCNfwcgC,2020-01-20 16:18:40,Twitter Web App,60,342
But during the surprise attack that morning he leaped to man an anti-aircraft gun and saved countless lives by carrying wounded sailors to safety as the ship was struck by torpedoes and bombs. His bravery earned him the Navy Cross never before given to a Black sailor.,2020-01-20 16:18:39,Twitter Web App,60,326
On December 7 1941 a young Navy mess attendant named Doris 'Dorie' Miller was serving aboard the USS West Virginia docked in Pearl Harbor.  As a Black sailor his job was to swab decks cook and do other menial work.,2020-01-20 16:18:39,Twitter Web App,24,132
I'm pleased to hear that the U.S. Navy will be naming an aircraft carrier after Doris 'Dorie' Miller the first time a ship of this type will be named after an African American sailor. Here's his story: https://t.co/QVtQVyVVPs,2020-01-20 16:18:38,Twitter Web App,413,1702
