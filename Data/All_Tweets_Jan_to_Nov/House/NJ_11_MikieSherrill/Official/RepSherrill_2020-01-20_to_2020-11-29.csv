Patrick shouldn’t have had to fight the VA for care. And neither should any of our veterans. It’s time to pass H.R. 8261 and ensure that we uphold our commitment to our service members.,2020-11-11 22:48:35,Twitter Web App,3,40
I’m thinking of the tragic loss of New Jersey's Patrick Duva who died last week.  “His family said VA medical staff told Duva that his cancer was related to the toxic exposure he experienced during his military service but VA ‘wouldn't document it.’”  https://t.co/NB94y6IbMi,2020-11-11 22:48:02,Twitter Web App,9,32
That’s why I’m proud to co-sponsor @RepRaulRuizMD’s bill H.R. 8261 the Presumptive Benefits for War Fights Exposed to Burn Pits &amp; Other Toxins Act which would strengthen benefits for veterans suffering from burn pit related illnesses and est. presumption for overseas service.,2020-11-11 22:47:26,Twitter Web App,0,7
But that still leaves an important issue unresolved: presumption. Just like with the 9/11 VCF we need to ensure that any veteran who developed these health issues and served near burn pits is guaranteed care.,2020-11-11 22:46:30,Twitter Web App,0,10
