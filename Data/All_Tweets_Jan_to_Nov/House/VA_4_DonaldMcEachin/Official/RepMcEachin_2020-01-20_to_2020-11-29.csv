We must also examine the social disparities that disproportionately affect Black men and boys in America. In 2019 Black people made up 24% of the police killings in the U.S. and were 3x more likely to be killed by police than compared to White people. #BlackLivesMatter,2020-06-03 18:26:00,TweetDeck,3,8
