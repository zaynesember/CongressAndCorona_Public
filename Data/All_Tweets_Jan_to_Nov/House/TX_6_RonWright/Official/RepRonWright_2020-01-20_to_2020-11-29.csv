2/2: This past summer I teamed up @RepColinAllred to encourage @DeptVetAffairs to acquire a recently closed hospital in Garland that would expand the Department's ability to provide care to an additional 184000 veterans that are proud to call North Texas home. https://t.co/PMqLoQokIi,2020-01-31 18:06:56,Twitter Web App,0,2
1/2: North Texas is one of the fastest-growing regions in the country for veterans and it is great to see @VANorthTexas implementing new technology to help with PTSD.

I just voted NO on two amendments that tie @POTUS's hands to defend Americans abroad.   This messaging stunt by House Dems (with no debate in @HouseForeignGOP) only increases the threat from Iran and the rest of the Middle East putting American lives at risk.,2020-01-30 17:50:49,Twitter for iPhone,16,45
Protecting the unborn is something we hold dear to our hearts in TX and I am thrilled that Ellis County is the first county in TX to become a sanctuary for life.

Democrats are stuck on the impeachment train to nowhere and don't know how to get off.   As we start the 1st day of questions let's not forget the facts:  → No quid pro quo → Trump &amp; Zelensky confirmed no quid pro quo → Ukraine did nothing to receive aid → Aid was released,2020-01-29 18:22:09,Twitter Web App,9,30
President Trump just signed #USMCA into law delivering on his promise to ranchers farmers and manufacturers across the country.   ✅ $68b in added economic growth ✅ 176000 new jobs ✅ Agriculture market expansion ✅ 43000 new manufacturing jobs,2020-01-29 16:53:32,Twitter for iPhone,2,8
House Democrats are really sneaking matters of war and peace in a Gold Medal Bill with no debate--an unprecedented abuse of power.  Playing political games with @POTUS's ability to protect Americans at home and abroad is shameful.  Every American should be outraged by this. https://t.co/bJ02gpafs0,2020-01-28 19:08:46,Twitter Web App,10,29

As the Senate Trial begins today let's look back on the Dems' "solemn" and "somber" House impeachment.   Imagine if Dems put as much effort into solving the issues facing the American people as they do towards impeachment? Who knows what Congress might accomplish. https://t.co/b2pwxDK8Et,2020-01-21 21:03:20,Twitter Web App,8411,23532
