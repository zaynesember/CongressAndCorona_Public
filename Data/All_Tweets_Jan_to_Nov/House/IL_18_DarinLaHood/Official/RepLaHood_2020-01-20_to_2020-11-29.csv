It was a pleasure to join the Frontiers International Club in Springfield today for their annual Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Breakfast. Great to see such a strong showing to celebrate #MLKDay and support the Frontiers’ motto of ’Advancement Through Service.’ https://t.co/vOGdL9LhLr,2020-01-20 19:23:07,Twitter for iPhone,2,7
Today we honor and celebrate the life of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. As we pause to reflect on his profound legacy may we always remember his tireless fight for opportunity equality and justice for all. #MLKDay https://t.co/Dl0umR8MqU,2020-01-20 14:53:28,Twitter for iPhone,6,22
