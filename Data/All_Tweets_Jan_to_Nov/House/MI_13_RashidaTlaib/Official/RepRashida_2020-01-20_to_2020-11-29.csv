This Black Friday it’s about time we #MakeAmazonPay. I stand with millions of workers activists and citizens of the world rising up to demand worker labor and environmental justice from Jeff Bezos. Join us at https://t.co/IkCflYmJns.,2020-11-27 14:56:28,Twitter for iPhone,408,1339
#MakeAmazonPay is about accountability.   .@RepDebDingell and I visited the Amazon DTW1 facility in Romulus and instead of letting us in right away they called the police. We’ve heard from workers who are terrified to come in to work because of safety conditions. https://t.co/j3RRDVq8kF,2020-11-27 02:53:00,Twitter for iPhone,131,403
This Black Friday shop local and  small businesses.   Visit https://t.co/IkCflYmJns to join this movement to hold Amazon accountable to people and the planet.  @ProgIntl https://t.co/LKjhS5aiuX,2020-11-27 01:46:12,Twitter for iPhone,98,424
From the #TeamTlaib family to yours happy #Thanksgiving #13thDistrictStrong. https://t.co/TxhDOXxInb,2020-11-26 14:00:02,Twitter Web App,12,174
Tune in below to hear me discuss what I'm fighting for for #13thDistrictStrong and communities like it including recurring monthly #COVID19 relief payments our expanding #squad and more on the latest episode of @ourbodypolitic. #ICYMI https://t.co/7YD8JGoTDH,2020-11-25 17:00:01,Twitter Web App,6,45
It's almost Turkey Day #13thDistrictStrong! Safety is especially important this year so here are some tips to safely store prep and clean up your main course. #FoodSafeThanksgiving https://t.co/K5wGTMKUXn,2020-11-24 22:00:00,Twitter Web App,10,63
MUST READ: @ProjectSouth's Azadeh Shahshahani and @pennlaw's Sarah Paoletti say the time has come for @DHSgov and @ICEgov to have their reckoning—and I couldn't agree more. #AbolishICE https://t.co/n6FyBFYTHx,2020-11-24 17:00:00,Twitter Web App,36,122
Now more than ever with the #COVID19 pandemic worsening and winter moving in water shutoffs could be deadly. I’m proud to work with groups like @foodandwater to guarantee #waterisahumanright ban water shutoffs nationwide and save lives.,2020-11-23 20:01:19,Twitter for iPhone,18,97
Their letter despicable—and full of falsehoods. Hundreds of shutoff moratoria have expired since March and less than half the country is now protected from them. Only five states have comprehensive bans in effect now. https://t.co/SPRQN3WhMn,2020-11-23 20:01:19,Twitter for iPhone,17,89
This is the greed we're up against in this fight: water utilities lobbyists sent to @SpeakerPelosi &amp; @senatemajldr seeking to maintain their ability to shut off water to low-income families during this pandemic. We must put people before profits. https://t.co/fQdTRVSfm5,2020-11-23 20:01:19,Twitter for iPhone,15,59
This is just one example of why a *federal* moratorium on water shutoffs is desperately needed: our governor's critical leadership on banning water shutoffs was struck down by conservative judges. We must make #waterisahumanright the law of the land. https://t.co/jDtaom15qa,2020-11-23 20:01:12,Twitter for iPhone,16,65
Worse than their callous response to 120+ orgs demanding a national water shutoff moratorium the Trump #CDC has also blown off responding to my @OversightDems colleagues &amp; I on this issue too. Lives are on the line. Our government must—at every level—ensure #waterisahumanright. https://t.co/IToi80sptM,2020-11-23 20:01:11,Twitter for iPhone,16,55
Trump @CDCGov: Wash your hands w/clean water to protect against #COVID19.   Millions of people: Our water’s shut off and we don’t have clean water.   CDC: Buy gallons of hand sanitizer—or maybe just use contaminated water.   This CDC letter is an outrage. https://t.co/zpgsjpQl7N,2020-11-23 20:01:02,Twitter for iPhone,130,304
#TeamTlaib helped spread the #Thanksgiving spirit over the weekend at a turkey giveaway at the Commonwealth of Faith Church in #Redford.

The #RISEAct has been endorsed by over ten environmental justice organizations including @SierraClub @StopMoneyPipe and @ThisIsZeroHour. I look forward to working with them and @SenJeffMerkley to build momentum around this legislation and see it made into law.,2020-11-20 21:06:29,Twitter Web App,18,76
Federal employees who've honorably dedicated themselves to public service deserve to have the option of divesting from corporate polluters that we have seen callously engage in public disservice time and again endangering the lives of people and our planet in the name of profit.,2020-11-20 21:06:28,Twitter Web App,13,86
NEW: I introduced the House version of @SenJeffMerkley's #RISEAct today. Other countries governments central banks universities and companies around the world meanwhile have recognized the need to rapidly divest from fossil fuel assets. We must too. https://t.co/wvvmS50eTt,2020-11-20 21:06:28,Twitter Web App,51,191
Thanks to @SenStabenow @SenGaryPeters @RepDebDingell @RepLawrence and @RepAndyLevin for joining in the call for an accurate count. #13DistrictStrong and all who call Michigan home deserve to be counted and funded accordingly. https://t.co/z4telmsnkK,2020-11-20 16:42:05,Twitter for iPhone,15,69
This letter is just one avenue I will pursue to ensure the Trump @uscensusbureau is held accountable for their haphazard handling of the #2020Census that will severely cost our residents long after their reign of incompetence is over. https://t.co/w8GZds5SQy,2020-11-20 16:42:05,Twitter for iPhone,35,218
The challenges we face today—inequality racism climate change and more—are interlocking. Our response must be too. That’s why I stand with the frontline leaders occupying the DNC today.

WATCH: It’s an outrage that the Senate #GOP and impeached President's administration are more focused on undermining our democracy than on delivering #COVID19 relief to the millions of Americans struggling. We need urgent action on stimulus payments and water shutoffs NOW. https://t.co/cgxBg3wRRg,2020-11-19 19:27:00,Twitter for iPhone,175,750
People in the community surrounding the Ambassador Bridge have spoken: protect our public health and environment and reject Bridge Co's dangerous hazmat ploy.  We must listen to them not corporations. https://t.co/eFBahtZJaD,2020-11-19 16:21:58,Twitter Web App,12,93
#ICYMI: In the country’s largest majority-Black city the #BlackLivesMatter movement should not be met with city leaders’ efforts to suppress anyone’s First Amendment rights.

Thank you for your partnership on this @repcleaver!  Federal workers don't deserve to be set up to fail by being forced to invest their hard-earned savings in corporate polluters that endanger our public health. #RESPONDAct is much-needed legislation to protect them from that. https://t.co/uKKooh0gYW,2020-11-17 21:48:50,Twitter Web App,24,118

REMINDER: Even though Trump's racist henchman Stephen Miller will soon be out of the White House the need for an impartial int'l investigation into atrocities committed by @DHSgov remains.

In the wake of the #COVID19 pandemic @USOCC should focus on increasing access to financial services for the unbanked and underbanked not for companies like Amazon and Facebook. @RepStephenLynch and I led led a letter to them about this.

@RepAOC @Ilhan @RepPressley and I led a letter to @ohchr @UNHumanRights &amp; @OAS_official to call for an investigation into @DHSgov’s human rights violations.

The #PublicBanking Act has the support of nine of our House colleagues and 29 organizations that have been on the frontlines of the fight for #FairBanking4All. Here's just one example of #WhyPublicBanks are needed to address economic and racial inequality in our banking system: https://t.co/OgAzZiK9S8,2020-10-30 14:42:22,Twitter Web App,28,93
The #PublicBanking Act would provide a much-needed financial lifeline to states and municipalities as well as unbanked and underbanked residents left in dire straits by the #COVID19 pandemic especially communities of color like #13thDistrictStrong. https://t.co/OmSfRCQ3KF,2020-10-30 14:42:21,Twitter Web App,20,97
Big banks have been are and will continue to depend on the public dollar. It's time for an option that works for the people and not solely privatized profits. That's why I partnered with @RepAOC to introduce the #PublicBanking Act. #FairBanking4All https://t.co/IaRL1g2gZH,2020-10-30 14:42:21,Twitter Web App,45,183
This is just my latest effort to secure our states and municipalities the #COVID19 relief funding they need from the @federalreserve. I previously introduced the Uplifting Our Local Communities Act which would expand their access to #CARESAct funding.  https://t.co/2g5IiRhhrI,2020-10-29 21:05:07,Twitter for iPhone,18,47
Along with @RealBankReform I'm urging the @federalreserve to support our cities and municipalities struggling in wake of #COVID19 pandemic not corporate polluters like @MarathonPetroCo—with 15 MI emission limit violations since 2013.

Thanks to @RepDebHaaland and @RepJoeKennedy for cosponsoring this legislation that meets the injustices of today with the spirit of the #CivilRights warriors who came before us. And special thanks to @NLGnews for endorsing it. It's time for #JusticeforAll.,2020-10-28 15:59:49,Twitter for iPhone,8,52
With a new conservative fundamentalist #SCOTUS majority the #JusticeforAll Act is the legislation we need to ensure we're empowered to push back against decades more of conservative court rulings undermining our #civilrights laws. https://t.co/JoeT0sACzt,2020-10-28 15:59:48,Twitter for iPhone,9,49
Expanded protections. Stronger #CivilRights. A more inclusive America. That is what my #JusticeforAll Act makes possible.

Holding @DHSgov accountable for its long history of abuses is a human rights reproductive justice and public health imperative—one that has been put on the backburner at the expense and detriment of our immigrant neighbors. #AbolishICE https://t.co/lsThQ8aQtq,2020-10-23 18:57:30,Twitter Web App,72,318

Here's just one reason why the historic passage of the #EmmettTill Antilynching Act is so important: Of all the lynchings that were committed after 1900 only 1% of all perpetrators were convicted of murder.  https://t.co/wfFOkXjA3G,2020-02-26 21:15:45,Twitter Web App,42,112
