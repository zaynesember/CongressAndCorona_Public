80 plus members of Congress joined me @RepDebDingell &amp; @RepDanKildee in urging water shutoff relief for people (not businesses as proposed by the Senate).

Dear Senators Our residents needed help weeks ago so to settle for a one-time payment rather than recurring payments leaves our neighbors too vulnerable in this uncertain times. We must be more aggressive and help people monthly until this crisis ends. #MintTheCoin,2020-03-25 17:48:10,Twitter for Android,570,2072
Communities across the country like mine in #13DistrictStrong need to access masks tests &amp; yes WATER! They need to be able to wash their hands to protect themselves from #COVID-19. That is why we all need to push Congress to include water shutoff relief in any final bill.,2020-03-25 17:33:49,Twitter for Android,79,368
.@senatemajldr your priorities are clear.   You don't care about people especially poor or working class folks. To include water shutoff relief for businesses but then leave out families who don't have access to water right now is INHUMANE.

I am so angry right now. The Senate sent over a bill that has no direct help for water shutoff.  Just like masks washing your hands prevents the spread #COVID19.   They had relief for businesses for water shutoff but not poor people. The priorities of our Senate is shameful.,2020-03-25 17:14:33,Twitter Web App,5874,28490
