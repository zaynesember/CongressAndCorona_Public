Grateful to see this issue finally getting the attention it deserves. Taking the words “climate change” off government websites won’t make it go away.

Its a shame we have to go out of SC to find a Republican who will simply acknowledge the outcome of the election.

New ad 📺  Everyone hates the middle seat. And the middle brother is scientifically proven to be the most annoying.   But in Congress being in the middle is a good thing.

My opponent @NancyMace is at it again lying about me and our two US Senators. Now fact-checkers are calling her ad "false" and she's even being rebuked by her own party.

No one voted to close Parris Island and Representative Mace's shameful attempt to use it as partisan political fodder cheapens its significance to South Carolina and demonstrates how unfit she is to be a member of Congress.,2020-09-29 17:55:18,Twitter Web App,21,227
And while Representative Mace has missed almost 30% of her votes at the state house this year I've done the work.

I'm not going to let them down simply because we're getting close to an election.   Rep. Mace continues to show that politics always comes first to her while the Lowcountry and her constituents come last.   That's the last thing we need in Congress.,2020-09-25 14:52:54,Twitter Web App,29,91
I’ve been in Washington the last week passing bipartisan legislation to avoid a gov't shutdown and my bill to help the VA tackle prostate cancer.

Mace has missed over 50 votes since she gave up on her day job many critical to the Lowcountry. Bills to increase funding for Charleston flooding rural broadband and CARES funding for our schools. Mace has missed almost 30% (!) of all her votes at the state house this year.,2020-09-25 14:52:54,Twitter Web App,34,58
One of the biggest problems in Washington is too many politicians care more about keeping their jobs - or being elected to the next one - than actually doing the work.

Nice cartoon but only people who supported a federal ban on drilling BEFORE Tuesday get to call me Lowcountry Joe. https://t.co/n5Nqx4VDmG,2020-09-10 21:42:26,Twitter for iPhone,163,1110
“Congress needs to pass a durable ban that future administrations cannot undo w the stroke of pen. That was the intent of a House-passed bill by Rep. Joe Cunningham that the Senate has failed to take up. That’s where Sens. Scott &amp; Graham must lend a hand.” https://t.co/EawGPNfpg9,2020-09-10 00:15:30,Twitter for iPhone,82,180

While something is certainly better than nothing the solution is not a temporary moratorium 8 weeks before an election. We need a *permanent* federal ban on drilling that can’t be lifted unilaterally by the president. My bill is sitting in the Senate for anyone who is serious. https://t.co/cbjELraalV,2020-09-08 23:04:56,Twitter for iPhone,179,472

Climate change is real.,2020-09-04 16:58:46,Twitter for iPad,103,804
Mace: "Locally here flooding is a massive issue and we do have sea levels rising *for whatever reason* here on the peninsula."  For whatever reason??  You don't have to be a scientist to believe in science @NancyMace. This is downright disqualifying in the Lowcountry. https://t.co/v91OMojgix,2020-09-04 02:00:42,Twitter Web App,44,217
.@AndyShain: "What is it exactly you're not sure about?"  Nancy Mace: "When you look at the history of Earth...we've had climate changes many times. I'm not a scientist but I like to read both sides of the issue."  I especially liked the part about the glaciers. https://t.co/54HP3ypK1I,2020-09-04 01:46:31,Twitter Web App,32,95
But there's more!  Nancy Mace on climate change: "You can't say one or the other when there's data on both sides of the issue."  Rep. Mace please enlighten us on the "science" that says climate change isn't real. I'll wait here. https://t.co/ck4lpFJWop,2020-09-04 01:23:38,Twitter Web App,52,205
Here's my opponent Nancy Mace in her own words answering a question about whether or not she believes in climate change: "I'm kind of mixed on this. I'm not a scientist. To me it's not clear cut." https://t.co/B7rsSaNlbx,2020-09-04 01:10:27,Twitter Web App,187,473
I can’t believe what I just heard. My opponent Nancy Mace just said the science behind climate change “isn’t clear cut” and is unsure whether it even exists. The Lowcountry can’t afford a climate denier in Congress.   Let’s make sure it doesn’t happen: https://t.co/cPKKC18Xi8,2020-09-03 22:59:59,Twitter for iPhone,262,711

Check out our new TV ad 📺  When I was asked in the 2018 #SC01 debate which law I would first propose in Congress I said a ban on offshore drilling.

My opponent is criticizing me for not holding in-person campaign events during a pandemic. Truth is I've held over 100 virtual events and 12 town halls since the beginning of COVID.

Instead of rushing to reopen schools before its safe we should first implement a statewide mask requirement like Alabama did today and get this virus under control ASAP.   3/3,2020-07-15 20:56:17,Twitter for iPad,35,254
I know how important it is to get our kids back in school. But we cannot wish this virus away. We must take the steps necessary to kill it.

Our state and Charleston in particular is at the epicenter for COVID and the last thing we should do is overrule our teachers parents and health professionals by making politically-motivated decisions to open our schools before it’s safe.   1/3,2020-07-15 20:56:16,Twitter for iPad,89,462

Glad the newest appropriations bill includes my legislation to block federal funding for offshore drilling along any US coastline. Oil spills don’t care about state lines.
