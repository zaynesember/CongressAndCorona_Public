As #CA39 is working to move out of the red tier it's concerning that my opponent @YoungKimCA hosted a superspreader event this past weekend in Orange County.  We can't afford to go backward.

After President Trump’s superspreader event in Orange County last week @YoungKimCA decided to host her own.

The choice couldn't be clearer. President Trump and my opponent @YoungKimCA want to dismantle the Affordable Care Act.

The audacity of the President to come to CA for a fundraiser after denying bipartisan calls for emergency wildfire assistance.

Sen. Mitch McConnell thinks we shouldn’t pass COVID relief because we’re too close to the election—even though he's rushing to pass a SCOTUS Justice right now.

#CA39 knows my record and how I fight for them every day. Young Kim believes she can trick voters by using retracted stories rewriting her terrible record and ignoring the money she’s raked in from Big Pharma Big Oil and Big Banks. She has to lie to win.

Separating children from their parents is cruel. And this Administration was so intently focused on separating families that "Border Patrol officers missed serious felony cases...[and] that sex offenders were released as a result."

As a lifelong Dodgers fan I’m not surprised the Giants owner is more invested in Republicans like Young Kim than his own team.

President Trump’s unwillingness to stand up to Putin or even call out the Russian bounties is a slap in the face to our servicemembers and their families. Our Commander-In-Chief is turning his back on them. https://t.co/nusjfK28G6,2020-07-29 16:30:20,Twitter for iPhone,17,49

The Senate had 2 months to respond to the #HeroesAct &amp; their last-minute bill falls short of delivering the relief we need. There’s no funding for cities school funding is tied to reopening &amp; they put big corporations over frontline workers. Sen.

Without federal assistance 40% of child care centers will close permanently. We need this service especially when parents return to work.

#100Days till Election Day.  Healthcare is on the ballot.

Sec. Betsy DeVos is out of touch with reality &amp; has no plan to keep our schools safe.  As the father of 2 young boys I share the concerns of our teachers &amp; parents in #CA39.

The lack of transparency is outrageous. 2 weeks ago House Republican leaders defeated a bipartisan PPP transparency bill.

I agree. It’s why the House passed #HR4 which restores the original Voting Rights Act and #HR1 which implements vital protections to our election infrastructure and expands voting rights.  But Sen. Mitch McConnell doesn’t want to vote on either bill. He’s the problem. https://t.co/CDwjmtm1y1,2020-06-10 01:21:59,Twitter for iPhone,59,132

In the middle of a global pandemic the President is delaying sending the stimulus checks because of his ego.  The American people need relief now.

The President just doesn't learn. This racist &amp; xenophobic language has no place in our society. The CDC Director says it's "absolutely wrong &amp; inappropriate" to call it "Chinese #coronavirus."  We should be standing with our #AAPI Asian American Community not targeting them. https://t.co/WYTGcb5Gay,2020-03-18 18:59:34,Twitter for iPhone,9,38

The President knows exactly what he’s doing by calling the #coronavirus the “Chinese virus.” The xenophobic racist language is the point. CDC says not to call it that.  #AAPI communities are already facing discrimination &amp; assault.

Grateful and honored to have the endorsement of @GiffordsCourage and @GabbyGiffords. We cannot stop working to pass common-sense gun safety legislation. #CA39 deserves action. #EnoughIsEnough https://t.co/ks3w2nyNiC,2020-02-13 22:48:25,Twitter for iPhone,41,132
The President’s budget—of cutting funding for Medicaid and the ACA—will hurt families in #CA39 especially those with pre-existing conditions. It’s shameful. We need leaders who will protect and strengthen healthcare not jeopardize it. https://t.co/XThore1E5R,2020-02-13 02:00:29,Twitter for iPhone,50,91
Proud to have the endorsement of the @clcv! I’m committed to protecting our #publiclands and environment for everyone in #CA39. https://t.co/tId1S7LnO9,2020-02-11 21:26:26,Twitter for iPhone,13,35
Over 100 servicemembers have been diagnosed with traumatic brain injuries (TBIs). The same TBIs the President described as “not very serious.”  This is very serious. It’s disgraceful to describe this anything less than serious. I’m praying for the recovery of our servicemembers. https://t.co/0aqmxx4hst,2020-02-10 21:40:12,Twitter for iPhone,182,225
"Drug prices are still not going down." Families are still struggling with high prices and they deserve relief.  We can start by reining in Big Pharma's price gouging tactics and creating a drug pricing system that works for the American people. https://t.co/TOLQ35liae,2020-02-09 22:05:05,Twitter for iPhone,24,47
An EPA official was fired for being too bipartisan. You read that right.   It’s ridiculous that this Administration punishes people who work across the aisle. Protecting our environment and fighting climate change is on all of us regardless of party. https://t.co/wsP0vG1Ude,2020-02-07 23:23:40,Twitter for iPhone,16,24
Reality Check: The President supports the Texas lawsuit that would overturn the Affordable Care Act and gut pre-existing condition protections.  He’s trying to strip healthcare coverage from families in #CA39 and across the country. https://t.co/VEmHFdrz8u,2020-02-06 01:51:00,Twitter for iPhone,92,112
This can’t be forgotten. Big Pharma keeps on raising drug prices even though families in #CA39 and across the country can’t afford their life-saving medicine.  I’m fighting to hold Big Pharma accountable and lower drug prices for all Americans. https://t.co/RxDQtyZ9qo,2020-02-04 19:36:41,Twitter for iPhone,23,36

Proud to join the Orange County Labor Federation at their Leadership Rally this morning! I’ll continue to fight for our unions and hard-working families all across #CA39. #UnionStrong https://t.co/AO0ZjCV5jR,2020-02-01 21:56:45,Twitter for iPhone,7,29
In 2015 the President said “I’m not going to cut Social Security like every other Republican &amp; I’m not going to cut Medicare or Medicaid.”  He lied. This latest assault on our healthcare is making cuts to Medicaid. We need leaders who will protect our healthcare not destroy it. https://t.co/52No14SP0n,2020-01-31 01:05:58,Twitter for iPhone,79,116
Drug prices are out control. No family should have to choose between putting food on the table or paying for life-saving medication.  It’s about time we hold Big Pharma accountable and lower drug prices for Americans in #CA39 and across the country.,2020-01-29 03:24:59,Twitter for iPhone,18,74

This is heartbreaking. In Los Angeles across Southern California and around the world Kobe Bryant was a household name—a global icon. The Mamba Mentality is legendary.

Heart-wrenching. Please keep our servicemembers in your prayers.  Traumatic brain injuries that the President had described as “headaches” &amp; “not very serious.”   As a Navy Veteran I take the safety &amp; health of our patriots extremely seriously. Anything less is unacceptable. https://t.co/nu9FCDFErV,2020-01-24 21:25:34,Twitter for iPhone,33,66
9-year-old Byron waited over 600 days nearly 2 years to be reunited with his dad.  And there are hundreds of children—maybe thousands—who are still separated from their parents and families.  This needs to be said over and over again: #FamiliesBelongTogether. https://t.co/W1p73tCjXj,2020-01-24 02:33:56,Twitter for iPhone,11,35
Reproductive freedom is for every body.  Everyone should have the freedom to make decisions about their reproductive lives and health free from political interference. Protecting and expanding this fundamental freedom is more urgent now than ever. #7in10ForRoe @NARAL https://t.co/AIRSl5bNcz,2020-01-22 23:33:07,Twitter for iPhone,8,22
Praying for a speedy recovery for our injured servicemembers and for the safety of all our patriots overseas.  It’s a disgrace that the President would compare potential traumatic brain injuries as “headaches.” Our men and women in uniform deserve better. https://t.co/tfNI4rFFif,2020-01-22 17:07:25,Twitter for iPhone,74,233
The reckless disastrous Citizens United decision broke our democracy. Special interests shouldn’t have more power than the American people. Period.   We must overturn Citizens United now. 10 years of unlimited undisclosed political spending is too many. #EndCitizensUnited https://t.co/0GbxvADdyz,2020-01-21 22:43:33,Twitter for iPhone,23,53
On #MLKDay we honor and remember  Dr. Martin Luther King Jr’s legacy words and activism.
