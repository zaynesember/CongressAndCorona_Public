The Trump Administration's #DirtyWaterRule is a direct attack on our basic human right to clean water. I stand proud to support @RepDebDingell &amp; @RepChrisPappas' #CleanWaterAct resolution to #ProtectCleanWater. https://t.co/QZ0khYCm5k,2020-01-24 16:03:47,Twitter Web App,8,13

. @CongressmanRuiz @RepDarrenSoto &amp; I urged the @FCC to review the widespread network outages caused by the earthquakes in #PuertoRico. We must prioritize the needs of ALL Americans during times of crisis including the people of Puerto Rico.  👀 Read our letter below ⬇️: https://t.co/7Up14klG8h,2020-01-23 16:06:00,Twitter for iPhone,15,22
Whatever our zip code however much money we make and whatever our immigration status we should all be able to get insurance coverage for the full range of health care including birth control abortion and childbirth. Roe must work in real life for all of us. #RoeIRL,2020-01-22 20:27:45,Twitter Web App,10,35
Time and time again this Administration's FEMA has failed to address the impact of climate change on our communities. Proud that @SenMarkey one of the strongest advocates for #ClimateChange has introduced the counterpart to my FEMA Climate Change Preparedness Act in the Senate. https://t.co/GKOJB75knx,2020-01-22 16:07:56,Twitter Web App,11,27
I couldn’t help but think about #TheJetsons when thinking about the #FutureofWork. Special thanks to @RepLBR and @RepBryanSteil for their leadership in creating the Future of Work Caucus. I’m excited to join this Caucus and bring our initiatives and shared vision back to #NY09. https://t.co/hi3CdthsIc,2020-01-21 21:10:03,Twitter Media Studio,2,11
It was a joy to catch up with my friend Gwen Carr mother of Eric Garner and advocate for equality and justice. I’m grateful for women like Gwen who have worked tirelessly to keep Dr. King’s legacy alive. https://t.co/xmmgIKsbHQ,2020-01-21 20:40:19,Twitter for iPhone,6,37
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was the voice of the voiceless who dedicated his life to ensure that all Americans regardless of their skin color achieved equal opportunity. As a beneficiary of Dr. King’s work I have a duty to help realize his dream of a “promised land.” #MLKDay,2020-01-20 15:28:31,Twitter for iPhone,18,52
