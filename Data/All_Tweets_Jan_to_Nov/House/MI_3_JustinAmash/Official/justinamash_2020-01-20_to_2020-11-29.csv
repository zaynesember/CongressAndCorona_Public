@ThoBishop @AP4Liberty Yes but I continue to posit that while I often see libertarians relying on his earlier writings with respect to nationalism (or language or foreigners) the later writings of Mises are almost invariably ignored likely because they present quotes that prove quite problematic.,2020-11-28 03:47:21,Twitter for iPhone,0,1
@ThoBishop @AP4Liberty Thank you.,2020-11-28 03:21:21,Twitter for iPhone,0,11
@ThoBishop @AP4Liberty Probably not w/r/t Brexit. Less clear w/r/t some global orgs to the extent they lack real powers and are just for engagement. It may be semantics but I think that’s mainly because some of you believe libertarians should capitalize on nationalist sentiments despite the dangers.,2020-11-28 03:20:40,Twitter for iPhone,0,6
@ThoBishop @AP4Liberty No you can see the change in his thinking. You’re right that it was based on circumstances but that’s almost always how changed thinking works. Of course he pulled concepts like self-determination into his later works but he clearly tried to distance them from nationalism.,2020-11-28 03:02:54,Twitter for iPhone,0,8
Defending civil liberties or exercising First Amendment-secured rights does not make one a Russian agent and baseless smears don’t count as evidence.

@ThoBishop @AP4Liberty Mises changed his mind on nationalism following World War II. It’s fine to cite his earlier stance but it’s important to note that he later recognized the dangers of that position. https://t.co/04KNSnijUQ,2020-11-28 01:46:39,Twitter for iPhone,0,12
Liberty is an idea.

@DanDDouglas I wrote several threads you can find and read on Mueller’s report. Impeachment is like an indictment.

@Kellen_Jonathan I think it’s mostly about changing public expectations of leaders by informing the public of what’s really going on. It’s not easy to fix and will progress toward this end over time without public pressure. Following legislative rules needs to become an important value in itself.,2020-11-14 18:29:53,Twitter for iPhone,3,51
@Kellen_Jonathan No reform needs to happen within Congress. Ideological diversity isn’t the problem. Leaders must follow legislative process.

@Kellen_Jonathan No Pelosi does not let the legislative process function any more than McConnell. Congressional dysfunction won’t be addressed until people acknowledge and accept that.

@AP4Liberty @chrisspangle @RareCamellia Yes but it’s a much broader negative critique of nationalism than most people recognize (a lot of people are unfamiliar with his later views on this).

Trump gets lowest percentage in Kent of any Republican presidential candidate in more than 50 years.  In Kent County (Grand Rapids) where President @realDonaldTrump rallied on Monday night:  ➡️ 2020:    51.9% Biden  to  46.1% Trump  ➡️ 2016:    48.3% Trump  to  45.2% Clinton https://t.co/QTg8KLjme2,2020-11-05 00:51:03,Twitter for iPhone,295,2140
@JessFagerstrom Thanks. I do get it. It’s all a matter of perspective though. I happen to think the biggest threat to liberty is a breakdown in societal trust which is something Trump specializes in. All the other liberty issues are impacted by that.,2020-11-04 23:37:00,Twitter for iPhone,3,43
@JessFagerstrom No what’s politically motivated is all the people who know Trump is a disaster—an actual president with power—who remain so silent about him or worse excuse his actions and cheerlead for him.,2020-11-04 23:17:00,Twitter for iPhone,3,45
@JessFagerstrom I’ve criticized both of them. But I focus my criticisms on those in power: Obama Boehner Ryan Pelosi Trump. Biden isn’t currently the president. He has no power. If/when he has power he’ll get the same scrutiny for his actions as president.,2020-11-04 23:10:34,Twitter for iPhone,4,69

As noted Michigan counts Election Day votes first but most people (especially Dems) cast mail-in ballots this year. That means Trump jumped out to what looked like a big lead before mail-in votes were counted. His lost ground isn’t fraud; it’s called counting every legal vote. https://t.co/efqdavtHBL,2020-11-04 19:48:33,Twitter for iPhone,4220,22834

So this is where the disinformation about Kent County came from. It looked bad for Trump almost immediately if you’re familiar with voting here. When all votes are counted Donald Trump will be only the second GOP presidential candidate to lose the county in more than 50 years. https://t.co/xNNvgMKuNQ,2020-11-04 16:56:51,Twitter for iPhone,275,1936

Kent County’s largest city and Michigan’s second largest city Grand Rapids still hasn’t reported most of its votes. It’s a heavily Democratic city.

If libertarians are to succeed at moving politics in a more liberty-oriented direction then we must build our own brand as far away from Donald Trump as possible. Libertarianism’s compelling vision for securing individual rights has to get out from under the shadow of Trumpism.,2020-11-03 00:30:37,Twitter for iPhone,371,3156
Trump massively gains from this exchange and libertarianism loses. By neutralizing or co-opting potential libertarian critics Trump is left largely unchecked with respect to his unlibertarian actions while libertarianism is falsely and harmfully cast as a relative of Trumpism.,2020-11-03 00:30:37,Twitter for iPhone,147,1690
Meanwhile libertarians have been taken for a ride. It’s been an almost entirely one-way relationship.

We shouldn’t confuse Trump’s anti-establishment rhetoric with anti-establishment actions. He’s been the greatest gift to establishment politicians like Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy who needed Trump’s celebrity to sell their unpopular schemes to the grassroots of the party.,2020-11-03 00:30:36,Twitter for iPhone,244,1865

Trump doesn’t respect federalism or separation of powers declaring that “when somebody is the president of the United States the authority is total and that’s the way it’s got to be.”  He consistently undermines local decision making and supports new forms of central planning.,2020-11-03 00:30:36,Twitter for iPhone,195,1593

Trump directed a federal crackdown on vaping products and signed a bill raising the federal tobacco age to 21.,2020-11-03 00:30:36,Twitter for iPhone,94,1271

Trump has spent billions of taxpayer dollars bailing out the agriculture industry that he harmed with his own trade policies and he signed a bill extending the cronyist Export-Import Bank for seven years.,2020-11-03 00:30:35,Twitter for iPhone,154,1510

Trump rails against surveillance of his own associates but he signed FISA 702 and a Patriot Act reauthorization hired DoJ leadership that supports warrantless surveillance and attacked private companies for refusing to build government backdoors into every person’s phone.,2020-11-03 00:30:35,Twitter for iPhone,188,1625
Trump also revived the federal death penalty. He’s executed more people in the last few months than his predecessors had in more than 60 years.  He detained an American citizen without charge or trial for over a year.,2020-11-03 00:30:34,Twitter for iPhone,228,1695
Trump’s AGs have also worked to impose the federal government on state and local criminal justice systems by attacking local efforts at reform.  He has fought federal policing reform and he sent federal police to interfere in matters within local officials’ jurisdictions.,2020-11-03 00:30:34,Twitter for iPhone,152,1536
Trump loves to tout his record on criminal justice reform but he appointed attorneys general that have expanded civil asset forfeiture and ended Department of Justice policies that were intended to limit marijuana enforcement and reduce harsh criminal sentencing.,2020-11-03 00:30:34,Twitter for iPhone,216,1754
He also bypassed Congress to push through weapons sales to foreign countries including billions of dollars in arms to Saudi Arabia—and he used the prospect of lucrative arms sales to excuse the Saudis after their government’s murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.,2020-11-03 00:30:34,Twitter for iPhone,200,1770
Trump has overseen a significant increase in U.S. military spending and brags about how much is being spent on military equipment. https://t.co/1PPkzzcsWs,2020-11-03 00:30:34,Twitter for iPhone,153,1663
Trump sometimes acts like he’s opposed to the military-industrial complex even suggesting the Pentagon wants “to do nothing but fight wars” in order to keep defense contractors happy but no one has been a bigger booster of the defense industry than Trump.,2020-11-03 00:30:34,Twitter for iPhone,173,1797
He also vetoed measures passed by Congress to limit U.S. involvement in Yemen’s civil war block weapons sales that support it and prevent war with Iran. More than half of Trump’s vetoes (five of eight) have been against measures trying to limit U.S. military aggression abroad.,2020-11-03 00:30:33,Twitter for iPhone,241,2029
Despite repeating over and over that he wants to end wars and bring home the troops Trump actually increased our military presence in the Middle East and launched attacks in multiple countries without congressional approval—record strikes in places like Afghanistan and Somalia.,2020-11-03 00:30:33,Twitter for iPhone,348,2413

@JulieBorowski He’s been a lot worse than I expected. He’s largely continued the Bush/Obama war footing (more bombings roughly same troop levels) while claiming to be a noninterventionist.

@Gaia_Eternal @TimmTexan @JulieBorowski There is no law to keep us in Afghanistan. Being president is tough. People will try to hinder your efforts.

@Gaia_Eternal @TimmTexan @JulieBorowski What about it? He’s been president for four years and peace is always just around the next corner according to Trump.

@JulieBorowski Trump hasn’t gotten us out of a single war and he expanded and escalated wars including Afghanistan Somalia and Yemen. More troops are in the Middle East now than when he began.

I think Chairman Pai is playing a (dangerous) word game here.

We have not been allowed to offer amendments on the House floor in more than four years. In effect every bill we vote on is take it or leave it.  This is not legislating.,2020-10-14 16:34:50,Twitter for iPhone,1608,8140
The bills that passed through the House did not go through anything resembling proper legislative process. Nobody was able to amend or provide real input—or even read them. Consequently they’re just messaging bills and not a foundation for compromise. https://t.co/gBwAEich0B,2020-10-14 16:06:42,Twitter for iPhone,121,546
This is not legislating. Speaker Pelosi continues to use Steven Mnuchin as a stand-in for the U.S. House of Representatives. If she spent one-tenth as much time on actual legislative process (amendments debates) we’d have reached a genuine basis for agreement long ago. https://t.co/IjmfzYPZIt,2020-10-14 16:00:47,Twitter for iPhone,256,1391
This Senate is bad. Mitch McConnell is awful. But I don’t serve in the Senate; I serve in the House. And I’m going to keep pointing out what’s wrong with this House and with this speaker of the House just as I did when the speaker was a Republican.,2020-10-13 22:48:51,Twitter for iPhone,544,5826
*That* is not legislating. The House did not write that bill; a few people did. Most of us were told to come back when needed to push green or red on the voting machine. No amendments allowed. Compromise needs to happen not just vis-à-vis the Senate but also within the House. https://t.co/iETNFPtx3n,2020-10-13 22:38:23,Twitter for iPhone,96,697
The House did not work for weeks. It is not enough to pass something that nobody in the House read or helped craft. Steven Mnuchin is not a legislator and he is not a shortcut for legislating. We must have an open process that reflects the will of the people’s representatives. https://t.co/7mgSw9QIOt,2020-10-13 22:23:00,Twitter for iPhone,115,686

Antiwar President Donald Trump has launched more air and drone strikes in Somalia over just the last year than Barack Obama did over all eight years and about as many strikes per year as GWB and Obama combined and totaled from 2002 (war’s start) to January 2017 (inauguration).,2020-09-12 16:05:25,Twitter for iPhone,15385,38400

@AnonymousStaffr I was referring to rate originally. I also can’t opine on countries for which we don’t have reliable data. But there’s a pattern of escalation which stands out even more because the administration has reduced transparency.

And let’s not forget the drone wars. That’s where Trump is unambiguously the worst launching strikes at a far higher rate than Obama. The lack of transparency from this administration combined with the media’s failure to report on the wars has helped hide this horrific reality.,2020-09-09 16:48:56,Twitter for iPhone,756,3534
Conservatives and libertarians like me who repeatedly criticized Obama for not ending those wars are now supposed to praise Trump for simply promising to do a fraction of what Obama did? Why?

To put things in perspective: From the start of his term to the end Barack Obama reduced troop levels in Afghanistan by ~25K and Iraq by ~140K. Donald Trump has so far reduced those troop levels by zero with hopes of reducing troop levels in Afghanistan by ~4K and Iraq by ~2K.,2020-09-09 16:48:55,Twitter for iPhone,2463,7297

We must decentralize power and have serious debates on other issues of national importance as well but it’s especially crucial here because our failure to pass meaningful reforms will help perpetuate direct violations of Americans’ rights.

Congress continues to squander opportunities to genuinely legislate by giving all the power to leadership and avoiding difficult debates and votes.

We can do better through real debate. There’s widespread public support for some serious reforms and we can find compromise if we deliberate and proceed meticulously.

I’m not saying all these reforms must be in the House bill; in fact I’m against cramming so many things into one bill. But House leaders do support having one giant bill yet their proposal sidesteps key issues.

The House bill also fails to grapple with overcriminalization as a key source of the problems it’s trying to address. We can’t fix the issues in law enforcement without ending our overreliance on policing (and the criminal justice system more broadly) to implement public policy.,2020-06-22 18:00:24,Twitter for iPhone,74,444
The legislation from Senate Republicans also focuses mostly on changes that states can already do while ignoring some key federal reforms. If federalism is their concern they should at least be interested in fixing the federal practices that undermine state policies.,2020-06-22 18:00:24,Twitter for iPhone,48,335
The bill doesn’t even address the federal practices that undermine states’ efforts to eliminate civil asset forfeiture which incentivizes cops to initiate interactions with the public and take property from people who haven’t even been charged with a crime.,2020-06-22 18:00:23,Twitter for iPhone,60,409
The bill includes many state-level reforms that could be done without the federal government yet it overlooks some important changes that only the federal government can make such as fully ending transfers of equipment from the Department of Defense to police.,2020-06-22 18:00:23,Twitter for iPhone,57,403

The bill also includes H.R. 35 which increases penalties for various crimes while falsely presenting itself as a bill to ban lynching—which is already a federal hate crime. In fact H.R. 35 simply references existing laws. I detailed H.R. 35’s many problems here: https://t.co/OAYBDmyFgQ,2020-06-22 18:00:22,Twitter for iPhone,53,396
This is not to say that the Department of Justice has no role to play in reforming policing but it’s obviously a terrible idea to put Bill Barr in charge of designing and enforcing rules for how police in America operate.,2020-06-22 18:00:21,Twitter for iPhone,79,559
The bill tasks the Department of Justice with designing guidance and regulations to implement many of the policing reforms but DoJ—regardless of who is in the White House—is itself part of our brutal disastrous criminal justice system.,2020-06-22 18:00:21,Twitter for iPhone,60,420
Specifically the reforms are structured as conditions on Department of Justice grants that are available only if the state or city receiving the grant uses the money to increase their overall law enforcement funding not just replace state or local funding.,2020-06-22 18:00:21,Twitter for iPhone,46,363
This problem is compounded by the fact that most of the bill’s reforms for state and local law enforcement (where the vast majority of policing happens) are required only if the state or city is willing to accept federal dollars to increase their spending on law enforcement.,2020-06-22 18:00:20,Twitter for iPhone,57,400
The bill provides *more* money for police and prosecutors which may undermine local efforts to change the role of policing in communities. The ACLU calls it a “nonstarter” noting “The role of police has to be smaller more circumscribed and less funded with taxpayer dollars.”,2020-06-22 18:00:20,Twitter for iPhone,84,530
The bill reforms but doesn’t end qualified immunity; in fact it implicitly endorses it for most officials including prison guards. It suggests Congress supports immunizing such officials for abusing rights—contrary to Congress’s intent in passing the Civil Rights Act of 1871.,2020-06-22 18:00:20,Twitter for iPhone,113,624
Because I’m in the House I’ll focus this thread on that bill. The Justice in Policing Act has several provisions that take us backward and rushing it through the House will stifle debate on some important reforms and issues that it overlooks.,2020-06-22 18:00:19,Twitter for iPhone,76,569

@EricRossoni That’s not my reasoning. Lynching *specifically* as defined in the bill is already a federal hate crime. I’m talking about lynching not just murder. The bill is short. It’s not hard to find the truth.,2020-06-12 21:01:05,Twitter for iPhone,0,23

This pattern continues because police are legally politically and culturally insulated from consequences for violating the rights of the people whom they have sworn to serve. That must change so that these incidents of brutality stop happening.,2020-06-01 01:30:32,Twitter for iPhone,955,4577

This rule has sharply narrowed the situations in which police can be held liable—even for truly heinous rights violations—and it creates a disincentive to bringing cases in the first place.,2020-06-01 01:30:31,Twitter for iPhone,572,3343
Under qualified immunity police are immune from liability unless the person whose rights they violated can show that there is a previous case in the same jurisdiction involving the exact same facts in which a court deemed the actions to be a constitutional violation.,2020-06-01 01:30:31,Twitter for iPhone,832,3861
As part of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 Congress allowed individuals to sue state and local officials including police officers who violate their rights.

The fact is that Twitter doesn’t create much of its own content. If Donald Trump wants to sue over fact checks that Twitter creates he’s welcome to do so. Section 230 doesn’t prohibit it. But he will lose nonetheless because of the First Amendment.,2020-05-29 15:10:57,Twitter for iPhone,161,1296

Twitter is not immune from being sued for defamatory content it creates. This argument by Donald Trump and his Senate defenders about Section 230—that Twitter can’t be sued for defamation—is false.

To the extent Twitter creates its own content that’s already not protected by Section 230. And you haven’t addressed the false or misleading claims from your letter. You’re attempting to silence speech under the guise of fixing a legal discrepancy that doesn’t exist. Nice try! https://t.co/K2EZggxm4y,2020-05-28 22:42:20,Twitter for iPhone,543,2577

“It makes little sense to treat companies that publish their editorial comments about others’ content as if they are mere distributors.”  The law doesn’t treat anyone as “mere” anything. It’s contextual not all or nothing.,2020-05-28 20:33:02,Twitter for iPhone,41,429
“Twitter’s decision to affix its own editorial content to users’ posts brings into question the basis for that immunity.”  Twitter has no special immunity. You and I have the same immunity. It’s always contextual not blanket immunity.,2020-05-28 20:33:01,Twitter for iPhone,45,492
“That statute tells courts to treat Twitter like a passive distributor of third-party content.”  False. The statute is about what you do not who you are. You’re not liable when you moderate content. You’re potentially liable when you create content. That’s true for everyone.,2020-05-28 20:33:01,Twitter for iPhone,63,568
“But under Section 230 Twitter receives a special government carve-out that shields it from liability.”  False. Everyone is treated the same including “traditional publishers” and anyone reading this tweet or breathing.,2020-05-28 20:33:01,Twitter for iPhone,67,565
“Traditional publishers are liable when they mess up.”  True. So is Twitter for any content it creates just like “traditional publishers.” There is no difference.,2020-05-28 20:33:00,Twitter for iPhone,61,555
“But editorializing is what publishers do like the New York Times and the Washington Post. Your company is treated very differently from publishers as you know.”  False.

Section 230 doesn’t classify entities as either “platforms” or “publishers.” It says an entity isn’t the publisher of someone else’s content and isn’t liable for moderating that content. The protection is contextual not all or nothing. If you create content you may be liable.,2020-05-28 18:05:53,Twitter for iPhone,154,834

@OrinKerr Others have wrongly assumed I am dismissing scientific knowledge. I’m doing no such thing. I’m saying we must better complement it with local knowledge. We are too reliant on a few people to keep us safe when safety requires we effectively utilize as much knowledge as possible.,2020-05-14 14:52:18,Twitter for iPhone,20,65
@OrinKerr Governors advised by scientists can set rules but they can’t readily observe how those rules impact behavior. They’re focused on aggregates when real life is about individual actions. They have no ability to know how rules affect actions at particular stores in real time.,2020-05-14 14:50:11,Twitter for iPhone,6,32
@OrinKerr I appreciate your thoughtful reply. Hayek’s insights don’t apply just to the field of economics. If we’re talking simply about studying (or observing) the spread of a virus then you’re right that scientists are largely equipped to tackle the problem. But we’re not.,2020-05-14 14:45:45,Twitter for iPhone,4,18

@RadioFreeTom It sounds like you’re making a political point not a scientific one. The fact that you and I have serious problems with Donald Trump doesn’t mean that local knowledge should be dismissed. It complements scientific knowledge and is critical to effectively tackling the virus.,2020-05-14 01:56:17,Twitter for iPhone,7,78
@mkieval @RadioFreeTom More the former (county or community-based rules) but I also believe (state and local) governments should engage more with individuals and businesses to adopt more efficient and effective measures that better incorporate local knowledge.,2020-05-14 01:49:00,Twitter for iPhone,5,25
@WindsorMann @RadioFreeTom Yes.,2020-05-14 01:37:20,Twitter for iPhone,3,27
@RadioFreeTom I’m setting no requirement for their knowledge. Your assumption reflects your own bias. I’m pointing out that we need both viral science and local knowledge of circumstances to effectively fight a virus but state governments have shown disdain for the latter kind of knowledge.,2020-05-14 01:34:27,Twitter for iPhone,12,72
@RadioFreeTom Your position is that epidemiologists can know the specific actions of each individual in a community? You can’t really believe that.,2020-05-14 01:20:47,Twitter for iPhone,3,42
@SamHarlan7 Correct. More precisely I’m pointing out that we need both viral science and local knowledge of circumstances to effectively fight a virus but state governments have shown disdain for the latter kind of knowledge.,2020-05-14 00:55:29,Twitter for iPhone,6,34
@Timothydykstra She should stop forcing all counties to follow the same rules. Fighting the virus effectively requires a bottom-up approach that utilizes both viral science and local knowledge of circumstances. Counties should work cooperatively with businesses too to adopt the best approach.,2020-05-13 23:02:53,Twitter for iPhone,17,101
@DemetriKots @1BrianMusser @gtconway3d I didn’t say otherwise. It’s because we don’t have perfect knowledge that local knowledge is important for fighting a virus just as virology is important for understanding a virus. They are not mutually exclusive but governors consistently dismiss the first kind of knowledge.,2020-05-13 22:53:39,Twitter for iPhone,1,17
@yourfriendmags As an example a business owner will know how to manage traffic in her specific grocery store much better than a governor advised by a scientist. Lansing can’t account for particular circumstances. A blanket rule may cause a huge line out the door that helps spread the virus.,2020-05-13 22:51:31,Twitter for iPhone,6,53
@gtconway3d My first tweet should have been more precise but I’m referring to the actions of individuals not people in the aggregate. No scientist has such knowledge—because no one person can obtain it. But these micro interactions make all the difference in limiting the spread of a virus.,2020-05-13 22:30:46,Twitter for iPhone,31,469
Epidemiologists cannot know the specific actions of each individual in a community. This kind of knowledge is not knowable to any scientist. The top mistake being made by state governments is their imposing uniform rules that limit the use of local knowledge to fight the virus.,2020-05-13 20:08:28,Twitter for iPhone,330,2061
@TheGinjeNinja I’m the person saying you need both. The belief that scientists and governors should impose blanket rules on society is misguided and dangerous. They don’t have the most important knowledge.,2020-05-13 19:30:10,Twitter for iPhone,15,137
@TheGinjeNinja It is relevant. Millions of people take individual actions every day. That information—not in the aggregate but rather on an individual basis—is not available to scientists anywhere. A business owner has knowledge about keeping her customers safe that no scientist could have.,2020-05-13 19:18:07,Twitter for iPhone,8,128

A scientist may know a virus’s characteristics but he doesn’t know a community’s characteristics: how they feel eat shop work and operate businesses.

@KurtWallace I fully support open carry in Michigan and the right of protesters to bear arms in the Capitol. But that doesn’t mean it’s wise to openly carry arms in the Senate gallery above legislators on the floor.

@dahollafish @GibbonsOnRye @cjane87 @brad_polumbo Issues of racism and discrimination deserve significant attention and will be discussed over the course of the campaign. The good news is that there are more avenues of recourse available today to those who face discrimination than at any time in history.,2020-05-04 21:16:32,Twitter for iPhone,4,32
@dahollafish @GibbonsOnRye @cjane87 @brad_polumbo Yes but prevalence depends on many factors including type of job location etc. Empirical evidence can’t be effectively obtained because it involves secret motivations that won’t readily be admitted to pollsters or analysts. There’s a lot of anecdotal evidence from businesses.,2020-05-04 20:30:09,Twitter for iPhone,0,28
@GibbonsOnRye @cjane87 @brad_polumbo For example some employers that otherwise would not discriminate may be more reluctant to hire someone if all else equal there’s a higher potential for litigation and liability if that person does not work out.

@GibbonsOnRye @cjane87 @brad_polumbo Certain nondiscrimination laws in employment may now have an effect opposite of what is intended.

@GibbonsOnRye @cjane87 @brad_polumbo Motels and diners were directed to discriminate by many state governments. We can’t effectively remedy the impact of that discrimination simply by invalidating those state laws; we must do more. Federal nondiscrimination laws serve a key role for at least some time afterward.,2020-05-04 19:12:08,Twitter for iPhone,1,48
@GibbonsOnRye @cjane87 @brad_polumbo The federal government has a critical role in protecting individual rights and remedying state-mandated discrimination. At its core libertarianism as a governing philosophy is about securing rights.,2020-05-04 18:28:52,Twitter for iPhone,8,102
@cjane87 @brad_polumbo The point I’m making: Lots of people are skeptical of libertarianism in the abstract but embrace it in the concrete i.e. when discussing specific issues they know and care about.

@RandyEBarnett I agree. My point is that the comparison to previous Republican administrations is apples to oranges because the threshold for confirmation was higher before the Reid-McConnell changes. Previous Republicans had to nominate judges they believed could get through Senate Democrats.,2020-05-04 01:45:03,Twitter for iPhone,3,43
@RandyEBarnett My point is necessary to make the case. It’s obvious that Senate rules—and the ease of a party-line confirmation—dramatically impact who will be nominated. If the White House needs 60 votes instead of 51 votes the picks on the whole will look very different.,2020-05-04 01:32:53,Twitter for iPhone,2,29
@RandyEBarnett That’s right. But I didn’t say McConnell appointed them. I said I attributed their appointment to McConnell’s lower threshold. It’s easy for the White House to nominate (supposedly) conservative judges when the administration knows the nominees can get through the Senate.,2020-05-04 01:17:04,Twitter for iPhone,2,36

@guypbenson Assuming I like these judges I attribute their appointment to McConnell and not Trump (or his presidency). For the record I think the lower threshold is a mistake. Judges are appointed for life and standards should be high. A low threshold helps the left get their judges too.,2020-05-04 01:04:41,Twitter for iPhone,12,99
@guypbenson I can’t speak to the quality of each judge but the ability to appoint (supposedly) more conservative judges has almost everything to do with Senate rules changes (lower threshold to confirm) and almost nothing to do with Trump relative to any other Republican president.,2020-05-04 00:51:04,Twitter for iPhone,35,331

But adding money to PPP isn’t sufficient. Congress is closing its eyes to what went wrong.

Congress must rethink all of it.,2020-04-23 20:20:08,Twitter for iPhone,90,688
Those who voted yes on the last bill created an administrative mess that exacerbated inequities such as the denial of PPP access to many small businesses—and today’s vote must not send the message that those businesses don’t deserve fairness. This issue must be addressed.,2020-04-23 20:20:08,Twitter for iPhone,51,456
Now that leaders have dumped it in our laps it’s no surprise that the bill adds funds to PPP without fixing the problems within PPP or within the broader relief package.

We’ve had weeks to work out solutions to these issues and we could’ve done so if House and Senate leadership had allowed members to work on and debate today’s bill. Instead they ignored members who asked for ways to deliberate remotely and negotiated this bill on their own.,2020-04-23 20:20:07,Twitter for iPhone,43,306
The enhanced UI benefits are creating a disincentive to return to work causing tension with PPP. At the same time many people who desperately need help aren’t getting it. For those ineligible for UI or other relief programs the one-time $1200 check isn’t cutting it.,2020-04-23 20:20:07,Twitter for iPhone,34,252

It’s been almost a month since Congress passed a $2 trillion bill secretly drafted with little scrutiny. That bill predictably failed on multiple fronts.

This also would stop the program from continuing to penalize small businesses that find they’re unable to rehire employees because newly enhanced unemployment insurance benefits during the pandemic are bigger than workers’ paychecks would be.,2020-04-21 18:00:41,Twitter for iPhone,44,328
Those fixes should include giving businesses flexibility to use funds to change to new models that will help them adapt and survive which means allowing them greater latitude to apply funds without penalty not just on staffing but also on other essential items and functions.,2020-04-21 18:00:41,Twitter for iPhone,33,293
PPP needs more money but more money won’t be enough without other substantial fixes to the program.,2020-04-21 18:00:40,Twitter for iPhone,39,286
But the businesses that aren’t favored by banks are less likely to have access to loans outside of PPP which means those businesses—the ones that are having the most trouble getting PPP funds—may be the ones that most need access to it.,2020-04-21 18:00:40,Twitter for iPhone,46,330
By capping PPP and having banks decide which businesses get funds Congress and the White House created a system in which businesses with strong banking connections are getting easier access to funds while other businesses are shut out.,2020-04-21 18:00:40,Twitter for iPhone,104,549
The Paycheck Protection Program unfairly left millions of small businesses in the cold. We need to rectify that. But PPP won’t be fixed just by adding money to it. The program has major flaws that need to be addressed right away.,2020-04-21 18:00:40,Twitter for iPhone,341,1994

@WillRicci They approve funding but that’s in the form of giant omnibus bills or defense authorizations and appropriations which combine multiple issues. There’s little accountability when it comes to specific wars and no express authorization since 2002.,2020-04-17 20:16:50,Twitter for iPhone,4,71
Our national debt is skyrocketing and unapproved overseas wars continue to cost hundreds of billions of dollars—on top of lost lives serious injuries and grief for families.

The president uses vague calls to action so he can avoid responsibility and later claim he meant something else. Just yesterday he was outlining a phased approach for “opening up America again.” He should be specific about his concerns.

Many of @GovWhitmer’s latest measures do little to combat COVID-19 but much to curb freedoms and escalate tensions. The governor should re-evaluate before she loses public support for more essential health and safety practices.  Thread: https://t.co/zgjJOoza4H,2020-04-13 20:58:27,Twitter for iPhone,140,640

In a crisis there’s no way to make things perfect. Government officials face considerable pressure and are bound to make mistakes. I’m confident @GovWhitmer means well but I encourage her to reconsider her current approach. Bring everyone together to get us safely through this.,2020-04-11 20:15:44,Twitter for iPhone,128,1124
The governor needs to allow communities and businesses to establish safety procedures based on actual conditions. Not every place has the same risks and it’s not good governance good health science or good economics to pretend they do.,2020-04-11 20:15:44,Twitter for iPhone,136,1027
Other aspects of the governor’s order may also produce unintended and undesired consequences. For example while she understandably doesn’t want too many people inside stores a blanket limit may create long lines outside which will put people in closer contact with one another.,2020-04-11 20:15:44,Twitter for iPhone,77,758

If the governor wants to sustain her order that people stay at home then she must do her best to ensure they can pass the time engaged in activities and projects that bring them joy and satisfaction. Her latest measures do the opposite.,2020-04-11 20:15:43,Twitter for iPhone,103,1012
At the very least government officials need to trust people with matters that are extremely low risk.

Sensible instructions to practice social distancing wear masks and stay at home already do most of the work to reduce the virus’s spread.

As a federal official I do my best to stay out of state politics. But I have a constitutional duty to ensure states don’t trample on the rights of the people. @GovWhitmer’s latest order goes too far and will erode confidence in her leadership. She should immediately reassess it.,2020-04-11 20:15:41,Twitter for iPhone,924,4510

Here’s my analysis of this bill the two parties love: https://t.co/4Kl2AaOjkZ https://t.co/bZEl44Pfsq,2020-04-03 20:18:31,Twitter for iPhone,73,378

The math is a bit tricky so I think that’s why many people are not immediately seeing what’s going on here. A covered loan is 2.5x average monthly payroll. The covered period is 8 weeks. Compare the law to Mnuchin. https://t.co/EzHKA5P61i,2020-04-03 17:00:38,Twitter for iPhone,626,1761
@GRmedic7604 No he did. He unilaterally reduced the amount of loan forgiveness available. See the first tweet.,2020-04-03 16:41:51,Twitter for iPhone,8,53
To be clear Mnuchin’s change doesn’t help employees. Law says total pay can’t be reduced by more than 25% of an employee’s full quarter salary or wages. He doesn’t touch this.  Regardless Mnuchin has no authority to change laws. Congress legislates; executive officials execute.,2020-04-03 16:30:53,Twitter for iPhone,984,3580
It seems to have gone largely unnoticed that Mnuchin has unilaterally altered the Paycheck Protection Program to substantially reduce loan forgiveness. Law says a business can spend ~50% of the loan on nonpayroll and still receive full forgiveness; Mnuchin says not more than 25%.,2020-04-03 16:30:52,Twitter for iPhone,5334,10660
I’ve spent the past few weeks chatting with many business owners managers employees and independent workers. The recent law isn’t going to provide most of them the help they need—and that’s even if it can be implemented without significant problems. We need an immediate redo.,2020-04-02 20:00:37,Twitter for iPhone,178,1137
Furthermore the new law will be complex to administer requiring a lot of bureaucracy and paperwork that will delay or deny assistance and produce countless errors. There is considerable economic and social value to the simplicity and speed of universal monthly cash relief.,2020-04-02 20:00:36,Twitter for iPhone,173,1040
The law also provides robust unemployment benefits but this money would have been better spent on monthly payments to all Americans regardless of employment status. As structured it perversely makes employment a financial liability for many. We shouldn’t discourage employment.,2020-04-02 20:00:36,Twitter for iPhone,138,933
If substantial monthly cash payments had been provided to the people then businesses could make necessary adjustments to wages and hours without harming workers. This dynamic would allow them to keep more people employed while enhancing the long-term viability of the business.,2020-04-02 20:00:36,Twitter for iPhone,154,965
Small businesses will be eligible for loans to help them weather the storm but obtaining loan forgiveness means giving up flexibility. Some businesses can manage this but many others will stagnate at a time when they need to adapt. This will not benefit workers in the long run.,2020-04-02 20:00:36,Twitter for iPhone,121,797
Because most Americans are being told to stay home the centerpiece of the law should have been substantial monthly cash relief to the people. Instead much of the assistance was funneled to Mnuchin and the Federal Reserve mostly to boost large corporations at their discretion.,2020-04-02 20:00:35,Twitter for iPhone,356,1645
The recent coronavirus law may help some Americans find temporary relief but it is too slow wholly insufficient and riddled with bad incentives and unintended consequences. The law will exacerbate and prolong a devastating economic decline that will harm millions of people.,2020-04-02 20:00:35,Twitter for iPhone,1144,5279

@wreiddalton @JewDawg It’s not Keynesian; it’s not about stimulating demand. I’m a Hayekian libertarian. There’s been a shock partly caused by virus and partly caused by government.

@StambaughRyan @JewDawg There are good aspects and bad. I understand that small businesses need loans right now. It’s broad-based so it doesn’t have the problems of the $500B corporate welfare fund. Nonetheless I’m worried the program may not work as intended. It’s too complicated and too inflexible.,2020-04-01 05:07:22,Twitter for iPhone,1,15
@JewDawg Thanks. I mean a monthly payment during the pandemic and it can be more than $1200/month if you eliminate corporate welfare (Mnuchin’s picking winners and losers) and other unrelated items. This is like tax relief but given in advance and more universal and equal than usual.,2020-04-01 04:51:51,Twitter for iPhone,25,321

@JewDawg I assume you’re referring to my background in economics. The answer is simple: Central planning and complex interventions don’t work. Adaptability is key especially after a big shock. The best way to keep government out is a direct cash transfer—think of it as reverse taxation.,2020-04-01 04:24:13,Twitter for iPhone,98,992

@chrislhayes @Toure By taking labor costs off their hands during the crisis we can help businesses keep more people employed. With monthly cash relief coming to employees businesses can reduce wages without causing workers harm. They also can temporarily furlough rather than fire excess employees.,2020-03-31 21:48:31,Twitter for iPhone,53,376
@chrislhayes @Toure Let’s be clear that the Phase 3 law gives most businesses little more than a loan to pay employees for about 10 weeks. With that comes all sorts of bureaucracy and restrictions. With demand down businesses will have to let people go and then they won’t get loan forgiveness.,2020-03-31 21:34:08,Twitter for iPhone,61,400
@BishesBrew @chrislhayes @Toure I’ve talked to many restaurant owners and managers. For them food is a bigger expense but they face the same issue regarding employees. We can give the restaurant money to pay employees or we can give the employees money directly. The latter gives restaurants more flexibility.,2020-03-31 21:08:25,Twitter for iPhone,21,261
@chrislhayes @Toure Demand is down regardless of the approach. The biggest expense for most businesses is labor. Moreover businesses that are labor intensive are most impacted by the virus. The biggest help we can provide is to ensure their employees get through this period with the least harm.,2020-03-31 21:00:43,Twitter for iPhone,118,1378

Crenshaw has learned a lot from Donald Trump during his time in Congress.

One of the oddest takes is that the $500B fund is just loans for businesses “told to close” not corporate welfare.  1. Very few businesses “told to close” will get this aid.  2. A taxpayer-backed loan *is* corporate welfare. You assume the risk; a corporation gets the benefit.,2020-03-26 21:48:51,Twitter for iPhone,685,2831

Here’s the thing: Democrats and Republicans in Congress are the ones calling for $2+ trillion. If you’re going to spend that kind of money then the best way to do it by far is a direct cash transfer that otherwise keeps government out of the way. That’s the bottom line for me.,2020-03-25 18:55:51,Twitter for iPhone,788,4703
For $2 trillion we could double the figures below and give every family of four $7000 per month for three months.  This would be far more helpful to the people than the Senate bill.

@JonesJeff411 @rmayemsinger Of course my years of criticisms of the GOP are “politics as usual” because you don’t like my vote on a tax bill. I understand.

@GeneEric8 @jaketapper The government *partly* reimburses (via tax credit) businesses for the new emergency paid leave requirements but big companies are exempt from the requirements themselves not just the reimbursements.

Note two things Mnuchin just said in the press conference:  Paid leave applies only to small- and medium-sized businesses. Why did they exempt Wall Street companies?  The bill has errors and needs a “technical correction.” In other words it doesn’t work as drafted as I stated. https://t.co/5bcrFlyCLa,2020-03-14 17:08:07,Twitter for iPhone,558,2181

@JTMontgomery8 This is a common refrain but you’re confusing the House with the Senate. I don’t condone what the Senate did but in the House we had more than three days to review the final text of the tax bill. Three days is a far cry from 30 minutes.,2020-03-14 15:45:30,Twitter for iPhone,13,261
@Tam_Resist @LaurieA1770 They’re delivered as PDFs. Your presumption is wrong. Generally very few members of Congress have access to big legislation. We’re intentionally kept in the dark.

@LaurieA1770 The bill allows the secretary of labor to exempt businesses with fewer than 50 employees from paid emergency leave and FMLA requirements but it’s unclear how this will be implemented. Unlikely to work on a case-by-case basis (despite the text). Will it be all such businesses?,2020-03-14 06:56:34,Twitter for iPhone,37,398
@LaurieA1770 For businesses with fewer than 500 employees the government is supposed to reimburse a portion of the paid emergency leave and FMLA; however the reimbursement will be in the form of a delayed tax credit. That means some businesses may become insolvent in an economic downturn.,2020-03-14 06:52:42,Twitter for iPhone,60,598
@LaurieA1770 I’ll give you some examples.  Without time to confer with the drafters or others we couldn’t determine why businesses with 500 or more employees are exempt from the paid emergency leave and FMLA requirements. An improper Wall Street carveout or is there some other justification?,2020-03-14 06:48:48,Twitter for iPhone,135,1358

Almost every “reform” in the Patriot Act reauthorization is easily circumvented won’t affect the way the government currently does surveillance or does basically nothing at all.

Outlets must recognize how “fast but thin” reporting negatively impacts the legislative process and address this problem.

My point is not that these journalists are intentionally misreporting but rather that modern journalism is susceptible to dangerous shortcuts at a time when even greater dedication to precision is required because of rapid and widespread dispersion of news through social media.,2020-03-06 18:49:30,Twitter for iPhone,48,519

Given the media’s disregard for the text of legislation it’s hardly surprising my colleagues consistently don’t care about it either.

The 14th (my favorite amendment) requires states to uphold due process and the equal protection of the laws and it empowers Congress to remedy states’ violations of rights. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 for example was an appropriate response to state-mandated discrimination.,2020-03-06 18:48:13,Twitter for iPhone,47,516
As explained in a separate thread duplicative criminal laws inherently threaten civil liberties and civil rights. While the Constitution grants Congress only a narrow criminal power it also grants Congress a broad power to ensure equality before the law via the 14th Amendment.,2020-03-06 18:48:13,Twitter for iPhone,32,449
For example the bill enhances sentencing for the crime of conspiring to interfere with during or incident to a riot or civil disorder any person engaged in a business. Given racial and other inequities in criminal justice we should worry about the law’s disparate application.,2020-03-06 18:48:13,Twitter for iPhone,50,564
The bill’s main effect is to enhance max sentences for these crimes up to the death penalty in some cases—a punishment that millions of Americans myself included oppose. To the extent there are unjust sentences it’s likely that people of color will disproportionately suffer.,2020-03-06 18:48:13,Twitter for iPhone,46,644
In other words the bill doesn’t make anything newly criminal and doesn’t even target lynching. Contrary to the headlines it doesn’t make lynching a new federal hate crime. The bill simply labels a variety of existing crimes as lynching regardless of their connection to it.,2020-03-06 18:48:12,Twitter for iPhone,61,576
Unlike the original the revised bill does not establish any new criminality pertaining to lynching. Instead it cites an array of current federal crimes and states that conspiring to commit those crimes (which is already criminal under federal law) constitutes lynching.,2020-03-06 18:48:12,Twitter for iPhone,44,499
Every headline gets it wrong.  The original version of the bill *was* written specifically to make a new federal crime of lynching with a maximum sentence of life in prison. But House leaders replaced that bill with a substantially different version just days before the vote.,2020-03-06 18:48:12,Twitter for iPhone,52,525

It’s even more concerning here because the bill is framed as a protection for people of color yet it is the rights of people of color that have been disproportionately violated by our massive and unaccountable criminal justice system.,2020-02-27 01:50:07,Twitter for iPhone,139,1094

This undermines states’ experimentation with different approaches to criminal justice uses up the resources available for actual federal issues and encourages the expansion of the federal police force which is not nearly as accountable to the people as are local police.,2020-02-27 01:50:06,Twitter for iPhone,57,601
This allows state officials who don’t adequately address particular crimes to shift blame and avoid accountability.

The bill’s main effect is to make these conspiracies punishable to the same extent (or greater) as the underlying crimes some of which are punishable by death. We should abolish the death penalty not expand it to more crimes.,2020-02-27 01:50:05,Twitter for iPhone,148,1478
#HR35 criminalizes conspiracies to violate various federal criminal laws including many that are unrelated to lynching. But it’s already illegal to conspire to commit any federal crime so the acts this bill covers are already criminal.,2020-02-27 01:50:04,Twitter for iPhone,78,763
To be clear the bill does not make lynching a new federal hate crime. Murdering someone on account of their race or conspiring to do so is not legal under federal law. It’s already a federal crime and it’s already a hate crime.,2020-02-27 01:50:04,Twitter for iPhone,182,1197

Alan Dershowitz offered a proverbial Hail Mary—an ahistorical case for an impeachment standard unsupported by the Constitution’s text or the history of the impeachment power and one that does not exonerate the president. The Senate must reject it. https://t.co/SOtp9E4Sgj,2020-01-31 18:50:17,Twitter for iPhone,664,2465
As more damaging facts come out senators who vote against calling witnesses will have to explain why they refused to consider all available evidence when the case was before them.,2020-01-31 17:28:50,Twitter for iPhone,11766,50696
Abuse of power is impeachable. Impeachment trials have witnesses.  By rejecting these principles the Senate does lasting harm to our constitutional republic.,2020-01-31 04:05:59,Twitter for iPhone,17212,73518
The president’s lawyers call our Constitution’s carefully prescribed impeachment process “massive election interference” but they consider the president’s abuse of power to benefit his re-election just another day at the office.,2020-01-30 19:58:24,Twitter for iPhone,8053,27151
Under our Constitution the Senate has “the sole Power to try all Impeachments.” Senate Republicans’ repeated assertion that the House itself should have conducted the essential functions of a trial is an effort to undo the results of the 1787 constitutional convention.,2020-01-30 17:38:52,Twitter for iPhone,5040,15852
Americans want Congress to reclaim authority presidents have usurped to keep us in endless wars and enter new conflicts without approval. Stand with our Constitution. https://t.co/SpX1VVC0fI,2020-01-30 01:12:59,Twitter for iPhone,1734,7980
So that everyone is clear Trump’s team is simultaneously arguing that the House should enforce its subpoenas in court *and* that it is unconstitutional for a court to enforce the House’s subpoenas.,2020-01-29 19:58:45,Twitter for iPhone,17124,56005

Nice. @realDonaldTrump you might want to withdraw the veto threat your administration issued just two days ago against this legislation. https://t.co/yRosJBY6ZR,2020-01-29 15:52:31,Twitter for iPhone,843,3524
Not that they were great before but Republicans in Congress with very few exceptions totally stopped caring about this when Donald Trump became president. It’s shameful. https://t.co/MvIVeaFkBp,2020-01-29 06:12:47,Twitter for iPhone,3349,12576

Without witnesses it’s not an impeachment trial; it’s just a debate.,2020-01-28 23:24:49,Twitter for iPhone,8674,46922
The fact that President Trump and his legal team do not understand why it violates the Constitution for the president to solicit aid from a foreign power for personal gain does not immunize him from impeachment and removal.,2020-01-28 18:58:56,Twitter for iPhone,15684,69220
Alan Dershowitz wants senators to ignore the specific charges in the articles of impeachment and focus only on the headings which he calls deficient. The articles are not just the titles “Abuse of Power” and “Obstruction of Congress” but also the text describing the misconduct.,2020-01-28 02:36:09,Twitter for iPhone,5378,22222
Hunter Biden is like a lot of unimpressive people in public life including the Trumps—trading on his name for power. But if Trump believed an illegality occurred then why didn’t the administration open a proper DoJ investigation instead of pushing Ukraine for an announcement?,2020-01-27 22:56:41,Twitter for iPhone,13434,64304
The president’s legal team is advocating a degree of executive privileges and immunities that would swallow the impeachment power and establish an unconstitutional rule of executive supremacy.,2020-01-27 21:12:53,Twitter for iPhone,12950,45080
The defense team’s strategy rests on pretending that news doesn’t exist.,2020-01-27 20:26:19,Twitter for iPhone,5524,27783
One of the most disingenuous assertions President Trump’s defense team makes is that this is all about policy differences. Using public office for personal gain is not just a policy difference; it’s an abuse of power.,2020-01-27 18:28:46,Twitter for iPhone,5788,21649
The president lies twice in one short tweet.  The House did ask Bolton to testify. He declined at the direction of the White House.  It is up to the Senate not the House to try the case. A trial includes witnesses. https://t.co/L3jR8X0StV,2020-01-27 17:26:34,Twitter for iPhone,10852,35623

Seventy-five years ago today the Auschwitz concentration camp was liberated. During the Holocaust the Nazis systematically murdered six million Jews and millions of others.

Try to hold your laughter.  President Trump on why he doesn’t want Bolton to testify:  “What happens if he reveals what I think about a certain leader and it’s not very positive?” https://t.co/kPSiPTbErn,2020-01-26 23:50:16,Twitter for iPhone,6726,28535

The president has abused power for personal gain precisely as the Framers of the Constitution feared. To not remove him for such misconduct will embolden future executives to act in their own interests to the detriment of our republic. The impeachment power will be dead law.,2020-01-24 04:16:53,Twitter for iPhone,8668,33667
My friend @Judgenap has remained true to his principles:  “What is required for removal of the president? A demonstration of presidential commission of high crimes and misdemeanors of which in Trump's case the evidence is ample and uncontradicted.” https://t.co/kPfcKDCXcM,2020-01-24 02:56:40,Twitter for iPhone,1847,6663
Here’s an example of why I’ve fought against unconstitutional surveillance. But Trump and Obama GOP and Dem leaders have consistently opposed efforts to rein in FISA.

Substantial evidence Trump acted corruptly for personal gain: • Tasked Giuliani in a personal capacity to press Ukraine on Bidens • Did not open DoJ investigations; instead sought Ukraine’s *announcement* of investigations • Kept key administration officials out of the loop,2020-01-23 22:45:45,Twitter for iPhone,7692,25747
“We’re doing very well. I got to watch enough. I thought our team did a very good job.

It’s pretty simple @mattgaetz.  The high crime is using his public office to solicit the aid of a foreign government for personal gain.  The victim is society itself.  Hamilton lays out the principles of impeachment in Federalist No. 65. History will see the GOP ignored history. https://t.co/6WH7l5uZfQ,2020-01-22 22:38:54,Twitter for iPhone,18089,69034
