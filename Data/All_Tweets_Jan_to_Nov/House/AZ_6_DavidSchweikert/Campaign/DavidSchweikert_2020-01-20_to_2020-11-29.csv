Donate to Hiral Tipirneni or her votes won't be counted? That's ridiculous 🧐 https://t.co/HyejEIwz16 via @azcentral,2020-11-06 17:47:32,Twitter for iPhone,5,13
Sent a note to supporters yesterday afternoon thanking them for their support their vote and their friendship over these years.  #AZ06 #KeepArizonaRED #THANKYOU https://t.co/VMDeftAyD7,2020-11-05 15:40:14,Twitter Web App,7,26

13 years of dust? https://t.co/9fKMjVnJ9j,2020-11-02 22:04:14,Twitter Web App,19,37
Hope you enjoyed your visit to AZ-06 @hiral4congress we love tourists! https://t.co/qdTJo0DMsE https://t.co/Jmwezxa1NG,2020-11-02 17:23:12,Twitter Web App,26,71
Halloween is still a day away but Hiral Tipirneni is already in costume. @hiral4congress https://t.co/63Xu8iunZf,2020-10-30 19:12:09,Twitter Web App,32,73
The other evening I joined some really really impressive young people who are door knocking to keep Arizona RED - The excitement and enthusiasm was fantastic to see.    This is a reminder to please turn in your ballot ASAP!  And remind your friends and neighbors to as well! https://t.co/zCGCaPUkmJ,2020-10-27 19:15:37,Twitter Web App,11,41
This $100000 from @SpeakerPelosi should put to rest any lingering doubts that @hiral4congress is bought and paid for by Pelosi. https://t.co/1dNeXg7EB4,2020-10-24 01:19:14,Twitter Web App,61,82
“David’s focus on promoting policies that enhance the vitality of Arizona and the nation’s economy is needed now more than ever.”  Thank you @GlennHamer for your endorsement.

2 years ago Hiral Tipirneni told voters that AZ-08 was her “home” and that she was “committed” to it. Why would she abandon her home and run in AZ-06 where she doesn’t even live? @hiral4congress https://t.co/vNV2bNcqgU,2020-10-05 22:36:06,Twitter Web App,81,105
Heres what I like to see support on the right... and support on the left!  Working hard this weekend to get yard signs up - THANK YOU for those showing support! https://t.co/eW8EfLp7FG,2020-10-05 00:31:28,Twitter for iPhone,15,49
I’m meeting with our neighbors every day to talk about the importance of the upcoming election.    Let’s keep Arizona’s 6th district RED - can you help me?   https://t.co/Sk0m15FuWE https://t.co/aOMStNyHJA,2020-10-04 12:50:00,Twitter for iPhone,26,43
There’s a reason Hiral Tipirneni supports a “public option” for healthcare. Democrats call it the “glide path” to Medicare for All because its purpose is to make private insurance “die a drawn-out death.”,2020-10-02 20:42:45,Twitter Web App,24,31
The Apple Watch came out in 2015. Hiral Tipirneni hasn’t been an ER doc since 2007. Who is @hiral4congress trying to fool? https://t.co/ki9beTgG4v,2020-09-30 21:46:03,Twitter Web App,27,42
Even Hiral Tipirneni admitted she wasn’t an ER doc anymore. So why is she saying she's an ER doc again? @hiral4congress lying about your current job for votes isn't a good look. https://t.co/wn1KNPjkBt,2020-09-30 00:04:44,Twitter Web App,7,6
Hey @hiral4congress 2 years ago you got caught calling yourself an ER doc when you hadn’t been one in over 10 years. It's been 13 years now yet you’re calling yourself an ER doc again. What changed other than the district you’re running in? https://t.co/9W0kJnu8oL,2020-09-29 21:25:26,Twitter Web App,46,39
Now she’s running in AZ-06 a district she doesn’t live in and can’t even vote for herself in. It’s not surprising that Hiral Tipirneni supports massive tax hikes and dangerous border security policies for the voters of AZ-06: She doesn’t live here.,2020-09-23 20:27:28,Twitter Web App,10,26
2 years ago @hiral4congress said “We get asked a lot ‘Why are you running in this race? Why are you in this district [AZ-08]? Why don’t you go to another district?’ And my answer is: This is my home. This is my district [AZ-08].” https://t.co/cSOHUBBULG,2020-09-23 20:27:27,Twitter Web App,15,25
"It’s disingenuous. Hiral [Tipirneni] wants voters to believe she’s something other than who she really is: a former physician sued for malpractice." https://t.co/vCK0YI4kXq,2020-09-21 23:00:50,Twitter Web App,33,27
She called the tax cuts “horrendous” and “worrisome”. What’s really “worrisome” is that she wants to be your representative.,2020-09-17 22:07:47,Twitter Web App,5,15
$64 billion. In its first year Republican Tax Cuts in 2017 saved Americans $64 billion dollars on their Federal income taxes. The average family saw their tax burden reduced by over $2000 dollars. You’d think Americans everywhere would be proud. Not Hiral Tipirneni.,2020-09-17 22:07:46,Twitter Web App,21,37
Hiral Tipirneni is just too liberal for Arizona. Not only does she want to expand Obamacare she wants to put us on a path for Medicare for All. And she wants to pay for it all by raising YOUR taxes. https://t.co/cKbOklHTbn,2020-09-16 22:47:05,Twitter Web App,10,14
Is anyone surprised that Elizabeth Warren endorsed Hiral Tipirneni? Both want to nationalize healthcare raise your taxes and ban guns. Hiral Tipirneni isn’t just liberal she’s radically liberal.  https://t.co/MwOWgEd3BN,2020-09-16 00:03:01,Twitter Web App,25,35
The last thing we need is more taxes @hiral4congress.,2020-09-15 21:27:00,Twitter Web App,5,6
With comments like calling tax cuts “horrendous” it’s not surprising that Hiral Tipirneni opposes tax relief for Arizona families and small businesses. In fact it’s clear that she would raise both the federal and state income taxes as well as our payroll taxes. https://t.co/HP0c913c2D,2020-09-15 21:27:00,Twitter Web App,7,6
Today Joyce and I will take time to remember those who lost their lives victims of the terrorist attacks that took place 19 years ago.
