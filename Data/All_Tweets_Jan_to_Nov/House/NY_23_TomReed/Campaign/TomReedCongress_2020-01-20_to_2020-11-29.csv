Cuomo is blaming the CDC and @realDonaldTrump for the nursing home crisis but PolitiFact says his claim is “false.” The truth is no one forced him to implement certain nursing home policies. He chose to do so. https://t.co/59g284TSaJ,2020-06-17 15:12:57,Twitter Web App,3,5
Governor Cuomo’s disastrous bail reform law allows dangerous criminals to be released back onto our streets to commit more crimes. We MUST hold people accountable when the law is broken. The extremism must end! https://t.co/Ba2hspvRSg,2020-06-15 15:03:43,Twitter for iPhone,4,2
