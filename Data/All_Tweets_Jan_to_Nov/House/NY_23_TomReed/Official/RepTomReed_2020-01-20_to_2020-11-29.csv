Ridiculous! Why is @SyracuseU blocking @seanspicer from speaking while liberal speakers are welcomed with open arms? Very unfair.

Great piece as we think about preventing an outbreak of the coronavirus in the U.S.  "Americans naturally turn to the government when their health or physical security is at risk but a core U.S. strength is the breadth of its private medical resources." https://t.co/b4nvP8c5ro,2020-03-02 19:48:33,Twitter Web App,3,4
Many House Democrats are pushing a drug pricing plan which would HALT innovation for new cures.   With a vaccine for Coronavirus desperately needed isn’t it foolish for those on the other side of the aisle to go down this path? https://t.co/aqu6fq4Wl2,2020-02-27 17:52:16,Twitter Media Studio,8,28

WHAT HAPPENED TO THE 1ST AMMENDMENT?  The suppression of free speech is a huge problem on college campuses.   Why haven’t university administrators steped up to enforce sanctions against students who commit these acts?   Is it because they don’t support conservative free speech? https://t.co/YQO6FBOe0b,2020-02-14 13:18:42,Twitter for iPhone,7,13
I encourage the administration and Governor Cuomo to continue their dialog to resolve this matter as their public comments have indicated. I stand ready to assist. (4/4),2020-02-13 23:18:37,Twitter Web App,3,8
I am pleased to hear that Governor Cuomo recognizes this as a fact following his meeting with President Trump. As the home of 9/11 we must never forget its lessons. (3/4),2020-02-13 23:18:37,Twitter Web App,2,9

As I have personally expressed to many public officials over the past week New York must provide complete unfettered and real-time DMV data to Customs and Border Protection to keep our fellow New Yorkers and country safe. (1/4),2020-02-13 23:18:36,Twitter Web App,9,22
The unrecognized benefits of tax cuts are amazing:  ✅ 3% rise in wages – that is an extra $1500 for a household making $50000.  ✅ Utility rates dropping.  ✅ Opportunity zones boosting disenfranchised people out of poverty and creating new jobs in the  areas needed the most. https://t.co/JlN1QR2kK1,2020-02-13 20:37:19,Twitter Media Studio,100,284

The Green Light Law is dangerous. As someone who lived through 9/11 I am astonished how Governor Cuomo could disregard the words of the 9/11 Commission where they noted “For terrorists travel documents are as important as weapons.” (1/2),2020-02-06 16:53:03,Twitter for iPhone,52,99
