The number one priority of bipartisan Members of the House Armed Services Committee &amp; our military leadership is to ensure that we are protecting &amp; defending our men and women in uniform.   #TaxinTedra has opposed every single NDAA that strengthens our military.,2020-07-01 14:37:41,Twitter for iPhone,40,138

One of the most critical issues is investing in missile defense to counter our adversaries &amp; protect our troops &amp; the homeland.  #TaxinTedra opposed ECMD at Fort Drum.

#TaxinTedra shows she is unfit to serve is when asked about Russia:   “Cobb said she is not yet sure what she would do about Russia.”   This is an absolute embarrassment.   I have delivered specific policy results on the House Armed Services Committee to counter Russia.,2020-07-01 14:11:31,Twitter for iPhone,43,167
North Country voters remember that my Far-Left opponent publicly scorned @realdonaldtrump for visiting Fort Drum to honor the 10th Mountain Division &amp; sign the largest pay increase for our troops. #TaxinTedra opposed the bill putting our military readiness &amp; troops lives at risk.,2020-07-01 14:04:05,Twitter for iPhone,178,605

This is disappointing.   NYS fails to respond to proactive outreach to voluntarily donate ventilators.  NJ accepts 22.   Instead NY officials respond to the media that it’s more interested in “big game hunting” &amp; then attack the authenticity of the nursing home owner’s Twitter?👇 https://t.co/efUnuaPNdg,2020-04-07 11:34:29,Twitter for iPhone,181,549

Our team is always appreciative of your reporting @RobertHarding esp during this crisis.   But you are comparing totally different data points.   I’m saying 1.67% of statewide tests conducted have been in #NY21 counties.   Not the % of our population tested which is less. https://t.co/DmmeGg6Qcx,2020-04-06 13:46:38,Twitter for iPhone,29,142
According to the data from NYS COVID-19 tracker by county #NY21 counties only have received 1.67% of total tests statewide.   This is unacceptable.   New York is discussing shifting PPE &amp; ventilators yet we have only had 1.67% of total statewide tests!  Need more tests Upstate.,2020-04-06 12:38:53,Twitter for iPhone,222,983
Our #NY21 communities are stepping up.   We passed this along immediately to get approved by New York State.

Context here:  ETown Community Hospital has 2.   That’s right. TWO.   So yes I am opposed to shipping either 50% or 100% of the ventilators at ECH which serves an extremely elderly population with significant underlying health conditions. https://t.co/LC4ns2BGJn,2020-04-04 12:36:23,Twitter for iPhone,94,460

This faulty modeling off of disaster relief for “9/11” or a “Hurricane” is different than in a pandemic when there are simultaneous surges in different regions. It’s not just one isolated location.

#TaxinTedra flip-flopped on impeaching @realDonaldTrump AGAIN.

Once again Adam Schiff makes up dialogue of the President of the United States on the floor of the Senate.

Where was the mainstream media breathlessly questioning every single Dem Member:  “Why won’t you allow GOP to call additional witnesses?”  Crickets.   But when shoe is on other foot the media fails to report on the total &amp; absolute hypocrisy of Dems &amp; Schiff’s witness requests.,2020-01-20 23:16:58,Twitter for iPhone,2746,8065
🚨 On the much discussed issue of Democrat witness requests👇  Let’s be crystal clear.  During House Intel impeachment hearings Adam Schiff did NOT allow GOP to call a single witness that was not on the Dem list.   We formally requested additional witnesses &amp; were denied.,2020-01-20 23:13:28,Twitter for iPhone,5082,12801
