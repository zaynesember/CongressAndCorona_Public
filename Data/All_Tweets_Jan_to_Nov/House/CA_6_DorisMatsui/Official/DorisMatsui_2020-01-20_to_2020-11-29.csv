The Trump Administration’s cruel Public Charge rule goes into effect today. This is a blatant attempt to strike fear into immigrant communities. We must give families access to the right information so that they know their rights. https://t.co/uYHUZPy3yr https://t.co/1zi86YCyOj,2020-02-24 20:13:07,Twitter Web App,6,12

America will always be a country of diverse people ideas and communities so we must continue to honor those Japanese Americans who were stripped of their constitutional rights and imprisoned. We must continue to tell their stories.,2020-02-19 22:23:31,Twitter Web App,2,19
78 years ago today Executive Order 9066 incarcerated my family &amp; over 120000 other Americans in an act of fear – simply because of our ethnic heritage. The internment of Japanese Americans was an act of bigotry racism &amp; injustice that went against our founding principles.,2020-02-19 22:23:31,Twitter Web App,21,52

The @USWNT inspires young women and unites our country every time they take the field. Yet they still fight for #EqualPay. We must all band together to demand no less than what they deserve – equal pay for equal work. https://t.co/KdBgiZyLx2,2020-02-12 23:35:49,Twitter Web App,3,12

The updated Travel Ban continues the policy of separating families. We can't let these discriminatory rules continue under the guise of safety. That is why I am a co-sponsor of the No Ban Act which would rescind all versions of @POTUS’ hateful Muslim Ban. https://t.co/Pov7dOCPTL,2020-02-06 00:30:00,TweetDeck,8,17
No child in the world’s wealthiest nation should go to bed hungry or be without a safe affordable place to call home. Yet the President is gutting SNAP and dismantling fair housing. This is harming American families. We must fight to #ProtectKids.,2020-02-05 18:07:54,Twitter Web App,11,31

Every 3 seconds a food allergy reaction sends someone to the ER. By passing the FASTER Act (H.R. 2117) we can help improve the safety and lives of 32 million Americans living with food allergies. https://t.co/gqZN0khgkf,2020-01-29 20:10:51,Twitter Web App,12,26
Because of Trump’s #RemainInMexico just .01% of asylum seekers are reaching safety. Before this dehumanizing process 20% were granted asylum here in the US.
