Right now there could not be a clearer difference between a true transparent and empathetic leader like Joe Biden and the current occupant in the White House. It’s time for real leadership in the Oval Office and that’s why I am supporting Joe Biden for President. (2/2),2020-05-05 17:45:28,Twitter for iPhone,1,7
I am proud to endorse my good friend Joe Biden for President. I worked with Joe on including my Excellence in Mental Health Act in his Gun Violence Task Force.
