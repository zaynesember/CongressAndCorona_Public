When these difficult conversations come up people like to mention how far we've come as a country.  “Slavery ended 150 years ago” “We passed the Civil Rights Act” “Jim Crow is gone” “We elected a black President”   They argue that these somehow mean we are past racism. 4/5,2020-05-30 14:01:09,Twitter for iPhone,11,79
In these images African Americans see their children they see their loved ones they see themselves. Being Black in America means living with the fear that every interaction with law enforcement is a possible life or death situation. 3/5,2020-05-30 14:01:08,Twitter for iPhone,7,59
“I can’t breathe.”  The final words of Mr. Floyd echo those of Eric Garner and countless African Americans who have had their lives cut short or forever altered by the very people sworn to protect them.

George Floyd was murdered by four police officers as he begged for his life because of the color of his skin. Should they have been fired? Yes. Should they be prosecuted? Yes. But this isn’t a one-off incident. This has been happening since the dawn of our nation. 1/5,2020-05-30 14:01:08,Twitter for iPhone,45,305

Let’s all stop and think how messed up it is that the head of the VFW has to ask the President of the United  States for an apology for downplaying the impact of traumatic brain injuries on our troops. Esp after seeing the last 20 yrs of our soldiers pain from TBI/PTS https://t.co/SGt8RNR2rc,2020-01-25 05:55:26,Twitter for iPhone,179,409
Working Americans deserve a living wage and quality healthcare &amp; retirement benefits. That’s why I co-sponsored the Raise the Wage Act and why I’ve fought for plans like this one to bring good union jobs back to Northeast Ohio.,2020-01-24 23:32:00,TweetDeck,13,54
One of my top priorities in Congress is creating good jobs right here in our district. For too long our economic system has benefited the wealthy and left hard-working Americans behind.,2020-01-24 19:27:00,TweetDeck,2,22
This is very important!  Swing district Dems all coming to Biden. https://t.co/JF85xKO0gI,2020-01-24 15:59:30,Twitter for iPhone,14,34

This is hilarious. https://t.co/wZtbxDex32,2020-01-24 15:45:42,Twitter for iPhone,6,70
Unions are the backbone of the middle class. The 40-hour workweek minimum wage overtime pay and the workers’ safety provisions we now take for granted were won by labor. That’s why I’m proud to cosponsor the Right to Organize Act. #UnionStrong https://t.co/44khAdHd9W,2020-01-24 01:31:00,TweetDeck,18,63
Republicans across the US are attacking workers’ rights. We saw it here in Ohio with #SB5 a GOP bill that made it illegal for first responders &amp; other state employees to strike for better wages &amp; working conditions. I’m proud to stand up for working people. #UnionStrong https://t.co/RxANSuoVfO,2020-01-23 21:28:00,TweetDeck,14,36
This is so refreshing. Just hearing this lowers my blood pressure.  Decency matters. Let’s turn the page America. A President Biden can help us heal unite and rebuild America. https://t.co/cOZwEKs1aL,2020-01-23 12:54:20,Twitter for iPhone,37,178

Our brave men and women in uniform joined the service to protect our country and fight for freedom not to destroy humanity’s cultural heritage. Proud to sponsor this bill with Chairman @TeamEngel. #NoWarWithIran https://t.co/lHAFpJcJUx,2020-01-23 00:35:00,TweetDeck,11,28

Today in 1973 SCOTUS ruled that women have a Constitutional right to make their own decisions about their health and bodies. Now more than ever it's crucial that we fight to protect Roe and stop Republicans from rolling back reproductive rights. #7in10ForRoe #Roe47 https://t.co/weg5UaZfnf,2020-01-22 21:43:00,TweetDeck,8,24
This is why Joe Biden is going to be the President.  His heart is cutting through all the political noise.  He understands  people are hurting. He cares about us. He will help this country heal then unite then rebuild. Let’s go Joe! @JoeBiden  @JoeNBC @morningmika @iowademocrats https://t.co/ZjQUy1T3eB,2020-01-22 20:55:47,Twitter for iPhone,399,1891
Huge Deal!!! Labor is starting to coalesce around the VP. This is big for early states but even bigger for the General election in the key industrial states.  ⁦@JoeBiden⁩ ⁦@Morning_Joe⁩ ⁦@robertwolf32⁩  https://t.co/5om4dHrMVD,2020-01-22 16:55:55,Twitter for iPhone,53,150
Ten years ago today the Supreme Court issued its disastrous #CitizensUnited decision which allowed big corporations and special interest groups to pour unlimited money into politics. It’s no coincidence that our political system is not working for working people.,2020-01-21 22:33:00,TweetDeck,38,120
Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was a moral giant who had the courage to imagine a better America. Today almost 52 years after his murder we’re still fighting for his dream of racial and economic justice. #MLKDay,2020-01-20 19:32:00,TweetDeck,6,30
