Brought to you by the Administration that brags about kicking people off SNAP… Now they want to institute Medicaid block grants. That means lower quality care for fewer people. And the people who lose out? The most vulnerable of our friends and neighbors. Just despicable. https://t.co/90xDtqNe9S,2020-02-06 22:03:01,Twitter Web App,50,104

The President spent the first half of his #SOTU speech talking about how great the economy is for American workers but if that’s true why are so many Ohioans working 2 or 3 jobs and struggling to make ends meet?,2020-02-05 02:28:08,TweetDeck,1786,6167
This is immoral. This should not be a reality in our country. No matter where you’re at on the political spectrum lower drug costs is something we can all agree on.

After the recent Iran debacle it’s clear this president has no qualms about dragging us into war whenever he sees fit. That’s why I voted to repeal the 2002 AUMF.

It's just breathtaking. AT&amp;T will net upwards of $42 billion from the corporate tax cut Republicans jammed through in 2017. And since then AT&amp;T has cut nearly 42000 employees. This. Is. Not. Okay.,2020-01-30 15:55:08,Twitter Web App,47,102

34 US troops treated for TBI after Iran’s Jan 8 missile attack. 18 were medically evacuated.
