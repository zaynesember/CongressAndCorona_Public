I've fought to protect the Affordable Care Act and its protections for folks w/ pre-existing conditions and ban on lifetime caps.

In addition to a 95% bipartisan rating my work to pass the USMCA trade agreement was cited as one of the key reasons the @USChamber endorsed me in this election. https://t.co/3dkNXJzdbv,2020-10-22 17:19:32,TweetDeck,3,24

In more false attacks Ms. Collins claims I voted to cut police funding. This lie has already been debunked by @dallasnews.
