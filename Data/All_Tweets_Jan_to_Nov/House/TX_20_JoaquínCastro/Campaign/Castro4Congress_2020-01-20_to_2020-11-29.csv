For people who are wondering why the mail ballot count is mostly favoring Democrats — it’s because Donald Trump demonized mail voting and told his supporters to vote in person.   Plus more Democrats have been concerned about catching COVID-19 by voting in person. #Biden2020,2020-11-05 21:13:34,Twitter for iPhone,83,442
