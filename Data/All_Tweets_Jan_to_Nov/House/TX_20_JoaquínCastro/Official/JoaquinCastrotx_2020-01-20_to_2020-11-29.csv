In the last 2 yrs 98% of people pulled over by a Fort Bend officer were Latino—94% of searches found nothing.

I’m so glad that @OLLUnivSATX is working with the The National Institute of Mexican American History of Civil Rights to tell and preserve the story of Mexican Americans in Texas. San Antonio is the perfect home for this institute and for these stories.  https://t.co/znJt7viknd,2020-01-21 19:01:24,Twitter Web App,7,32
I was so proud to take part in this year’s #MLK March in San Antonio—every year our march is one of (if not) the biggest in the entire country. Our community has always believed in Dr. King’s dream as we carry his torch and continue to fight for true equality. #MLKDay https://t.co/HKWKfu4JNd,2020-01-21 01:34:02,Twitter for iPhone,80,611
Despite the darkness and injustice we see and feel around us Martin Luther King Jr.’s legacy of unity virtue and service continues to inspire all of us to imagine and fight for a more equitable world and a more just country. Love can—and love will—drive out hate. #MLKDay,2020-01-20 18:43:41,Twitter for iPhone,43,229
