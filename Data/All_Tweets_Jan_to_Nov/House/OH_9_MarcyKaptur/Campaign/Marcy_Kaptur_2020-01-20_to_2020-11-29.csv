Every state has its own Trump broken promise. For Ohio it's Lordstown and steel jobs in communities like Lorain. In Michigan it's Ford Romeo and Flatrock. For Indiana Carrier. For Wisconsin it's Foxconn. His word can't be trusted.  https://t.co/2RVsTtGNrM,2020-10-23 20:00:48,Twitter for Android,13,21

The American people sent Donald Trump to the White House to drain the swamp. Instead he's become Mitch Mcconnell's lackey. https://t.co/vkDY0r25uY,2020-10-06 22:44:14,Twitter for Android,3,5
Our brave servicemen and women put their lives on the line for liberty each day. They see through a man who avoided service and regularly denigrates the service of men like John McCain. https://t.co/ch67TFGFfW,2020-08-31 22:15:58,Twitter for Android,1,2
The American people are smart enough not to boycott an institution that employs thousands of hardworking Ohioans. The boycott of President Trump in November will send him home.  https://t.co/hxENZfP4Xc,2020-08-20 01:07:20,Twitter for Android,1,3
If it weren’t for the failed leadership of Donald Trump and Republicans like Jim Jordan America would have college football AND a comprehensive testing and tracing program going into the school year. https://t.co/Oqp1QRDLKR,2020-08-10 20:23:05,TweetDeck,3,9
President Trump ran on his ability to negotiate. As millions of Americans stand to lose a financial safety net against COVID he spent his day undermining elections and tweeting about pizza. https://t.co/PLzev0SbNY,2020-07-30 21:01:22,TweetDeck,9,16
Mr. Meadows Democrats passed the HEROES Act to extend unemployment relief for those suffering economic hardship due to President Trump's failures. There's no GOP bill. Who’s really standing in the way? https://t.co/wBEHPZMwcm,2020-07-23 15:35:34,TweetDeck,1,4
While unemployment surges and many Americans face food insecurity the president brags about spending $3 billion+ on new planes because he doesn't like the televisions. Our nation deserves better. https://t.co/k4R1n4QqCi,2020-06-23 13:21:42,TweetDeck,4,7
Lightning speed. Trump moved faster to protect his dangerous Twitter rants from one fact check than he did to protect the American people from a global pandemic. https://t.co/UavrZh3veA,2020-05-28 23:37:43,TweetDeck,1,4

Mitch McConnell's message: our states and localities are on their own enjoy bankruptcy.  The President Trump message: injecting bleach might be the right move.   The lives of Americans hang in the balance and demand seriousness. This is unacceptable.,2020-04-24 16:02:16,TweetDeck,142,506

Asking millions of senior citizens to file taxes when they are generally not required to do so in the middle of a deadly pandemic is shameful. Reverse course and save lives Mr. President. https://t.co/RmYtpNf8Ch,2020-04-01 19:27:33,TweetDeck,1,3
It pains me to say it as the elected representative of many Cleveland Cavaliers fans but Steve Kerr is exactly right. Please fill out the census it's a vital step to help bring resources to our community. https://t.co/vjfkPB7cLJ,2020-04-01 18:01:04,TweetDeck,4,17
After the biggest tax cut to corporations in history (with few jobs and exploding deficits to show for it) now a no-strings attached bailout for Wall Street darlings? American workers must come first. https://t.co/3xh2YwOGLM,2020-03-24 00:21:29,TweetDeck,1,1
Two weeks later the president's dangerous rhetoric and lies continue to put Americans at risk. Scientists must be center stage we need testing and we need to equip our health care professionals for what is coming. https://t.co/KAVJLh61NJ,2020-03-19 17:39:25,TweetDeck,0,0

This is dangerous and could lead to the loss of more life. We need our scientific and health communities on the same page as our elected officials. This is not the time for games. https://t.co/B7Jh3lbP0L,2020-03-05 14:33:34,TweetDeck,1,5

We've seen this Republican bait and switch before. Massive tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy and cuts to programs you've spent your life paying into to pay for them.   I don't believe the American people will buy it. https://t.co/Nv5QjkcZdT,2020-02-10 18:09:45,TweetDeck,2,4
The President submits a budget to congress each year and his most recent one included cuts to Social Security Medicare and Medicaid. I'm not taking the president's word on this.   I reject the use of the word "entitlements" for programs Americans pay into their whole lives. https://t.co/u8pLp9cD9f,2020-01-24 14:23:43,TweetDeck,3,6
