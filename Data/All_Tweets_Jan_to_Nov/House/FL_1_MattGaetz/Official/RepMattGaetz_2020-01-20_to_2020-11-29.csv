Dems are attaching war powers language to a COMMEMORATIVE COIN bill instead of allowing for a fair &amp; honest debate.  That is NOT how Congress should address military force authorization https://t.co/IF0uK80nEl,2020-01-28 21:03:17,Twitter Media Studio,729,2344
All of the "evidence" against President @realDonaldTrump can be categorized as one of three things:   1. Hearsay 2. Speculation and presumption 3. A policy disagreement  None of these things are impeachable. https://t.co/hyN1FBSqQi,2020-01-28 19:46:07,Twitter Media Studio,3600,11059
Mayor Randall Wise was a devoted public servant and a fixture in our Northwest Florida community.

.@RepAdamSchiff lied when he misrepresented the Ukraine call transcript.  He lied when he said there was more than circumstantial evidence on the Russia probe.   He's been lying for days on the floor of the United States Senate.  Can we at least remove him from the Gang of Eight? https://t.co/ZAxLH3yCfa,2020-01-28 14:54:43,Twitter Media Studio,4241,12844

Wednesday: @Twitter censors our pro-life video as "sensitive content."  Today: @Twitter censors ANOTHER pro-life video our office created AND censors @TeamTrump's pro-life video.  This is unacceptable. We need answers. https://t.co/GD1kGabFhe,2020-01-24 18:14:37,Twitter Web App,1226,2402

While factually flawed and full of holes House Managers *did* create ostensibly compelling moments clips and memes.   @POTUS deserves the very best defense against this impeachment-via hearsay conjecture and policy disagreement. (2/3),2020-01-24 17:33:06,Twitter Web App,223,1131
The great irony is that while @RepAdamSchiff falsely accuses @realDonaldTrump of undermining elections with legitimate long-held concerns about Ukraine foreign aid and corruption he is the one prosecuting this #shamimpeachment to pollute the 2020 election.

Twitter flagged our #prolife video on the anniversary of #RoevWade as "potentially sensitive content" and blocked it from auto-play.   We won't be silenced.  WATCH and SHARE to spread the truth about #abortion. https://t.co/vNvKxONsiT,2020-01-22 17:49:24,Twitter Web App,260,533
America is not just an idea or documents or even values.   America is our home. And we must protect our home.   We must protect the water the air the creatures the land and its borders.

Our inalienable rights as humans begin in the womb.   They are not altered by a flawed court decision like #RoevWade and our intrinsic value is not dependent upon public opinion.   Every heartbeat has a purpose – and we choose to acknowledge it.  We choose life. https://t.co/M0fkItXYtz,2020-01-22 15:38:59,Twitter Media Studio,1036,3350

Instead of working with Republicans to create trade deals secure our border and advance policies that will put the American people first Democrats are trying to develop new articles of impeachment.   Apparently they didn’t have enough fun the first time around. https://t.co/KgwRuSuoFr,2020-01-20 16:40:47,Twitter Media Studio,2468,8835
Floridians deserve the benefits of E-Verify: higher wages increased job security and a safe legal workforce.
