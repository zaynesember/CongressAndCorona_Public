Bring a Nazi Sympathizer is such a horrible thing.  It shouldn’t be trivialized so you can feel good about smearing someone’s politics.  Nazi’s killed millions of people.

@maggieNYT @jdawsey1 I was never “ousted.”  During impeachment I spoke to the President regularly (almost daily).  I reckon it’s easier for Maggie Haberman to deem a fictional “ouster” concluded than to simply acknowledge that @jdawsey1’s reporting was exaggerated poorly sourced or wrong.  #FakeNews,2020-02-11 06:35:06,Twitter for iPhone,31,115
