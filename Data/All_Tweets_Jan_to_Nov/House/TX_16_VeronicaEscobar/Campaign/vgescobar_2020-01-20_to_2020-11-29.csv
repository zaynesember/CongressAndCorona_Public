And even if we disregard the racially charged nature of the tweet &amp; the use of the word “invasion” it’s clear that Trump's taxpayer-funded DHS crew (@DHS_Wolf @HomelandKen and now @CBPMarkMorgan) are using their govt positions to send a message 6 days away from the election.,2020-10-28 20:39:04,Twitter Web App,7,33
.@realDonaldTrump's racism &amp; xenophobia put a target on our back fueling the violence inflicted on us that day. And his embrace of white nationalism has fueled the increase of hate crimes across our country.  Morgan is using his govt-funded bully pulpit to mirror Trump's words.,2020-10-28 20:39:04,Twitter Web App,8,39
Morgan refused saying we can't “cancel” the word "invasion" b/c of sensitivities around its use.   On August 3 2019 a domestic terrorist confessed that he drove over 600 miles to massacre Mexicans and immigrants who were part of an “invasion.” The bloodshed was fueled by racism.,2020-10-28 20:39:04,Twitter Web App,11,53
THREAD: I've said the only way to hold racism to account is to call it out.   I’m calling out @CBPMarkMorgan.   After seeing this tweet identifying migrants as an “invasion” I reached out to him asking that he recognize the connotations of the word “invasion” and delete it. https://t.co/be3wMVzrra,2020-10-28 20:39:03,Twitter Web App,60,165

We know why Trump thinks voting by mail is “horrible.” He basically said Republicans would lose if Americans had fair &amp; convenient mail-in ballots.  While he doesn’t want all Americans to enjoy this convenience he doesn’t mind it for himself.  We all deserve the same privilege. https://t.co/qlru5eaejI,2020-04-08 11:49:30,Twitter for iPhone,86,244

I think many of us would categorize @GovAbbott's decision to avoid a statewide stay-at-home order as cowardly (akin to Trump's putting business interests ahead of human life) instead of a signal of "trust in local officials whose judgment he has questioned in the past." https://t.co/LPdWldlUqU,2020-03-27 23:40:08,Twitter Web App,8,26

I served in local government for a little over a decade.  In that time my local "establishment" worked against me.
