I’m afraid we now live in a very different country than we did 3 yrs ago.  And frankly it’s @realDonaldTrump’s fault. The blame rests on the shoulders of his enablers.  When there are powerful witnesses to a crime who explain that crime away then we no longer have rule of law. https://t.co/nCipyGawe7,2020-01-31 00:20:11,Twitter for iPhone,103,360
The horror grows.  It’s not enough that Spanish-speaking Central Americans waiting for their day in US court are sent to MX where they are extorted sexually assaulted &amp; kidnapped.   Now the US is sending Brazilian migrants who don’t speak Spanish there too.  And he rejoices👇🏽 https://t.co/e9BA7G7Dsx,2020-01-30 21:28:33,Twitter for iPhone,229,471

This attack against our core values should not stand.   President Trump and the architects of the anti-American #RemainInMexico policy must be held accountable for eroding our asylum laws and creating a new criminal ecosystem across our border.  https://t.co/uf7CDBFe39,2020-01-30 00:57:10,TweetDeck,77,139

Today marks one year since the implementation of @realDonaldTrump’s horrendous #RemainInMexico policy which deprives asylum seekers of due process and endangers their safety and well-being.  It's time for Congress to #DefundMPP and put an end to this cruelty. #RestoreAsylumNow https://t.co/myTi4Sydwo,2020-01-29 19:01:00,Twitter Media Studio,295,667
50 American service members suffered traumatic brain injuries after the Iranian missile strikes.   @realDonaldTrump has yet to apologize for his disgusting remarks dismissing the severity and danger of these invisible war wounds.

Three years ago today @realDonaldTrump issued the outrageous Muslim ban impacting millions of families across the U.S. and abroad.  We must continue our fight against the expansion of this xenophobic and anti-immigrant policy and pass the #NoBanAct now.  https://t.co/wIaQgkvG1n,2020-01-27 20:24:40,TweetDeck,24,71
This SCOTUS public charge ruling disproportionately affects communities like El Paso and hurts the American Dream.   No one should be forced to choose between the wellbeing of their families and their future. https://t.co/Xb6rvgVC11,2020-01-27 19:26:06,Twitter for iPhone,52,111
The horrors of the Holocaust began with the dehumanization of people.
