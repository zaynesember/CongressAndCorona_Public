Limiting family &amp; friends sitting around the table this Thanksgiving is hard. But it’s a small sacrifice compared to that of our doctors &amp; nurses fighting this surge.

Gentlemen this may be the thing you are remembered for.   Please defend our democracy.,2020-11-19 18:32:38,Twitter Web App,1126,8946
History has come for Speaker Chatfield and Senator Shirkey who have been summoned to the White House ahead of Monday’s State Board of Canvassers' meeting meant to certify Michigan’s results.  These two men will soon have to choose between our democracy and fealty to one man.,2020-11-19 18:32:38,Twitter Web App,7358,27488
With a step-daughter in the Army I'm all for drawing down our wars. But do it right and preserve our friendships so we can fight another day.,2020-11-18 02:07:39,Twitter Web App,21,299
The fact that our NATO allies who came to our defense after 9/11 and who have fought and died with us were not consulted before this decision breaks faith with that commitment and simply means we will be less likely to be able to rally partners to our cause in the future.,2020-11-18 02:07:39,Twitter Web App,54,324
The American handshake has to mean something. It is our word and our bond.   If we ask allies and partners to fight alongside us we are committing to be there for each other to fight common threats.,2020-11-18 02:07:38,Twitter Web App,18,174
In the short term the quick timeline opens up the risk of attack of disorganization and provides an opportunity to our enemies.  But in the long-run it may be even more harmful.,2020-11-18 02:07:38,Twitter Web App,15,136
Today the acting Sec. Def. announced a quick withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan &amp; Iraq. Whatever one's views making such a quick move without coordination with our NATO Iraqi and Afghan allies after so much blood has been shed hurts us in both the short and long-term.,2020-11-18 02:07:38,Twitter Web App,286,1220
This is contrary to the President’s claims and of many in my own state. I applaud the professionals at CISA including Chris for telling the truth. Whether these types of firings have a goal or they’re simply punitive one thing is clear: our country will be less safe for them.,2020-11-13 01:17:08,Twitter for iPhone,21,141
As CISA and election officials said in a statement tonight “the November 3rd election was the most secure in American history” with “no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes changed votes or was in any way compromised.”,2020-11-13 01:17:08,Twitter for iPhone,26,146
On the Homeland Security Committee I’ve seen Chris Krebs in action and repeatedly questioned him on election and cyber security issues.   He’s a professional and a public servant who has done critical work to safeguard our elections and stop the spread of misinformation. https://t.co/YKeZ5NKPO4,2020-11-13 01:17:07,Twitter for iPhone,67,272

Today on #VeteransDay and every day we honor our veterans not just with words but with action.

In the coming months we’ll have to continue to fight hard for those protections and find other ways to enshrine them in law.  I hope my colleagues who profess support for these protections are ready to vote differently this time around. Lots of lives depend on it.,2020-11-10 14:08:44,Twitter for iPhone,12,105
Republicans &amp; Democrats alike profess to support protections for people with pre-existing conditions. But this lawsuit could undo those protections with the stroke of a pen.   The Trump Admin could have left them intact but doubled down on invalidating them in a global pandemic.,2020-11-10 14:08:44,Twitter for iPhone,26,112
I’m thinking of the 51% of Michiganders who like her happen to have a pre-existing condition and could again be gouged for coverage; and I’m thinking of the 720000 Michiganders who could lose coverage outright if this lawsuit succeeds.,2020-11-10 14:08:44,Twitter for iPhone,9,63
Today as the Supreme Court hears the Trump Administration’s oral arguments seeking to strike down the entire Affordable Care Act I’m thinking of my mom.

All leaders must decide what they will do in the next 72 days.  I strongly urge Acting Secretary Miller to remember that the country and the military he has dedicated his life to are counting on him to do the right thing.,2020-11-09 19:21:57,Twitter Web App,118,786
It is critical that he and all senior Pentagon leaders remember that they swore an oath to the Constitution not any one man.  With that oath comes a commitment to the peaceful transition of power.,2020-11-09 19:21:56,Twitter Web App,111,698
I did not always agree with Secretary Esper but I always knew that he cared deeply for our men and women in uniform. I worked with Acting Secretary of Defense Chris Miller during my time at the Pentagon and more recently during his time at the National Counterterrorism Center.,2020-11-09 19:21:56,Twitter Web App,45,436
Whatever the reason casting aside a Secretary of Defense during the volatile days of transition seems to neglect the President’s most important duty: to protect our national security.,2020-11-09 19:21:56,Twitter Web App,109,717
A second would be vindictiveness which would be an irresponsible way to treat our national security.  A third would be because the President wants to take actions that he believes his Secretary of Defense would refuse to take which would be alarming.,2020-11-09 19:21:55,Twitter Web App,137,820
In my experience there would only be a few reasons to fire a Secretary of Defense with 72 days left in an Administration.  One would be incompetence or wrongdoing which do not seem to be the issue with Secretary Esper.,2020-11-09 19:21:55,Twitter Web App,434,1610
If you remain silent you are complicit.  I am not asking my colleagues to support Joe Biden. I am asking you to stand up for our country.,2020-11-06 00:59:48,Twitter Web App,440,2797
Cabinet officials need to signal clearly and publicly that they will not aid the president’s attempts to undermine our elections.  Senior Republican elected officials need to speak out now to make clear they will not participate in attempts to thwart the will of the voters.,2020-11-06 00:59:48,Twitter Web App,286,1882
History is presenting a real test for the people who have downplayed the president’s anti-democratic words and deeds.  Leaders can no longer dodge their responsibilities to our democracy. These responsibilities are bigger than one man or any one party.,2020-11-06 00:59:48,Twitter Web App,456,3048
President Trump has been telling us for six months that he would contest the election if he didn’t win.  Now that we’re here it is time for every leader from the President’s cabinet to local elected officials here in Michigan to choose: fealty to President Trump or democracy.,2020-11-06 00:59:48,Twitter Web App,1954,9932

Just before COVID I brought together AG Nessel the FBI and community leaders to talk about the nearly four-fold increase in anti-Semitic incidents we were seeing in our state.

These are not hard questions and the CJCS and Secretary of Defense have already responded to my similar questions.  This is about the integrity of our institutions the bones that hold up our democracy.  I sincerely hope @DHS_Wolf comes back to us with a response in short order.,2020-10-22 19:05:37,Twitter Web App,6,35
It is reasonable to ask DHS in general and Acting Secretary Wolf specifically to reassure the American public that they will abide by their responsibility to protect the homeland –– not any one president –– in the days leading up to and following the election.,2020-10-22 19:05:30,Twitter Web App,2,38
Since June DHS has inserted federal troops into U.S. cities without consent from local officials used unmarked security forces operating under an opaque chain of command and have politicized intelligence on Russian efforts to influence our political process.,2020-10-22 19:05:10,Twitter Web App,2,12
I asked these questions in the first place because in recent months DHS has demonstrated their willingness to act as a political entity rather than an apolitical law enforcement and intelligence organization:,2020-10-22 19:05:07,Twitter Web App,1,7
A month ago I submitted questions to @DHS_Wolf asking him to commit to uphold DHS’ apolitical role in the upcoming election.  DHS tells us they may not respond until after the election –– defeating the purpose of such questions &amp; ignoring their urgency. https://t.co/8bb38tIX2I,2020-10-22 19:05:04,Twitter Web App,25,71
That is why I sent a letter to @DNI_Ratcliffe asking him &amp; career intel officials to brief Congress on the full spectrum of election threats and for him to provide public testimony so that the American people can understand his analysis: https://t.co/wDeaTxMfIo,2020-10-22 15:28:10,Twitter Web App,19,74
The DNI's announcement on Iran and Russia confirms what has long been apparent. Foreign actors remain persistent and effective in sowing distrust and division.  Because the threat of misinformation and division is so great clarity and transparency on these threats is critical.,2020-10-22 15:28:10,Twitter Web App,27,129
We must pass a bipartisan COVID relief package into law.   The people of Michigan are doing their part to weather these public health and economic crises and Washington should do the same. https://t.co/mulMlUvYUR,2020-10-21 18:58:05,Twitter Web App,19,89

Our law enforcement and intelligence agencies have been warning us about the growing threat of domestic violent extremism.  If there's one thing these arrests have shown us it's that we need to take those threats seriously. https://t.co/Xubzb8GIpQ,2020-10-12 14:55:05,Twitter Web App,33,134
I believe there is still a right and wrong. This plot is wrong.   And it’s incumbent on all of us to stand up to oppose this behavior and these growing threats.,2020-10-08 19:04:56,Twitter Web App,33,269
Leadership climate is set at the top –– starting with the Oval Office –– and leaders have a moral responsibility to set the example for how we disagree without enabling hate and violence.  Not just when something like today’s events happen but every day.,2020-10-08 19:04:56,Twitter Web App,46,275
They have purposely stoked it in a misguided attempt to appease their alleged base.  These same leaders should not now feign surprise that some extremists have turned such rhetoric into action.,2020-10-08 19:04:56,Twitter Web App,29,206
And importantly it shows that extreme rhetoric and stoking tensions have a very specific cost.  Elected leaders in Michigan and Washington alike have encouraged and tolerated threats of violence and hate against those with whom they disagree.,2020-10-08 19:04:55,Twitter Web App,31,227
Today’s arrests confirm again that they are right and should be a wake-up call to anyone who uses the same violent incitement as the accused or refuses to speak out against it.,2020-10-08 19:04:55,Twitter Web App,29,216
Both here in the state and on the Homeland Security Committee our law enforcement and intelligence agencies have been warning us with increasing urgency about the threat of violent domestic extremism.,2020-10-08 19:04:55,Twitter Web App,33,229
If true they are cowards and criminals and should be treated accordingly.  Make no mistake: This is about as far from their proclaimed patriotism as one can get. This is terrorism.,2020-10-08 19:04:55,Twitter Web App,34,306
I am deeply disturbed to hear of the plot conducted in part in my own district to kidnap our Governor.  I’m so thankful to federal state and local law enforcement for taking the threat seriously and getting to the perpetrators before they could act.,2020-10-08 19:04:54,Twitter Web App,387,2504
After reading the intel and without revealing classified info I’m concerned @DNI_Ratcliffe is seeking to distract from the threat Russia poses to our democratic process.

The people of Michigan are doing their part to weather these public health and economic crises and the President should do the same.,2020-10-06 20:58:48,Twitter Web App,8,69
Doing so does not serve the needs of the Michigan families and our small businesses it places himself above the needs of the country and it’s out of step with the mission of government –– which is to help in moments of crisis.,2020-10-06 20:58:48,Twitter Web App,10,63
I cannot understand why the President would halt negotiations until after the election except in a cynical move to secure votes.,2020-10-06 20:58:48,Twitter Web App,10,78
Three weeks ago 25 Democrats and 25 Republican members of the Problem Solvers Caucus urged leaders to get back in a room and negotiate a COVID relief deal that our communities desperately need.

During this once-in-a-generation crisis the need to put politics aside to get help to the people who need it has never been more important.

Leaders on both sides of the aisle achieved this five times in the spring so I urge all sides to get this done again for the American people despite the election season.,2020-10-01 16:12:22,Twitter Web App,7,31
That’s what leadership has done and I urge my own leadership in the House as well as the Senate and White House to put in all necessary effort to come to another bipartisan deal.,2020-10-01 16:12:21,Twitter Web App,4,21
People in Michigan are desperate for Congress to do its job and pass a bipartisan COVID relief bill.

President Trump’s exhortation of the Proud Boys to “stand back and stand by” may have been the first time many Americans have heard of this group.

The President can’t successfully refuse to accept the results of the election without a number of very senior officials aiding him.   It is those officials along with many others involved in administering elections that will determine what happens after November 3rd.,2020-09-24 01:34:33,Twitter Web App,150,617
And if he loses it will be up to those around him to either support his claims or step back.

Today the President again cast doubt on whether he would accept the results of the election if he doesn’t win.  He has been saying this since July.  He has laid the groundwork to refuse the peaceful transition of power.,2020-09-24 01:34:32,Twitter Web App,727,2761
These are some key questions I would ask Mr. Wolf at his hearing today which I’ve officially sent to him for the record: https://t.co/2fDcVEGMxy   Just as with our military DHS must be apolitical in our November election not used as a tool for the President’s political gain.,2020-09-23 14:57:23,Twitter Web App,13,40

During his Senate confirmation hearing today Acting Secretary @DHS_Wolf should commit to uphold @DHSgov's apolitical role — focused on protecting our country as is its mandate not protecting any one president.,2020-09-23 14:57:23,Twitter Web App,29,113

Today in a time of division I hope this anniversary reminds us of lessons from that day: that fear &amp; anger are powerful but not as powerful as courage &amp; unity.

And even though the President doesn’t have the authority to postpone the election the self-serving nature of his comments &amp; the way they upend the very tenets of what it means to be American is so disheartening.  Our elections aren’t about you Mr. President. They’re about us.,2020-07-30 15:25:21,Twitter Web App,23,99
It's disturbing for three reasons:   First the punch-in-the-gut it provides to see that the Commander in Chief is seeking to undermine the very institutions that make us the United States as laid out in the Constitution.

In passing this amendment today the House sent a bipartisan message that we need a full accounting of the threats Russia poses.  This is particularly important as the President continues to engage regularly with President Putin and seeks to move the relationship closer.,2020-07-21 23:47:59,Twitter Web App,238,951
But more importantly I believe it’s critical that the public be aware of the myriad ways the Russians are constantly attempting to undercut thwart and counter us abroad and at home.

On 7/10 FPS told the Homeland Security Committee that visible agency ID is typically required for DHS officers &amp; that they had checked to make sure officers were complying with this requirement when policing protests.   But it appears that requirement wasn't followed in Portland.,2020-07-19 20:53:26,Twitter Web App,30,73

Our competitive advantage as a country is based on the idea that the best &amp; brightest in the world want to make it in the U.S. Not China. Not Russia. Here.

Now this newest court ruling says Enbridge must provide more information on recent damage to Line 5.  Given how devastating a leak from Line 5 would be to our Great Lakes and way of life in MI I’m glad to see that we should be getting a fuller picture on the state of play soon.,2020-07-07 15:18:34,Twitter Web App,12,56
That includes a letter sent to PHMSA the federal agency that oversees pipeline safety and my amendment passed in the House last week that would force the agency to immediately tell the state if and when any pipeline damage occurs.,2020-07-07 15:18:34,Twitter Web App,11,62
At a minimum Michiganders deserve answers on reported damage to Line 5 –– and right quick.  While Enbridge has dragged its feet on sharing that information I've worked with @MIAttyGen Dana Nessel to push for some of those answers. https://t.co/kKn85fklPD,2020-07-07 15:18:33,Twitter Web App,34,141

The professionals at the agency that published the report should be there to characterize the intel their confidence in it and context for it.

Something has been off about that relationship since the beginning and Americans are quite literally paying in blood for his pandering to Putin.,2020-06-28 15:04:23,Twitter Web App,605,2850
Of all the ways this president has broken with tradition of past presidents his constant yielding to the Russians is up there as the most confounding and strategically damaging to U.S. interests.,2020-06-28 15:04:23,Twitter Web App,401,2004
The fact that staff drew up response options but somehow no one informed the Pres. seems to reflect an entrenched feeling that at best the Pres. needed plausible deniability &amp; at worst they assessed Trump would sacrifice US troops for his relationship with Putin &amp; the Taliban.,2020-06-28 15:04:22,Twitter Web App,327,1659
If they thought the President would have done the right thing and defended the lives and honor of our American troops in Afghanistan they would have told him immediately.,2020-06-28 15:04:22,Twitter Web App,261,1591
... both because of the implications with the Russians and with the Taliban who the President was negotiating with in real time.  Either the senior staff was truly incompetent or worse: they purposely withheld the info for fear it would disrupt the President’s relationships.,2020-06-28 15:04:22,Twitter Web App,269,1718
I’m at a loss on the news that the White House knew Russian operatives were paying bounties for Taliban attacks on U.S. &amp; NATO soldiers.

Michiganders deserve answers and fast –– including what caused the reported damage to the pipeline and how close we came to a leak in the Mackinac straits.  I support @GovWhitmer and @MIAttyGen's efforts to halt pipeline operations until we get those answers.,2020-06-23 23:10:54,Twitter Web App,11,55
Enbridge’s claim that the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration PHMSA the federal regulatory agency charged with overseeing pipeline safety had “no objections” to reopening the west leg of the pipeline just days after reported damage raises serious questions.,2020-06-23 23:10:54,Twitter Web App,8,28
A leak from Enbridge’s aging Line 5 oil pipeline poses an existential threat to our Great Lakes and it is unacceptable that Enbridge refuses to answer basic questions about the recent damage that occurred to the pipeline in the Mackinac straits.,2020-06-23 23:10:54,Twitter Web App,5,15

It is important to me to meaningfully recognize the significance of this day to Black Americans and everyone who cares about equality and justice. One way we can do that is to provide the day off to honor the holiday and to support efforts to make Juneteenth a national holiday.,2020-06-19 17:28:05,Twitter Web App,7,37
Juneteenth is the oldest celebration of the end of slavery in the U.S. The day is an important celebration of freedom and a reminder of the slow march toward equality.  Starting today every year our office will be closed on Juneteenth in observance of the holiday.,2020-06-19 17:28:05,Twitter Web App,19,156

These are basic questions. This info isn't classified. HASC has asked the U.S. military these same Qs regularly on wars in Iraq &amp; Afghanistan and military engagements around the world.  The least they owe us is a response when the lives of their fellow Americans are on the line.,2020-06-06 15:31:38,Twitter Web App,63,310
The military is trained to treat the “other” as an adversary. For domestic law enforcement these are the people you are sworn to protect.  It’s a totally different mindset and a toxic mix if these forces are looking at the crowd as enemies.,2020-06-06 15:31:37,Twitter Web App,79,296
Are these forces trained to manage civilian protests? Policing and crowd control are learned skills.  Few of the personnel out there today appear to have any training in domestic law enforcement or crowd control.,2020-06-06 15:31:37,Twitter Web App,52,248
On rules of engagement: are all these forces carrying weapons? What are rules for using them? How will they respond to provocation?  There's a real possibility for one shaky member to respond inappropriately &amp; events to spiral out of control. Public should understand those rules.,2020-06-06 15:31:36,Twitter Web App,51,255

I hope the Senate will quickly come to the table so we can find common ground negotiate and get small businesses the help they need.,2020-05-18 21:22:37,Twitter Web App,8,37
In the HEROES Act we extended the time businesses have to use PPP funds from 8 to 24 weeks and added flexibility so they can use the funds in the ways they need.  That’s good for entrepreneurs for workers and for downtowns across Michigan.,2020-05-18 21:22:37,Twitter Web App,7,43
A common concern I hear from #MI08 businesses: they’re eager and grateful for PPP loans but worried because the program forces them to spend the money very quickly — within 8 weeks — and that doesn’t work since most businesses haven't reopened.

.@GovWhitmer's announcement on resuming manufacturing is an important step in the deliberate careful resumption of our economy.  The next step is for every facility to carefully consider and plan for health and safety. https://t.co/10WHcqmczF,2020-05-07 21:29:21,Twitter Web App,16,63

Unfortunately not every community in our district has access to broadband internet.   As remote work and education become the new normal we need to see broadband as a public good that citizens deserve access to just as they do to electricity and water. https://t.co/wV62U0VoX4,2020-05-07 14:15:50,Twitter Web App,19,54
The resolution simply reiterated the roles laid out in the Constitution on the declaration of war.   And that is why it received bipartisan support — because it confirmed what is laid out in the U.S. Constitution.  No more but certainly no less.,2020-05-07 00:26:42,Twitter Web App,7,39
Contrary to the President’s statement he — and any president — always retains the right to self defense. This was stated clearly in the bill.,2020-05-07 00:26:42,Twitter Web App,5,32
The authority to declare war the most consequential decision our gov. can make rests with Congress. For too long Congress has abdicated that responsibility.  In this instance Congress on a bipartisan basis took its responsibility to discuss &amp; debate these issues seriously.,2020-05-07 00:26:42,Twitter Web App,2,18
The President's veto of this legislation is disappointing but not surprising.  What is more important and will have lasting impact is that Congress has taken a bipartisan step to reassert its constitutional role in matters of peace and war. https://t.co/8AKkyh07rH,2020-05-07 00:26:41,Twitter Web App,26,68
As the rep. of the MSU community that has been deeply affected by sexual assault I'm disappointed @BetsyDeVosED finalized Title IX roll-backs that make it harder for survivors to come forward –– and force changes on schools disrupted by a global pandemic. https://t.co/9dMhzjbni8,2020-05-06 22:18:22,Twitter Web App,23,96
Supporting small cities and towns shouldn't be a partisan issue –– it’s about beating back this virus and getting back on our feet.  @MayorBarnett President of @usmayors and I advocate for more support to communities fighting COVID-19 in @DetNewsOpinion: https://t.co/DxjvsQjkqk,2020-05-05 17:36:00,Twitter Web App,11,53

We should get back to work in a safe and responsible way as soon as we can.

The decision to transition back to work &amp; school should be based on science and facts. We should get back to work in a safe &amp; responsible way as soon as we can.  We should not go back if it risks a second deadly wave of COVID nor should we stay home any longer than necessary.,2020-04-30 22:38:03,Twitter Web App,28,302
Michiganders are doing just that every day so I was disappointed to see that many of those protesting today took the opposite approach putting their own interests ahead of the health and safety of their fellow citizens.,2020-04-30 22:38:03,Twitter Web App,16,244
Just as our parents and grandparents were called to serve &amp; endure we are now called to serve &amp; endure. As they rose to the challenges of their era so shall we.  And they did that by realizing that in a community we all have responsibilities to each other esp. during a crisis.,2020-04-30 22:38:03,Twitter Web App,27,233
They are trying to figure out when we can work again and where how to save our businesses and how to pay bills without a paycheck.  But the majority of Michiganders also realize that our country is going through a once-in-a-generation crisis.,2020-04-30 22:38:02,Twitter Web App,20,231
But we also have the right to speak out against that behavior and honor the vast majority of our fellow citizens who choose a different path.  The majority of Michiganders are suffering significant loss of income and profound changes to their everyday lives.,2020-04-30 22:38:02,Twitter Web App,30,346
The right to free speech is so fundamental that the protesters today were able to exercise their rights at the expense of the health of the police sergeant at arms officers staff and elected leaders who they yelled at at close range without face masks.,2020-04-30 22:38:02,Twitter Web App,28,179
Michiganders can even brandish semi-automatic weapons inside our State Capitol and hurl insults despite the inherent threat those actions can pose.,2020-04-30 22:38:02,Twitter Web App,14,150
Americans have the right to carry signs with hateful slogans and swastikas to wave confederate flags and to transform what could have been a protest about public health restrictions into a rally that promoted violence and hate as many did today.,2020-04-30 22:38:01,Twitter Web App,18,181
In response to the few hundred protestors who showed up in our Capitol and my district today:  Americans have the right to protest. Americans have the right to make unfounded claims about the virus and dispute the death toll of 3600 Michiganders as many speakers did today.,2020-04-30 22:38:01,Twitter Web App,128,619
I would not ordinarily advocate for legislation telling the executive branch how to manage a crisis but I cannot ignore the outcry from my district and my state.

On the heels of fighting to get PPE to frontline workers states like MI must now scramble to build testing capacity.  There's a role for the Admin. to play in accelerating the flow of these supplies –– and making sure they get to areas of greatest need. https://t.co/SkAd7G6GZ1,2020-04-30 14:02:21,Twitter Web App,11,69
While I don't agree with the president on many things I do agree we should support American manufacturing –– esp. when it comes to supplies we need to protect health and safety.   I hope the president will take strong action to ensure vital medical supplies are Made in America.,2020-04-29 20:15:27,Twitter Web App,3,32
I developed the Made in America Medical Supply Chain Initiative to address this gap in our homeland security.  It would adopt the same Made-in-America rules for critical medical supplies that we use for military equipment.,2020-04-29 20:15:27,Twitter Web App,5,35
We have suffered because so much of our medical supply chain is offshore. We are fighting a war against #COVID19 but our armor is made overseas.   We’d never outsource the production of jet fighters or combat boots and the same should go for gloves gowns masks and test swabs.,2020-04-29 20:15:27,Twitter Web App,0,7
Mr. President as you consider efforts to secure our supply chain don’t make this a choice between punishing China or placating China.  We should care less about what China thinks and more about what helps keep the American people safe. https://t.co/WKZZqIV5n0,2020-04-29 20:15:26,Twitter Web App,10,57
If we don't allow smaller cities &amp; towns to benefit from federal assistance many could be forced to take drastic action––including laying off the very same personnel working on the front lines of this crisis.

Today @GovWhitmer took action to adjust her executive orders — allowing some businesses to open if they can do it in a safe way while tightening requirements on wearing masks in public.,2020-04-24 23:12:08,Twitter Web App,8,62
Every Michigander is eager to get back to work — and the vast majority of us also recognize that the only thing worse for our economy that shutting down once would be having to do it twice.,2020-04-24 23:12:07,Twitter Web App,45,213

Mr. President we don’t need troops. We need tests. We don’t need the 82nd Airborne on our border—we need N95 masks in our hospitals.

From $17 to $276 in 20 years: The cost of insulin has gone up so much that it's pricing people like Sarah out of their lives.  With diabetics making up almost 10% of our population this is reaching the level of a crisis. https://t.co/69srXvhI7B,2020-02-10 22:00:42,Twitter Media Studio,72,199
Today our bipartisan bill to connect veterans with service dogs in their communities just passed the House with unanimous support.  I'm incredibly proud to co-lead the PAWS Act a bill to improve veterans' mental health and wellbeing through training and adopting service dogs. https://t.co/LK2HkwvvmN,2020-02-05 21:52:13,Twitter Web App,47,226
Sarah is an incredible advocate for the diabetic community. She's from Holly and I’m thrilled she will be joining me at the State of the Union tomorrow. https://t.co/3W7CybY6rF,2020-02-03 20:41:17,Twitter Web App,35,120
Tonight we’re rooting for Kansas City since @Big_Fish79 a @WeAreSCHS alum from Rochester Hills will be BRINGING IT on the front line.   Plus anyone who goes viral for doing a ‘Stone Cold’ Steve Austin impression — on the field no less — gets my enduring support.,2020-02-03 00:44:59,Twitter for iPhone,6,69
We need to sound the alarm bells on the cost of insulin. I sat down with Sarah who will be my guest to the State of the Union on Tuesday to talk about the 9% of Michiganders who have diabetes whose insulin costs are through the roof. Here’s what she had to say: https://t.co/M2Fp0ORO8N,2020-02-01 02:28:11,Twitter Web App,36,130
2) His comments on ending deportation of Iraqi Christians and minorities as myself and my colleagues have been pushing for many months. Iraqi minorities are valued members of our communities in Michigan &amp; deporting them to Iraq puts their lives at risk. https://t.co/n65s2v01uJ,2020-01-31 02:09:25,Twitter for iPhone,7,78
1) Michigan has the right facilities capabilities and workforce to house the F-35 which would bring good-paying jobs to our state. https://t.co/ZzH4eav12p,2020-01-31 02:09:24,Twitter for iPhone,3,55
I don’t see eye to eye with the President on everything but there were two things in his speech tonight in addition to my support for the new USMCA that I agreed with:,2020-01-31 02:09:24,Twitter for iPhone,7,87
We owe it to our military –– and to ourselves as a nation –– to provide our troops clarity and to abide by the Constitution they have sworn their lives to protect.,2020-01-30 16:45:45,Twitter Web App,8,43
Bottom line: today's votes contribute to the conversation that started earlier this month around my WPR.   Together they reiterate what's in the Constitution: no President can take the U.S. into war without engaging the American public and coming to Congress for authorization.,2020-01-30 16:45:45,Twitter Web App,12,40
2) @RepBarbaraLee’s amendment which would repeal the 2002 AUMF that authorized military force against Saddam Hussein's regime.,2020-01-30 16:45:45,Twitter Web App,7,21
1) @RepRoKhanna’s amendment which says that the President does not currently have the authorization to use protracted force against Iran and prohibits the use of federal funds for any such military action in or against Iran unless Congress specifically authorizes it.,2020-01-30 16:45:45,Twitter Web App,7,20
So what is Congress voting on today? Two pieces of legislation meant to clarify the authority the President does and does not have in using military force:,2020-01-30 16:45:44,Twitter Web App,5,18
In fact Secretary of Defense @EsperDoD publicly affirmed in a House Armed Services Committee hearing on December 11 2019 that the Administration does not currently have authorization to use force against the state of Iran.,2020-01-30 16:45:44,Twitter Web App,4,18
2. The 2002 AUMF authorized President Bush to use military force against the Saddam Hussein regime in Iraq. Given that Saddam fell in 2003 most believe this is an outdated unnecessary authorization.   The 2002 AUMF also does not authorize war against the state of Iran.,2020-01-30 16:45:44,Twitter Web App,4,16
I am a big believer that the 2001 AUMF should stay on the books until a suitable replacement can be debated and approved.  But the 2001 AUMF does not authorize war against the state of Iran.,2020-01-30 16:45:44,Twitter Web App,4,13
1. The 2001 AUMF which authorized President Bush to use military force against Al Qaeda and its affiliates for their role in the 9/11 attacks.  This 2001 AUMF is very much in use today as it allows for counter-terrorism operations against Al Qaeda affiliates such as ISIS.,2020-01-30 16:45:44,Twitter Web App,4,12
There are currently two Congressional authorizations for the use of military force (AUMF) on the books:,2020-01-30 16:45:43,Twitter Web App,4,10
President Trump provided that written notification after killing Qassem Soleimani.  My bipartisan War Powers Resolution simply reiterates the very point of the original WPR:  POTUS must seek Congressional authorization if he intends to use protracted military force against Iran.,2020-01-30 16:45:43,Twitter Web App,5,19
In 1973 Congress passed the War Powers Resolution (WPR) with bipartisan support. It says:  POTUS must notify Congress within 48 hrs of initiating the use of military force.  Military force must be terminated within 60 days unless POTUS receives Congressional authorization.,2020-01-30 16:45:43,Twitter Web App,6,16
I support this critical right to self defense against imminent threats. And I know from my experience at the Pentagon that there’s simply no way to wait for Congressional approval if an attack on the U.S. or our people is imminent.,2020-01-30 16:45:43,Twitter Web App,4,12
The Constitution makes clear that the President always retains the right to self defense against imminent threats even without coming to Congress for approval in advance.,2020-01-30 16:45:43,Twitter Web App,3,13
The President derives authority to use military force from two sources: (1) the Constitution and (2) Congressional authorization.,2020-01-30 16:45:42,Twitter Web App,8,21
As an Army wife &amp; stepmom to a daughter &amp; son-in-law in the Army I feel strongly that issues of war and peace should be publicly debated.  Congress has been derelict in its responsibility for ~20 yrs under both Dem. &amp; Republican leadership to seriously address these issues.,2020-01-30 16:45:42,Twitter Web App,14,52
Bottom line: these votes help start a necessary conversation on the gravest decisions we in Congress are asked to make -- whether or not to send our troops into war.   For many of us this is not a theoretical exercise.,2020-01-30 16:45:42,Twitter Web App,6,24
Today the House will vote on two amendments that address Congress’s role in authorizing the use of military force.   Given that my War Powers Resolution passed the House on January 9 I thought it important that we put all of these votes into context.,2020-01-30 16:45:42,Twitter Web App,25,102
I’m eager to work with Republicans to pass a bipartisan bill that rebuilds our systems to last and am glad to see @GovWhitmer push for action to get our roads fixed as soon as possible.,2020-01-30 02:48:12,Twitter Web App,4,80
No matter if you’re a Democrat Republican or Independent the urgent need to fix our roads and infrastructure is something we can all agree on.  This is a bipartisan issue in our communities and it should be the same way in Congress.,2020-01-30 02:48:12,Twitter Web App,37,430
But we’re just getting started. We will continue this fight until every Michigan resident can drink clean water from their tap and swim and fish in clean waters.,2020-01-29 15:32:55,Twitter Web App,6,36
PFAS is everywhere in our communities; nearly every living being has detectable levels of PFAS in their blood.   We must reverse this trend. Clean water must be treated as a right and we should view the threat to our waters for what it is –– a threat to our homeland security.,2020-01-29 15:32:54,Twitter Web App,10,35
If there was one thing I took from the @DarkWatersMovie a compelling new film with @MarkRuffalo about the fight to hold DuPont accountable for PFAS contamination it was the powerful results that are possible when a determined person speaks out. https://t.co/Zhs2JP885c,2020-01-29 15:32:54,Twitter Web App,22,62
The urgency of lowering prescription drug costs isn’t a theoretical exercise for Sarah or for the 800000 diabetics across our state – and the leaders convening on Tuesday night have the power to finish the job and sign into law legislation like #HR3 that drives down costs.,2020-01-28 22:35:09,Twitter Web App,16,67
Sarah Stark is an incredible advocate for the diabetic community who lives in my town of Holly. This is a receipt from 1999 when Sarah paid $17.75 for a vial of insulin. She now pays 15 times that: $276 per vial.  I'm thrilled that next week Sarah will be my guest at #SOTU. https://t.co/xXhtqjZ9R5,2020-01-28 22:35:09,Twitter Web App,36,146
I’m pleased that tonight we will be voting on the Never Again Education Act a bill I co-sponsor to support continued education on the Holocaust so that future generations will #NeverForget.,2020-01-27 17:44:36,Twitter Web App,6,48
We remember and honor the lives of the 6 million Jews who were murdered — and understand that it is our responsibility to confront the troubling rise in anti-Semitism we have seen here in Michigan and communities across the country in recent months.,2020-01-27 17:44:36,Twitter Web App,4,41
On #InternationalHolocaustRemembranceDay 75 years since the liberation of Auschwitz we resolve that each new generation learns about and never forgets the tragedy of the Holocaust.,2020-01-27 17:44:36,Twitter Web App,9,62
So glad to see @GovWhitmer will be giving the State of the Union response. The issues we’re talking about in Michigan are the ones we need to focus on to defend working families everywhere and I’m thrilled the country will get to see our state in the spotlight. https://t.co/nfXOyU0aEU,2020-01-24 20:04:10,Twitter Web App,28,167
In Howell yesterday I sat down with senior advocates and caregivers. With our state’s population rapidly aging and with costs of housing and healthcare rising we absolutely need to do more to protect our already vulnerable seniors from scams &amp; schemes. https://t.co/xCKXt06UBF,2020-01-24 18:36:19,Twitter Web App,13,53
As Michiganders continue to worry if their water is safe for their children to drink to play in to hunt and fish near — this rule takes us backwards before we had basic protections for our families against pollution.,2020-01-24 15:58:31,Twitter Web App,22,87
Clean water is a right &amp; not privilege — and in Michigan it's about our safety &amp; our way of life. The Administration's rollback is significant: it ends protections we've had since the 1970s to prevent companies from dumping pollutants into our waterways. https://t.co/UTwGhopMXO,2020-01-24 15:58:31,Twitter Web App,110,266
- To allow Medicare to negotiate for lower drug prices - To make vision dental and hearing coverage part of Medicare - To lower out-of-pocket drug costs for Medicare Part D patients  Those are the solutions I want to work w/ the President to pass for the benefit of our seniors.,2020-01-23 19:58:43,Twitter Web App,19,71
Just today I'm holding a roundtable in Howell to talk about healthcare issues impacting seniors — and some of the legislation we in the House have passed in recent months:,2020-01-23 19:57:36,Twitter Web App,11,60
Our seniors have paid into the system their entire lives and they should be able to rely on this important earned benefit.  While we need to remain clear-eyed about the financial challenges facing our country we cannot pay down our debt on the backs of seniors.,2020-01-23 19:57:36,Twitter Web App,7,31
At a time when seniors are facing rising healthcare and prescription drug costs we shouldn't be talking about cutting Medicare — we should be talking about how to lower costs. https://t.co/XONn27mrUa,2020-01-23 19:57:36,Twitter Web App,108,335
