So on this #SmallBusinessSaturday –– and really any chance you can –– support local small businesses in your community. They’ve busted their butts and been so creative during this uncertain time. Shop early and local to support our #MI08 small businesses!,2020-11-28 17:35:48,Twitter Web App,4,32
One of the most inspiring parts of the campaign trail was getting to visit the amazing small businesses of the district. Local businesses are vital to our community and the pandemic has been tough for many to navigate. https://t.co/KaSaN8u7VO,2020-11-28 17:35:47,Twitter Web App,9,125

This past week we lost our Dixie after 13 years. This is on the heels of losing our other old girl Dakota back in August.

I'll join @NPRWeekend later this morning to discuss how attacks on our elections are corroding democracy. https://t.co/OaTtDrSPoK,2020-11-21 12:31:42,TweetDeck,11,99
Proud to join my Republican colleague from Michigan @RepPaulMitchell in the @DetroitNews to state clearly:   In our system the will of the people prevails. The continued refusal to acknowledge the election results risks corroding our democracy.  https://t.co/r3QLGNxL6H,2020-11-20 12:46:00,TweetDeck,185,777
It is time for this to end. Joe Biden won Michigan and won it by 14 times Trump’s winning margin in 2016. No recount will overturn 14600 votes. We need officials on both sides of the aisle to stop participating in attacks on democracy and to start defending it.,2020-11-18 03:02:08,TweetDeck,196,1204
Next step: Nov. 23 when the state Board of Canvassers meet to certify state results.

It’s been a rollercoaster of a night. To recap: two partisan officials on the Wayne County Board of Canvassers tried to deny hundreds of thousands of votes out of Detroit – then reversed course due to the public outcry.,2020-11-18 03:00:09,TweetDeck,257,1871

It’s hard to miss that Donald Trump talks down to all kinds of people – as a woman and Democrat in Congress it’s a fixture of my life and all our lives. He directs vile hateful language to women people of color and immigrants among others to intentionally divide us.,2020-11-13 19:42:00,TweetDeck,11,113
Some important context to today’s @politico story: While I did say Trump “doesn’t talk down” to some voters as the story points out I was referring to a specific subset of voters: those who only come out for Trump and surged to the polls in 2020.,2020-11-13 19:41:12,TweetDeck,13,100

Few know Michigan politics better than @michpoligal - formerly of @freep and now writing for @nytimes - who lays out the challenges of this race without MSU students on campus.

With 3 weeks until Election Day Team Slotkin has been hard at work! Volunteers have been going door to door dropping off literature (we call it “contactless canvassing”) addressing postcards (we’ve sent 23000!) delivering yard signs and staffing booths at community events. https://t.co/R3CqCqgz5M,2020-10-13 18:48:53,Twitter Web App,39,89

Growing up I learned Michigan values: decency integrity and putting others before yourself. It was as a young CIA officer that I put those values in action: putting the mission first telling hard truths and serving the country before yourself. https://t.co/Uccbfok1Yc,2020-10-13 15:08:25,Twitter Media Studio,36,119

No better way to spend a perfect Michigan fall Sunday than visiting local businesses delivering yard signs and kicking off a contactless canvassing shift in downtown Howell.

These are the wrenching questions families across our district face if President Trump succeeds in destroying the Affordable Care Act. I know I will be fighting for Keith’s family and all the families I met with today across our district.,2020-10-10 23:34:26,Twitter Web App,4,40
What happens if the law goes away? Will the insurance company raise gouge Keith because of his son’s pre-existing condition? Will he be able to stay on his dad’s insurance at all? If the ACA is repealed Keith wonders: What happens to my son’s health care the next day?,2020-10-10 23:34:26,Twitter Web App,4,31
Kyle has muscular dystrophy. It’s a tough disease -- and expensive to treat. Because the law allows young people to stay on their parents’ plans Kyle has been able to stay on his dad’s health insurance even as he headed off to college.,2020-10-10 23:34:25,Twitter Web App,1,35
My last stop was an old friend: Keith in Howell. When the law allowing young adults to stay on their parents’ insurance to age 26 passed more than 2 million uninsured young people got coverage. Keith’s son is one. https://t.co/vNhLlyGPx7,2020-10-10 23:34:25,Twitter Web App,21,148
She told me what it was like to see young people who got coverage through their parents' insurance and self-employed workers who used their new coverage to establish a relationship with a health care provider for the first time.,2020-10-10 22:02:28,Twitter Web App,12,47
Julie Thomas-Beckett is a nurse practitioner in the Lansing area who remembers what it was like before protections for pre-existing conditions and other provisions of the ACA became law. https://t.co/vK7dOKIxqa,2020-10-10 22:00:56,Twitter Web App,18,79
But those rules are threatened by the lawsuit now in front of the Supreme Court. If that lawsuit succeeds costs for these simple preventive health measures are likely to go up and the health of Robert’s patients to go down.,2020-10-10 19:30:37,Twitter Web App,7,22
Those rules make it more likely his patients get things like annual checkups screenings for things like breast cancer even flu shots. It’s just one example of rules in place that lower costs and help us all stay healthy.,2020-10-10 19:30:07,Twitter Web App,5,20
Robert Mavrogordato is a medical-surgical nurse in Lansing. At his practice patients get treated regardless of insurance status -- but he sees first-hand the importance of current protection that make preventive care free of out-of-pocket costs. https://t.co/VNoKQAT5gm,2020-10-10 19:29:41,Twitter Web App,5,12
I know how hard cancer is on families -- and how much harder it will be for families like Mark’s if they lose protections for pre-existing conditions. Yet doing away with those protections is just what the Trump administration is arguing for in court.,2020-10-10 18:48:18,Twitter Web App,5,19
When Mark changed jobs a few years later because of the protections currently in law he was able to get coverage for the family on the health care exchange. And Susan’s pre-existing condition wasn’t a roadblock to getting covered.,2020-10-10 18:47:51,Twitter Web App,4,15
Mark Collatz of East Lansing is a good example of how events from years ago will take on new significance if the Supreme Court tosses out protections for pre-existing conditions. Mark’s wife Susan Loomis survived brain cancer several years ago. https://t.co/30GWMrWFMr,2020-10-10 18:47:16,Twitter Web App,9,22
Every community in our district has neighbors like Kara and Elizabeth. The ACA’s protections are a safety net for their families but if the Trump administration’s lawsuit succeeds that safety net would disappear.,2020-10-10 15:50:39,Twitter Web App,7,29
Elizabeth’s coverage comes from her husband’s employer. Without the ACA she knows that her husband’s insurance company could charge more for her care and that if they ever lost his insurance they’d struggle to find affordable coverage.,2020-10-10 15:50:12,Twitter Web App,7,24
Under the ACA Kara can keep her kids on her coverage until age 26 -- a protection that goes away if the Supreme Court invalidates the ACA. She’s not sure how she’ll get coverage for their serious conditions without the ACA.,2020-10-10 15:48:19,Twitter Web App,8,17
Next I stopped to talk to neighbors Kara Sprague and Elizabeth Kowal. Both Kara’s children have pre-existing conditions that would leave them exposed without ACA protections. Elizabeth herself has a pre-existing condition: diabetes. https://t.co/YdTdQQCvo5,2020-10-10 15:47:55,Twitter Web App,7,24
First stop: Linda and Craig Brown of Clarkston. Their two sons have serious chronic health conditions and even with Craig's coverage they pay $40000 a year for insurance. Her husband is holding off on retiring to keep that insurance. https://t.co/YKPxv9s6ch,2020-10-10 14:59:42,Twitter Web App,14,48
We’re on the road for our tour across the 8th District listening to constituents talk about what the Affordable Care Act means to them -- and what it would mean to lose the ACA. https://t.co/CS8dJeO4fm,2020-10-10 14:02:37,Twitter Web App,75,403
I see Mom in all the people who come to me with their own stories. Tomorrow I’ll cross the district to talk to them about what’s at stake. I hope you’ll follow along. In the meantime read about the case and what it means. https://t.co/I7IGr9RGkY,2020-10-10 00:39:06,Twitter Web App,19,46
This issue is personal for me. When my mom was diagnosed with the cancer that eventually took her life her coverage had lapsed. Insurance companies could charge her more because of a pre-existing condition.,2020-10-10 00:39:06,Twitter Web App,22,49
Tomorrow we’ll be one month away from that hearing. And I’ll spend the day visiting people across the 8th District who are waiting and watching to find out if the coverage they depend on will be there when they need it.,2020-10-10 00:39:06,Twitter Web App,8,17
Election Day is just 25 days away. But I’m looking at another date on the calendar: Nov. 10 one week after the election when the U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments about a lawsuit that could dismantle the Affordable Care Act and threaten health coverage for millions.,2020-10-10 00:39:05,Twitter Web App,49,171
We had a chance to chat about how business has been during COVID as well as try their amazing bagels. And keeping in the tradition Mike was sporting a Spartan shirt!,2020-10-09 22:43:54,Twitter Web App,6,46
It turned out that Rasul worked alongside our military and was now with our Embassy but his family owned The New Daily Bagel in Lansing! Today it all came full circle and I got the chance to meet Rasul’s brother Mike who owns the shop and is working there with his two sons.,2020-10-09 22:43:54,Twitter Web App,4,47
My visit to The New Daily Bagel today was an extra special one. Last year on a bipartisan trip with the House Armed Services Committee to Baghdad the first person I saw coming off the plane was a gentleman in a MSU hat. https://t.co/LURiOgQ4Gh,2020-10-09 22:43:53,Twitter Web App,17,124

I believe in bipartisanship in my bones because in a divided government that’s how to get things done. #MI08debate https://t.co/ptZNnOdYol,2020-10-07 01:55:58,Twitter Media Studio,26,93
Tonight I defended access to affordable health care while my opponent punted questions about how he would protect people with pre-existing conditions. #MI08debate https://t.co/2qZaTTYkcU,2020-10-07 01:32:10,Twitter Media Studio,39,207
Elissa cosponsored a bill to crack down on foreign interference in our elections. Michigan’s 8th needs a representative who takes these threats seriously. #MI08debate #MI08  https://t.co/QYFAZ3wuVR,2020-10-07 00:01:11,Twitter Web App,13,36
Here’s the first line of Elissa’s April press release: “I believe strongly in the right of all Americans to protest their government and that includes today’s protesters in Lansing –– even if I don’t agree with their premise." #MI08debate,2020-10-06 23:49:28,Twitter Web App,9,48
When given the opportunity to condemn hate and the Proud Boys Paul Junge attacked Elissa instead. #MI08debate #MI08 https://t.co/qHDCUkUy55,2020-10-06 23:48:11,Twitter Web App,45,113
Elissa believes in bipartisanship because she knows that’s how to get things done in Washington. That’s why Elissa wrote 22 bills with Republican cosponsors and passed nine provisions into law—all with bipartisan support. #MI08debate #MI08,2020-10-06 23:39:39,Twitter Web App,9,41
Elissa stands up to her party leadership when it’s in the best interest of the residents of Michigan’s 8th. Would Paul Junge do the same? #MI08debate https://t.co/lVz3HI5miN,2020-10-06 23:38:00,Twitter Web App,12,76
Paul Junge does not believe health care is a right. Elissa Slotkin believes all people deserve access to health care they can afford. She believes it’s a right. #MI08debate,2020-10-06 23:32:36,Twitter Web App,38,137
After 10 months of campaigning and three debates Paul Junge still can’t offer a clear plan to protect 310000 #MI08 residents with pre-existing conditions. #MI08debate,2020-10-06 23:27:02,Twitter Web App,24,104
Republicans claim they will protect people with pre-existing conditions. But their bills fall short of the ACA’s protections. Paul Junge shouldn’t use health care as a talking point. He should condemn Trump’s lawsuit to gut ACA protections. #MI08debate  https://t.co/LkmMxIFXp8,2020-10-06 23:26:08,Twitter Web App,14,49
One week after the election the Trump Administration will argue before the Supreme Court to overturn the ACA and its protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Paul Junge still won’t condemn that lawsuit. #MI08debate https://t.co/JdvW4jYSXj,2020-10-06 23:22:29,Twitter Media Studio,16,35
Paul Junge continues to resort to misleading claims about Elissa’s voting record. The Detroit Free Press fact-checked Junge confirming that Elissa has a staunch record of bipartisanship and rating Junge’s claims “mostly false." #MI08debate https://t.co/9RFYkchYFs,2020-10-06 23:20:56,Twitter Web App,11,34
Michigan was hard hit by COVID. Voting against relief puts politics above people and she will not stand for that. #MI08debate https://t.co/XUljFjAIMf,2020-10-06 23:19:33,Twitter Web App,9,38
Elissa worked with the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus to break through months of stalled COVID-19 talks and get both parties’ leadership back to the negotiating table because she puts residents of Michigan’s 8th before party politics. #MI08debate https://t.co/gjrE5uh3Ld,2020-10-06 23:15:11,Twitter Web App,8,31

My mom’s story is far too common and there’s still much work to be done to make sure that health care and prescription drugs are affordable and accessible.,2020-09-28 14:29:18,Twitter Web App,9,95
She had breast cancer in her early 30s so for the rest of her life she had a ‘pre-existing condition’ and insurance companies could gouge her. But when she was diagnosed with stage IV ovarian cancer in 2009 she had let her health insurance lapse and paid other bills.,2020-09-28 14:29:18,Twitter Web App,12,90
My mom is never far from my mind especially during #OvarianCancerAwarenessMonth. I see her in the people who come up to me on the street or at the grocery store telling me how much they’re struggling to pay their medical bills. https://t.co/85duESKxco,2020-09-28 14:29:18,Twitter Web App,42,211

It couldn’t be more important for a member of Congress to be clear about what they’re going to fight for. And Mr. Junge has been running for a year and I still don’t know what his health care policy is. #MI08debate https://t.co/9tai8LRWYo,2020-09-27 16:13:17,Twitter Media Studio,139,625
I have a strong bipartisan record and all Paul Junge does is attack me with misleading partisan talking points. That’s because he has no affirmative agenda. Michigan’s 8th deserves a candidate who is clear about what she is fighting for. #MI08debate https://t.co/UwGMcDDiVe,2020-09-27 15:52:51,Twitter Media Studio,163,696
Paul Junge tries to mislead voters on my record of bipartisanship but he worked for three chambers of commerce and the Detroit and Lansing Chambers of Commerce endorsed me instead—citing my bipartisanship. #MI08debate https://t.co/S7RV1jazuG,2020-09-27 15:25:37,Twitter Media Studio,63,282
Mr. Junge: If you are going to talk about my mother you should know what you're talking about. She deserves that and so do the 310000 people in our district who have a pre-existing condition like she did. #MI08debate https://t.co/3Opf0EJxRB,2020-09-27 15:10:14,Twitter Media Studio,4169,16417
Elissa knows trade deals need to benefit Michigan’s workers and prevent unsustainable outsourcing of our critical medical supply chains. #MI08debate https://t.co/Cf4u0awgPh,2020-09-27 14:26:22,Twitter Media Studio,42,123
Elissa ran for office because people like her mom who have a pre-existing condition deserve access to affordable health care. #MI08debate https://t.co/6UP1PnZWyZ,2020-09-27 14:22:45,Twitter Media Studio,53,197
Seven days after the election the Trump Administration will argue before the Supreme Court to destroy protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Paul Junge won’t stand with the people of Michigan’s 8th and condemn that lawsuit. #MI08debate https://t.co/qlyyTtCI1P,2020-09-27 14:19:35,Twitter Media Studio,54,128

The bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus COVID-19 relief plan that Elissa helped introduce pushed House leadership back to the negotiating table. That’s what bipartisan leadership is all about. #MI08debate https://t.co/Xy8hsf0B4d,2020-09-27 14:07:50,Twitter Web App,11,53

I don’t know how other members of Congress feel but when I see a cherry-picked attack ad I tend to want to dig in and nerd out.

For the third time independent fact checkers have caught my opponent trying to mislead voters with false claims. I worked for presidents of both parties to protect our nation and I know bipartisanship is the best way to get things done. https://t.co/6U3UpJ1XHb https://t.co/YsObSLjcvA,2020-09-23 14:03:29,Twitter Web App,31,120

On cutting the deficit it’s important to get specific. I’ve got concrete ideas for how we can cut spending and make medicines more affordable. My opponent “didn’t come ... with a list of specifics.” #MI08Debate #MI08 https://t.co/V5oXuTiRo4,2020-09-22 13:13:04,Twitter Media Studio,18,69

Elissa knows that in Michigan environmental security is homeland security. That’s why she has written 6 provisions that were signed into law to protect our lakes and rivers from the harmful pollutant PFAS. #MI08 #MI08debate https://t.co/azKEjU8BIG,2020-09-21 23:53:12,Twitter Web App,26,65
Elissa's Real Time Benefits Act passed with the votes of 184 Republicans: https://t.co/x2qTkKIko4 #MI08 #MI08debate,2020-09-21 23:49:22,Twitter Web App,8,27
Lowing the cost of prescription drugs is one of Elissa’s top priorities. She wrote and passed legislation in the House to make drug pricing more transparent. And she doesn’t accept money from pharmaceutical firms or any other corporate PAC. #MI08 #MI08debate https://t.co/Nlxz4s1XvR,2020-09-21 23:44:49,Twitter Web App,25,56
Paul Junge says he's always spoken out against hate groups but when he was given a chance to stand against the Proud Boys he attacked Elissa instead: https://t.co/qHDCUkUy55,2020-09-21 23:31:47,Twitter Web App,81,164
A member of the Problem Solvers Caucus Elissa worked with Democrats and Republicans to write a bipartisan compromise COVID aid package and she called on her leadership to put getting people the relief they need over partisan politics. #MI08 #MI08debate,2020-09-21 23:26:34,Twitter Web App,13,67
Elissa stands up to her party leadership when it’s in the best interest of the residents of Michigan’s 8th. Would Paul Junge do the same? #MIO8debate #MI08 https://t.co/nP40PxMEbj,2020-09-21 23:12:30,Twitter Web App,14,50

@draiochta14 Thank you Terry! Sorry if I was seriously fangirling over you and your husband's work on that call -- but my husband Dave and I are HUGE fans of Outlander and Battlestar Galactica.

After joining our High School Volunteer Kickoff I was so inspired to hear from many young adults who are going to be voting in their first election this fall.

Our August 4th primary is coming up and our sprint to the general starts soon.

He lived his values in his business and in everyday life. It’s something I still see in him today in his loyalty and concern for family and friends.

Today is Juneteenth the 155th anniversary of the end of slavery in the United States. More than two years after the Emancipation Proclamation enslaved Americans in the farthest reaches of the former Confederacy learned of their freedom.,2020-06-19 15:22:37,Twitter Web App,13,88

Today is a good day. Today I got to call one of our district campaign staffers Viviana and celebrate the Supreme Court decision on DACA with her.

This is especially important to reflect on in the wake of anti-racism protests around the country. This is a moment to recognize the discrimination and violence black members of the LGBTQ community face in particular.,2020-06-14 23:41:59,Twitter Web App,3,43
This year especially we must recognize that the progress the LGBTQ community has made did not come easily -- and that protesting was an effective tactic that advanced the cause for equality.,2020-06-14 23:41:59,Twitter Web App,4,47
It still hits me in the gut when I think about it. I know my mom would be thrilled with the progress our country has made. But that she’d also be telling me to “get on it” and continue pushing. The work is still far from over.,2020-06-14 23:41:59,Twitter Web App,3,30
My mom did not live to see the day when gay marriage became legal in Michigan.

#PrideMonth always makes me think about my mom. She came out in the 1980’s in metro Detroit long before it was a commonplace thing to do and lived the rest of her life as a gay woman. https://t.co/n4TrHyZNuO,2020-06-14 23:41:58,Twitter Web App,62,357

On this Memorial Day while we can’t be together we can still remember those who have given everything for this country. Listening to “Taps” connects us to them and to each other when we need it most.,2020-05-25 18:19:51,Twitter Web App,11,30
It is the most emotional part of every service. Even now when I participate in veterans events across the district the playing of “Taps” is the hardest part to get through. And that goes doubly for Dave.,2020-05-25 18:19:51,Twitter Web App,4,31
We’ve mourned infantrymen from the 101st which David served in and so many others who took their own lives. And because “Taps” is played at every one of their memorials the tune always brings back the cumulative loss we feel from all those that have died.,2020-05-25 18:19:51,Twitter Web App,3,12
We've attended dozens of funerals and memorial services to mourn friends and colleagues like Stu killed by a rocket in the Green Zone; Pat Joe Phil and Blaine who were killed while preparing for deployment; Devon and Andy who were killed on a peacekeeping mission in Kosovo.,2020-05-25 18:19:50,Twitter Web App,4,12
I find that it's impossible to hear “Taps” without thinking of loss. When I joined the CIA and went to Iraq I started hearing “Taps” more often. When I met and married Dave who had spent 30 years in the Army and served in Kosovo the first Gulf War and in Iraq I heard it more.,2020-05-25 18:19:50,Twitter Web App,3,10
This haunting tune started during the Civil War as a bugle call to signal end of day replacing three taps of the drum that had signaled lights out. Soon after it was played at its first military funeral because it was safer than the traditional firing of three rifle volleys.,2020-05-25 18:19:50,Twitter Web App,3,8
Whether we would have gone to a parade a cemetery or a private ceremony there is one thing that would surely be playing at every event this weekend: the playing of “Taps.”,2020-05-25 18:19:50,Twitter Web App,3,11
Today because of COVID-19 many of us who would otherwise be at Memorial Day events and services are home doing our best to halt the virus.,2020-05-25 18:19:50,Twitter Web App,17,99

Today I’m thinking of my mother-in-law and step-mom and of course of my own mom who gave so much to my brother and I and helped us become the people we are today. https://t.co/1lwj6h5Euf,2020-05-10 16:26:06,Twitter Web App,9,212
3) an envelope the postman dropped off that allows me to buy stamps by leaving money in my mailbox; 4) a USPS package from West Michigan with a heartfelt letter and materials about why we need re-start Michigan’s potash industry because China currently dominates the supply lines.,2020-05-08 16:04:38,Twitter Web App,1,15
I took this pic of my mail so I can remember what life is like under COVID. Today I received: 1) a religious pamphlet about COVID-19; 2) two ads enticing me to buy yard signs for my campaign; https://t.co/Erx7D0fNQt,2020-05-08 16:04:37,Twitter Web App,3,26
In these difficult times I’m inspired by acts of kindness like this one.,2020-05-07 18:08:19,Twitter Web App,3,17
Saw this sign as I was taking a walk the other morning and it made me smile. Thank you to the many front-line workers who continue to serve our community with such bravery and thank you to the folks who have gone out of their way to make signs like these. https://t.co/iL9bxPIlRQ,2020-05-07 18:08:18,Twitter Web App,10,73
Happy Seger-de-Mayo aka Bob Seger’s birthday! The hometown hero is 75 today.

Yesterday Michigan had its first test of holding an election during COVID-19 — and the results are informative. More than 200 communities held local elections and turnout was a record 24 percent more than double participation in the average May election.,2020-05-06 20:24:05,TweetDeck,30,142
Today we celebrate National Nurses Week and there has never been a more fitting time to thank our nurses for their service bravery and commitment.

When it comes to helping Michigan communities weather #COVID19 we can’t bog down in partisan debates. Our local governments need help to keep fighting this virus and that’s not a Red vs. Blue issue. https://t.co/Ed8Mi4qqAG,2020-05-05 18:33:35,Twitter Web App,11,51
The pandemic we’re experiencing now reminds us of the urgency of this issue. And even now amid this pandemic the Trump administration and its allies are fighting in court to end the Affordable Care Act and its protections for pre-existing conditions.,2020-05-04 22:34:29,Twitter Web App,17,199
While the ACA provides critical protections for people with pre-existing conditions it's far from perfect. There's much to be done to ensure that all Americans have access to affordable health care &amp; prescription drugs.,2020-05-04 22:34:28,Twitter Web App,8,132

She had thankfully beaten cancer as a young mom so for the rest of her life she had a pre-existing condition -- which meant getting health care coverage was always a struggle.,2020-05-04 22:34:28,Twitter Web App,8,116
I turned to my husband Dave and said: “No. You don’t get to ignore your constituents vote against their interests and keep your job.” Health care is personal to me. In 2011 my mom died of ovarian cancer.,2020-05-04 22:34:28,Twitter Web App,19,150
That was it. I had been thinking about running before that day but didn’t think I was going to do it. But seeing that celebration -- after months of my Congressman avoiding any type of public event on health care -- just broke me.,2020-05-04 22:34:27,Twitter Web App,13,171
In that moment I caught sight of my then-Congressman smiling and beaming and proud that he had just voted to repeal among other things protections for people with pre-existing conditions.,2020-05-04 22:34:27,Twitter Web App,21,154
Three years ago today I was sitting in my living room in Holly Michigan watching live CNN coverage of a Rose Garden ceremony celebrating the repeal of the Affordable Care Act (ACA).

But in the era of social distancing this effort will be even more important. There is no better way to make person-to-person contact without face-to-face communication. Personally I think it’s impossible not to read a hand written postcard -- especially if it’s written by a kid,2020-05-03 18:01:19,Twitter Web App,2,20
Want to help out the campaign from your own kitchen table? As part of adapting our campaign to meet the reality of COVID-19 we are officially launching the 2020 postcard program!

In our first two sessions we trained about 130 volunteers on how to check in on seniors in our district and if needed send them to the right people who can help them get any services they need. We also highlighted other ways they can volunteer in the fight against #COVID19.,2020-04-03 21:56:44,TweetDeck,4,22

This week we held the first two training sessions for our dedicated volunteers on how to support 8th District residents amid the #COVID19 crisis.
