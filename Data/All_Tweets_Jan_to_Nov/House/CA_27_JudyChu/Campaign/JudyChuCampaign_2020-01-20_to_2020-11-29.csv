Today is a new day for our country. I feel such relief and jubilation. It’s been 4 exhausting years but now it’s finally over. Together we will move forward under the leadership of @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris who will work to heal our divisions and unite us once again.,2020-11-07 18:29:48,Twitter for iPhone,2,13

Biden points out that 525 children  can’t find their parents due to Trump’s family separation policy. Trump’s response? “Good!” The character of our country is on the ballot right now. #BidenHarris2020 #Debates2020,2020-10-23 02:17:03,Twitter for iPhone,0,4

Thank you @BarackObama for your powerful warning about what is at stake right now. You’ve felt the weight of responsibility of the Oval Office &amp; know what terrible harm can be done if its occupant doesn’t care about the American people.

I fell in love with @DrBiden tonight perhaps because like me she was a dedicated community college teacher. But mainly she was the glue that helped the Bidens heal after incredible personal loss.

This is historic. Today @JoeBiden announces @KamalaHarris as his VP the first Asian American and first Black woman to be nominated for a major party ticket. Kamala is a proven leader and fighter for the little guy. We need #BidenHarris in the White House. let's get to work!,2020-08-11 21:18:36,Twitter Web App,12,31
@JoeBiden understands that racial inequities are a systemic problem. That's why he's introduced a plan to create an economy where Black Latino AAPI and Native American workers and families are finally welcomed as full participants. #BuildBackBetter https://t.co/IUhK409o3h,2020-07-29 01:50:55,Twitter Web App,0,3

I’m supporting @JoeBiden because we need a uniter in the White House. Not a man that uses tragedy and injustice as an opportunity to stoke the flames of racism and incite violence against Americans who are grieving. #AAPISforBiden,2020-05-30 00:38:59,Twitter for iPhone,4,14
We know that people of color are dying at higher rates from #COVID19. But with this joke of a report the Trump administration is either not willing or not capable of giving us the tools we need to support those that are hurting the most. https://t.co/BGrMVJsMYH,2020-05-28 22:51:13,Twitter Web App,1,3
Trump failed to act in time and now nearly 100000 people are dead from #COVID19. But instead of taking responsibility he's doing what he always does: stoking xenophobia. @JoeBiden &amp; @TammyforIL are right. His words cause real harm and he doesn't care.   https://t.co/MQuhWPZcYf,2020-05-27 16:53:16,Twitter Web App,1,3
