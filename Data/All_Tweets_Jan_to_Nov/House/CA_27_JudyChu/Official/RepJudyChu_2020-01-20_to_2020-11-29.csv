Either Rep. Scalise has not read my bill or he has and is being dishonest to you about it. Repealing the Muslim Bans would in no way impact our #Covid-19 response.

My thoughts are with my friend and colleague @RepJerryNadler right now. He has done a remarkable job in this impeachment trial but now is the time to be with family and we are all hoping for a full and speedy recovery for his wife. https://t.co/Ace4LqGMiu,2020-01-31 18:16:50,TweetDeck,8,62
For anyone needing to understand how Trump's immigration policy is not about safety but about arbitrary cruelty you must read this incredible investigation by @DLind about a family torn apart at the border. We cannot keep our eyes closed to these horrors. https://t.co/YRjQZZorYu,2020-01-31 16:19:51,TweetDeck,19,25
Let me make it clearer: Members of Congress cannot use public funds to promote our election or even mention an opponent. That's good &amp; right. But the Senate is giving Trump permission to use foreign aid to demand election interference. And choosing not to punish. https://t.co/hxTr9V0ENY,2020-01-31 15:24:53,TweetDeck,20,52
Confirming the House made our case that the President is guilty of interfering in an election and "undermining the principle of equal justice" but choosing not to convict is granting permission to this and future presidents to interfere in elections as much as they want https://t.co/uCBtIzI3Cl,2020-01-31 15:05:07,TweetDeck,23,81
There's no better metaphor for Trump being all show and no substance than his pointless border wall being knocked down by a strong wind. He's wasting taxpayer money to stir up xenophobia and look tough. Watch the video to see where it's gotten us. https://t.co/gvUY2DDh20,2020-01-30 22:41:39,TweetDeck,19,57
Iran is a threat to American interests but as the Iran Nuclear Deal showed us conflict is not inevitable. We do not need a war with Iran. That is why today I voted to reclaim Congress's power repeal the 2002 #AUMF and prohibit any funding for an unauthorized war. https://t.co/rwMcpUePkg,2020-01-30 21:22:02,TweetDeck,7,56
This disconnected patchwork of enclaves divided and surrounded by Israeli settlements is not a viable Palestinian state. Today I joined my colleagues in a letter to President Trump rejecting this sham plan and opposing unilateral annexations &amp; urging a true two-state solution. https://t.co/CuYtAgmR6p,2020-01-30 16:50:06,TweetDeck,8,37
With news of #coronavirus cases in LA County I want to share some ways to keep you and your family safe:  - Wash your hands thoroughly  - Avoid close contact with people who are sick - Avoid travel to China - Stay up to date w/ information from @CDCgov &amp; @lapublichealth https://t.co/uezB2sPqUv,2020-01-29 23:43:19,TweetDeck,11,12
Over 5 years of reporting in Syria @waadalkateab documented the destruction of Aleppo and the intentional targeting of hospitals like the one she ran with her husband. Now her incredible documentary @forsamafilm has been nominated for an Oscar. It was an honor to meet  her. https://t.co/h52N8OPdQw,2020-01-29 20:55:25,Twitter for iPhone,10,37
This is an incredibly troubling argument that a President can do anything they want in order to keep themselves in power. It's a recipe for tyranny. President Trump had corrupt intention in asking Ukraine to interfere in our election. https://t.co/oKjxjab9mn,2020-01-29 20:20:11,TweetDeck,39,123
The trade deal the President signed is not the trade deal he originally got. That's because Democrats spent months working w/ the administration to make the new NAFTA a deal that actually helps workers and protects the environment. I'm proud of our work even if Trump ignores it. https://t.co/kVYnc0DO9C,2020-01-29 17:04:55,TweetDeck,20,67

America's debt is on track to hit $1 trillion - 98% of our economy - by 2030. This is the direct outcome of the #GOPTaxScam. Despite what they claimed tax cuts for the rich don't pay for themselves they're paid for by you and your children. https://t.co/zLoIsEkk4S,2020-01-29 14:46:46,TweetDeck,22,31
Who wore it best?  So great to have @ChrisEvans back on the Hill today to talk about how we can help more Americans understand and engage in politics not by fighting but by hearing each other out. https://t.co/2oedHrBCML,2020-01-28 22:57:43,TweetDeck,107,832
Paid Family and Medical Leave is as essential for strong families as it is for a strong economy. Nobody understands that better than @JoanLunden who shared her experiences today with @WaysMeansCmte https://t.co/cQuMEPDhHS,2020-01-28 16:02:08,Twitter for iPhone,12,36
As part of #HolocaustMemorialDay commemorations I joined an event to read the names of the 6 million Jews who were killed. Reading their names ensures they are not forgotten. Standing up to anti-semitism and bigotry is our responsibility. #NeverAgain is our promise. https://t.co/AYa6EcBUKm,2020-01-27 18:17:40,TweetDeck,6,25
There's a time tested way of proving this: You and your associates testify under oath to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Hiding and blocking witnesses is a cover up. https://t.co/5N3ACCwbOL,2020-01-27 17:15:03,TweetDeck,13,74
White nationalists like Stephen Miller think America belongs only to white people. Clearly they are wrong. And so is the cruel Muslim Ban. On the 3rd anniversary of this hateful policy I'm proud to stand with Sen. @ChrisCoons to announce a markup of our #NoBanAct! https://t.co/zpRWHTmpdd,2020-01-27 16:40:42,TweetDeck,26,85
Donald Trump would rather nobody have healthcare than allow women to have complete healthcare. Abortion care is safe legal healthcare. And Trump should not hold all Californians hostages in his war on women. We will fight this. https://t.co/QH1ITtPXkg,2020-01-24 18:13:50,TweetDeck,43,99
Today’s the anniversary of #RoevWade &amp; it’s never been more important. Our right to make choices about our own bodies is under attack &amp; even the future of Roe is uncertain. That’s why we need the Women’s Health Protection Act to finally enshrine Roe in law for all of us! #RoeIRL,2020-01-22 18:15:42,Twitter for iPhone,5,31
Now that SCOTUS has upheld Trump's #MuslimBan he wants to go further. We know this has nothing to do w/ security &amp; everything to do w/ bigotry. That's why we need the #NoBanAct to repeal this ban and require actual evidence of a threat not just prejudice https://t.co/H8OgmkwUJr,2020-01-21 22:25:54,TweetDeck,17,37
The Senate is engaged in a cover up. No evidence. No witnesses. Forcing testimony into midnight hours when nobody is watching. These are not the actions of people who believe the President is innocent. This is the behavior of accomplices. #DefendOurDemocracy https://t.co/F21Yj0sV8u,2020-01-21 15:46:12,TweetDeck,86,200
