OTD four years ago this President took the time to celebrate teachers in a very special way. Today we are celebrating teachers for a very different reason. Thank you to all the educators out there as we kick off Teacher Appreciation Week!  You Rock!!! 📚 📖 📚 https://t.co/JAY2GQi47E,2020-05-04 02:01:02,Twitter for iPhone,197,1160

Productive mtg with all 41 DTC’s in CT05. While others are uniting “against their opponent”  (I guess that’s me 😉) @CTDems are uniting on the issues and brainstorming solutions to make the lives of people in this district better.  #thatswhatDemocratsdo https://t.co/HdU9CoGwXW,2020-05-01 17:24:07,Twitter for iPhone,3,25

I supported the CARES ACT and worked very hard to include legislation that would support everyday Americans and continue to advocate for you in this next package.   #Gaveltogavel,2020-04-20 16:40:12,Twitter for iPhone,0,16
For those interested your Rep. did not miss this vote. I was enroute and available for a vote had it been called. I was nursing flu like symptoms and had my 11 yr old with me so sitting on the floor or in the galley was not an option.,2020-04-20 16:40:11,Twitter for iPhone,0,18
Lots of questions about how I voted on the CARES ACT. This was a voice vote that was agreed to beforehand with bipartisan support. The yeas and neas were never called so there is no vote record.,2020-04-20 16:40:10,Twitter for iPhone,3,27
We’ve got work to do! Now it is more critically important than ever to make sure I keep this seat and we maintain the majority. Share and repost!!! Jahana Hayes 2020 https://t.co/cmJXAkwNgU,2020-04-20 01:26:52,Twitter for iPhone,17,52
