The majority of Pennsylvanians voted for @realDonaldTrump. They deserve to have their voices heard and we demand an open and transparent process. Gov. Wolf needs to stop politics and start a fair process.,2020-11-06 01:02:18,Twitter Web App,790,2847
Significant legal victory for @realDonaldTrump in Philly. GOP poll watchers are now permitted to review ballot counting. PA Gov's office more interested in the speed and quantity rather than the quality of ballots. Dems want to reverse decision. What are they hiding?,2020-11-05 17:37:11,Twitter Web App,13,38

Considered by Biden/Harris as a peaceful protest not violent. Chanting “Death to America” is far from peaceful. Biden’s tacit support encourages this. Not denouncing for political gain is cowardly and will backfire. #realDonaldTrump #WeThePeople https://t.co/5JZVm3wj9w,2020-09-07 17:21:05,Twitter Web App,7,6

A new DNC &amp; media low. Justice Kavanaugh=0 evidence and presumed guilty. Joe Biden=factual recorded evidence; adamantly declared innocent by the DNC &amp; media.

After this morning's devastating factual opening remarks by President's defense team the liberal mainstream media is already conceding/rationalizing why their “winning“ is unrealistic... people should demand an apology and vote out all proponents of this sham. #realDonaldTrump,2020-01-25 18:57:48,Twitter Web App,4,2
