Once someone decides to have an abortion it should be safe affordable and free from punishment stigma and judgment. Abortion access shouldn’t depend on your zip code race or socioeconomic status. We must pass #WHPA to ensure women’s access to abortion care. #ActForWomen,2020-02-12 17:12:50,Twitter Web App,4,15
Abortion is health care and health care is a human right. I believe ALL women should have access to safe affordable abortion services free from the interference of anti-choice politicians. That’s why I #ActForWomen and am an original cosponsor of #WHPA.,2020-02-12 17:12:50,Twitter Web App,6,23
FACT: the Women’s Health Protection Act will ensure women can access abortion care without unnecessary political interference.

Asian American women get paid $0.90 to as low as $0.50 per dollar that white men make. The House has voted for equal pay. The Senate must do the same. #AAPIEqualPay #PaycheckFairness https://t.co/HPgk5qSpzK,2020-02-11 19:32:08,Twitter Web App,6,5

Bottom-line: If we want everyone to have access to safe drinking water all of our streams and wetlands no matter how small should be protected from pollution. #DirtyWaterRule #ProtectCleanWater,2020-01-23 21:07:33,Twitter Web App,2,10
Too many communities throughout the country already can’t access safe reliable drinking water. The Trump administration’s #DirtyWaterRule will make that worse. #ProtectCleanWater,2020-01-23 21:07:33,Twitter Web App,5,7
By destroying clean water protections @realDonaldTrump and @EPAAWheeler aren't just endangering wetlands they are putting the drinking water of MILLIONS of Americans at risk of contamination! #ProtectCleanWater https://t.co/ShJa7equA4,2020-01-23 21:07:33,Twitter Web App,12,32
It’s been three years since the Trump Administration reinstated and radically expanded #globalgagrule to:  ❌silence providers and advocates ❌undermine health care access ❌roll back progress.  It’s time to end it once and for all. #NoGagRule! https://t.co/rvzobVdpa1,2020-01-23 15:36:55,Twitter Web App,15,43
While not visible traumatic brain injuries are just as devastating as other wounds suffered in war. I encourage our President to visit my impacted constituents and apologize to them and their families for his uninformed comments.  @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/6jj7dvFeZW,2020-01-22 21:29:09,Twitter Web App,44,109
Today on the anniversary of Roe abortion access is hanging on by a thread: unconstitutional state abortion bans courts stacked against us threats to overturn Roe. But that’s why I won’t stop fighting for our rights—because we CANNOT &amp; we WILL NOT go back @PPFA @AllAboveAll https://t.co/CNlIplTgLu,2020-01-22 17:07:35,Twitter Web App,14,25
Just a few weeks ago 200+ of my anti-choice colleagues in Congress told the court that #Roe is unworkable. But when 77% of Americans support abortion access it’s clear that reproductive freedom is far from “unworkable.” #7in10forRoe #RoeIRL,2020-01-22 17:07:34,Twitter Web App,6,20
I proudly stand with champions like @NARAL in the fight for reproductive freedom because we will NOT go back. Protecting and expanding this fundamental freedom is more urgent now than ever for every body. #7in10forRoe https://t.co/FxdnU9aKSL,2020-01-22 17:07:33,Twitter Web App,20,153
The NRA has too much influence over Washington politicians. On this anniversary of #CitizensUnited we say #EnoughIsEnough. It’s time to pass #HR1 and limit their influence over politicians.,2020-01-21 20:45:47,Twitter for iPhone,11,32
The impeachment oath DOES NOT allow for exceptions; it commands impartiality. McConnell must recuse.,2020-01-21 15:47:31,Twitter for iPhone,7,24
He is also severely biased - his wife works for Trump. In any federal case he'd be disqualified from serving as a juror,2020-01-21 15:47:30,Twitter for iPhone,7,19
He has already passed judgment on the case calling the Articles of Impeachment "weak" and promising "total coordination" with the defendant,2020-01-21 15:47:30,Twitter for iPhone,4,7
If McConnell takes his oath to "do impartial justice" seriously he must recuse himself   https://t.co/onqWc02RZC,2020-01-21 15:47:29,Twitter for iPhone,19,45
