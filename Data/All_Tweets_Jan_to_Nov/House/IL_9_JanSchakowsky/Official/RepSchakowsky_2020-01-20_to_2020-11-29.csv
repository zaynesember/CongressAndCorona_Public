While some are still focussed on the Smollett case @KimFoxxforSA is vacating convictions and standing up for our communities. The work she’s done as State’s Attorney has made a difference in our communities. She needs 4 more years.,2020-02-12 02:49:17,Twitter for iPhone,18,44

Dr. Davidson is right- this is about saving lives &amp; making people’s lives better. It’s clear we need Medicare for all but we also need to kick this administration out of power for their blatant yet dishonest attempts to cut Medicaid &amp; destroy the ACA. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/XIcPpqDwcr,2020-01-31 03:19:05,Twitter for iPhone,11,16
