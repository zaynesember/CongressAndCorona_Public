1/3 I rise this morning in defense of Governor Gavin Newsom who recently defied his own idiotic Covid edicts as he partied at one of the few restaurants that he has not yet forced out of business.,2020-11-19 18:18:49,Twitter Web App,237,952
2/3  I defend him because he was doing what we all once did in a free society: make our own decisions over what risks we are willing to run and what precautions we are willing to take according to our own circumstances to protect our own health.,2020-11-19 18:18:37,Twitter Web App,65,334
3/3 The governor SHOULD make his own decisions about running his own life.  I only ask that he and his ilk would stop telling the rest of us how to run ours.  Remarks: https://t.co/mZySJvw6Xq,2020-11-19 18:18:15,Twitter Media Studio,216,651

2/2 This is vital to assuring the legitimacy of the result. This process must be completed before anyone declares a victor.,2020-11-09 22:17:49,Twitter Web App,178,607
1/2 Votes are still being counted and there are serious allegations of illegal voting and illegal procedures that could affect the outcome of the presidential election.

1/2 I’m very concerned about election integrity. I remember the days when we all voted in person on election day. That’s why we called it ELECTION DAY. What they’ve done to our voting system is a travesty. It undermines confidence in the system and it opens the door to fraud.,2020-11-06 01:27:12,Twitter Web App,2681,6808

5/5 These laws were passed with the promise they would improve the forests. After more than four decades I think we are entitled to ask how are the forests doing?  Read Congressman McClintock's full House Floor remarks here: https://t.co/9CcvDoOhJT,2020-09-23 20:04:48,Twitter Web App,2,30
4/5 Really? These environmental laws generally apply only to public lands. Today you can easily tell the boundaries between private &amp; public lands solely by the condition of the forests. How clever of the climate only to decimate the public lands.,2020-09-23 20:04:48,Twitter Web App,1,26
3/5 We have been trying for years to reform these laws resume active forest management &amp; restore our forests to health. Yet the environmental leftists have blocked us every year. Instead politicians use the excuse of climate change.,2020-09-23 20:04:47,Twitter Web App,0,17
2/5 Draconian restrictions on logging grazing prescribed burns &amp; herbicide use on public lands have made modern land management endlessly time consuming &amp; ultimately cost prohibitive. A single tree thinning plan typically takes four years &amp; more than 800 pages of analysis.,2020-09-23 20:04:47,Twitter Web App,1,21
1/5 Last week President Trump came to CA to be briefed on the horrific fires raging in CA. Instead he got a lecture from Gov. Newsom &amp; his staff on climate change. Beginning in the 1970s we imposed environmental laws that have made the management of our lands all but impossible.,2020-09-23 20:04:47,Twitter Web App,12,52

"If Gavin Newsom actually believes that if we were to all just ride our bikes to work and set our thermostats to 80 degrees then these wildfires will go away he is completely delusional…" Interview via @Newsmax TV  https://t.co/XFrSlekpbA https://t.co/XXgunjHcWE,2020-09-17 23:48:16,Twitter Media Studio,201,357
4/4 The mismanagement has gotten to the point where you can now tell the boundary between private lands that are not affected by these laws &amp; the public lands that are.  Listen to Congressman McClintock discusses forest management on The John &amp; Ken Show: https://t.co/lwvbP3YZJQ,2020-09-17 01:34:51,Twitter Web App,97,242
3/4 We've had an 80% decline in timber harvested out of our federal forests since 1980 and we've had a concomitant increase in acreage destroyed by fire.,2020-09-17 01:34:51,Twitter Web App,90,253
2/4 Then in the 1970s we began imposing environmental laws that have made it all but impossible to carry out that timber. What we've seen over those decades is increasingly severe forest fires.,2020-09-17 01:34:50,Twitter Web App,85,225
1/4 Excess timber comes out of the forest in one of two ways it's either carried out or it burns out. We used to carry it out it was called logging. We had healthy forests and we had a thriving economy.,2020-09-17 01:34:50,Twitter Web App,707,1430
