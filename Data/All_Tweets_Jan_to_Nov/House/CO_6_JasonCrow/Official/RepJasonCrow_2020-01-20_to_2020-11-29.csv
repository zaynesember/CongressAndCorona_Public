I can't explain why I came home and some of my friends didn’t. But what I do know is that they were great Americans and we owe them a debt we can never repay.

Each time I was willing to give my life to keep that oath because I believed those presidents would try to do the right thing for the country. But we can’t say that about Trump and that’s why he puts both our troops and national security at great risk.,2020-09-04 14:02:24,Twitter Web App,53,202

Too many lives in our community have been touched by gun violence the last few weeks. No kid should have to go to school scared and I’m working to make that a reality. I’ve been fighting for universal background checks to close loopholes and to hold the gun industry accountable https://t.co/SaqlSsW4iG,2020-01-23 14:55:02,TweetDeck,139,655
President Trump betrayed US national security when he corruptly withheld aid. He did so because he wanted to help his own political campaign  Our men &amp; women in uniform deserve better  Our friends &amp; allies deserve better  The American people deserve better https://t.co/PYoHAbJZ7f,2020-01-22 23:41:31,TweetDeck,1911,5310
Coloradans shouldn’t have to choose between paying their rent &amp; filling a prescription. It’s time to rein in skyrocketing prescription drug costs so I’m helping to lead the Freedom From Price Gouging Act because we need to stand up to Big Pharma -- it passed the House this Fall! https://t.co/BZuEY4uoPz,2020-01-22 17:08:27,TweetDeck,59,254
Women’s health care decisions must be left to a patient her family and her doctor. Not by politicians in Washington. In the 47 years since #RoevWade was decided reproductive rights have continually been under attack. I’ll keep fighting to protect a woman's right to choose.,2020-01-22 16:37:29,TweetDeck,99,485
Only 8% of veterans in the VA health system can access VA dental services. Let's fix that. Visited the CU Heroes Clinic where @CUDentalMed is giving dental care to vets in the @CUSystem. It’s a national model- we just voted allowing the VA to run a pilot program to close the gap https://t.co/3Lii1yUk6x,2020-01-22 15:39:56,TweetDeck,38,139
Witnesses testified extensively about OMB’s involvement in carrying out the hold. It was OMB that relayed the President’s instructions and implemented the hold. And it was OMB that scrambled to justify the freeze.  It's time to subpoena those documents https://t.co/fJ7tjvqL8t,2020-01-22 00:59:28,TweetDeck,1030,2942
Before I was a member of Congress I was an American soldier serving in Iraq and Afghanistan.  When we talk about troops not getting the equipment that they need when they need it it's personal to me.  https://t.co/lmnro5RuBC,2020-01-22 00:38:25,TweetDeck,1036,3097
Since the Citizens United decision 10 years ago anonymous donors spent a BILLION dollars in our elections through “Dark Money”. My first bill was the End Dark Money Act because megadonors shouldn’t be able to hide their identity when they’re spending money on political campaigns https://t.co/nxes6Y3WXl,2020-01-21 17:40:23,Twitter Media Studio,207,607
McConnell is planning to run an impeachment trial:  - Without witnesses  - Without evidence  - In the middle of the night  That’s not a fair trial. It’s hardly a trial at all -- that’s a cover up.,2020-01-21 15:59:54,TweetDeck,1399,3421
Earlier this month I sent a letter urging the @DeptofDefense to rethink the proposal and maintain our national security by recommitting to our mission in Africa. Proud to work with @RepAnthonyBrown @RepJimmyPanetta @AustinScottGA08 and @RepRichHudson on this letter.,2020-01-20 22:35:22,Twitter for iPhone,38,119
The Administration’s proposal to cut our troops in Africa would diminish American leadership and weaken our national security by giving an opening to terrorist organizations such as ISIS. It’s also essential that we work with our allies to counter Chinese and Russian influence. https://t.co/PVdfuOq5v0,2020-01-20 22:35:21,Twitter for iPhone,770,874
Martin Luther King Jr. has been an inspiration and hero to generations of Americans. As we honor his legacy and find inspiration in his example we continue the fight for justice and equality for every American. #MLKDay https://t.co/2yZUjF3wby,2020-01-20 18:33:25,TweetDeck,34,135
The arts bring people together and foster communities. That’s one of the reasons I fight to fully fund the @NEArts. Proud to announce that 26 organizations in Colorado were just awarded NEA grants!  https://t.co/ORYiuaMTDk,2020-01-20 01:44:04,Twitter for iPhone,8,67
