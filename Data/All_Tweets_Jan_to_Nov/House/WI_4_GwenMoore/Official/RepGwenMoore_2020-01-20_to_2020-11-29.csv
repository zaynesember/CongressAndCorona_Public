Every year an estimated $441 billion taxes due aren’t paid (the tax gap). Enforcement efforts reduce this by $40B. Much of tax gap is driven by the rich flouting the rules.

Every year 4 million women give birth and nearly half of them are on Medicaid. The #MamasFirstAct aims to make the most impact by ensuring more mothers have access to these critical services. #MaternalJustice (2/2),2020-02-25 02:22:23,Twitter Web App,14,29
Mothers of color are bearing the worst birth outcomes from the maternal mortality crisis. These disparities are harming their health and costing many their lives. I knew I had to act. #MaternalJustice  (1/2) https://t.co/MMzu9WpSmt,2020-02-25 02:22:23,Twitter Web App,42,64
A7: In Milwaukee 100 new mothers in underserved areas will receive doulas as part of a pilot program. Expanding access to these services is critical given that black mothers are 3-5x more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than white mothers. #MaternalJustice https://t.co/OxIvz8tCWj,2020-02-25 02:13:13,Twitter Web App,5,14
@KateWoeber Here's a link to my press release on the legislation: https://t.co/AS4rBG9QyT,2020-02-25 01:49:19,Twitter Web App,1,5
That’s why we need to continue using this data to advocate and drive policies that expand access to these services for mothers of color. #MaternalJustice (2/2),2020-02-25 01:48:09,Twitter Web App,2,4
The extensive research on this topic confirms that utilizing doulas/midwives results in lower c-sections better birth weights and positive birth outcomes for mothers and their babies. #MaternalJustice (1/2) https://t.co/QVpMtsIKvf,2020-02-25 01:48:08,Twitter Web App,10,24
A4: For a doula or midwife providing culturally competent care is based on understanding the unique challenges that mothers face considering the needs of their community and grasping a mother’s social and cultural values. #MaternalJustice https://t.co/wikmKPDAJs,2020-02-25 01:40:20,Twitter Web App,10,13
This will help usher in more doulas/midwives from diverse backgrounds. #MaternalJustice (3/3),2020-02-25 01:29:08,Twitter Web App,2,12
I introduced a bill to strengthen the pipeline and build on the diversity our maternal health care sector needs. My legislation would ensure that low-income women (who qualify for TANF) can receive training and education to become a doula or midwife. #MaternalJustice (2/3),2020-02-25 01:29:08,Twitter Web App,5,25
A3: A lack of access to educational opportunity is a driving factor. Doulas also often receive low reimbursement rates which can keep women from different economic backgrounds out of these careers including women of color. #MaternalJustice (1/3) https://t.co/DzyLU9romh,2020-02-25 01:29:08,Twitter Web App,6,31
A2: Every woman needs to be heard in the doctor’s office. Unfortunately many Black women voice their concerns only to be dismissed. A doula or midwife can provide support that ensures all their needs are met which can put mothers at ease through the pregnancy. #MaternalJustice https://t.co/CO9vQWEpyK,2020-02-25 01:24:26,Twitter Web App,8,18
Many Black women bear scars of trauma from experiences in hospitals and want to empower themselves and other mothers.   These services fill gaps in care by providing holistic support that can be missing in a medical setting. #MaternalJustice (2/2),2020-02-25 01:21:40,Twitter Web App,6,17
A1: Mothers of color are witnessing and sometimes experiencing the maternal mortality crisis and are returning to these careers so other mothers have access to care that can lead to a safe and natural pregnancy. #MaternalJustice (1/2) https://t.co/79WypA0PR2,2020-02-25 01:21:39,Twitter Web App,7,16

Another enhancement to Social Security in my bill is extending the benefit eligibility for children of retired disabled or deceased workers who are full-time students up to the age of 26 or older. Students of color and low-income families especially need this support. (4/4),2020-01-31 19:26:31,Twitter Web App,5,11
Older women can be especially financially vulnerable and that’s why my bill would modify the special minimum benefit to credit workers for up to five additional years of work to reflect the years workers provide care for a child under 6 years old. Mother’s work is work. (3/4),2020-01-31 19:26:31,Twitter Web App,6,13
We must protect its solvency and make key changes. Social Security is the only real means of retirement funding for many seniors – but is woefully inadequate.

SNAP is merely a supplement to help people meet their needs. Struggling people still struggle. That’s why these cuts to SNAP are so detrimental.
