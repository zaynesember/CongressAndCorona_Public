The Trump campaign’s motives are crystal clear: they want to disenfranchise hundreds of thousands of voters who voted following clear guidance from the Wisconsin Elections Commission given under the law.  We can’t let that happen.  https://t.co/A3SB21y4ln,2020-11-24 20:22:20,Twitter Web App,3,5
.@JoeBiden won Wisconsin by more than 20000 votes.   Now Donald Trump is trying to change the rules to subvert the will of the people and throw out hundreds of thousands of legally-cast ballots. We won’t let him disenfranchise the people of Wisconsin. https://t.co/1rPPfiqG7f,2020-11-20 19:36:43,Twitter for iPhone,4,8
