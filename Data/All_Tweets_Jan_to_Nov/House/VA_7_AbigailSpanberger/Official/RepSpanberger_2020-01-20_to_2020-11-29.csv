Community healthcare providers in #VA07 alerted me to the issue and I started working to rally bipartisan support for protecting #340B. Today 216 Members of Congress – from both parties – signed on to my letter demanding that HHS protect the prescription drug discounts.,2020-11-13 21:12:07,Twitter Web App,5,26
Big pharmaceutical companies have teamed up with the company Kalderos to try to change the rules of the #340B program – without the approval of Congress or HHS. Their changes would drive up prescription drug prices for the types of healthcare providers I mentioned above. #VA07,2020-11-13 21:12:07,Twitter Web App,2,21
The types of providers that depend on #340B discounts include Federally Qualified Health Centers rural hospitals Ryan White HIV/AIDS clinics and safety-net clinics serving low-income Virginians. These places serve some of the most vulnerable people in #VA07.,2020-11-13 21:12:07,Twitter Web App,2,10
The #340B program was created by law. In exchange for getting their drugs covered by Medicaid healthcare plans the program requires drug companies to give discounts to healthcare providers that serve at-risk Americans. #VA07,2020-11-13 21:12:06,Twitter Web App,1,14

This is only one of the ways that the Lower Drug Costs Now Act would fight rising drug prices. The bill also gives Medicare Part D the power to negotiate directly with drug companies and those lower prices would also be available to Americans with private insurance.

The AIM price is a volume-weighted average of the price of prescription drugs in Australia Canada France Germany Japan &amp; the United Kingdom.

For drug price negotiations between PBMs and big pharmaceutical companies in the United States the Lower Drug Costs Now Act would set the max price at 120% of the average international market or AIM price. (3/5),2020-10-22 19:09:47,Twitter Web App,0,1
Why does it matter what someone pays for a prescription drug in another country?  The Lower Drug Costs Now Act which I cosponsored and voted to pass would set max prices for U.S. drugs based on average prices in comparable countries. (2/5),2020-10-22 19:09:47,Twitter Web App,0,0

Amid the partisan rhetoric we can't lose sight of what the #ACA actually means to Americans.

Under the #ACA states were allowed to expand the number of Americans eligible for Medicaid. In #VA07 alone that meant about 50000 people finally got health insurance. About 3000 of them were finally able to get help with an addiction and hundreds were treated for cancer.,2020-10-15 15:41:50,Twitter Web App,14,53

When we vote we must vote on a bill that can pass the Senate become law and deliver relief to the Americans who need it. We’ve done it four times during this crisis and we must again.

This year the IRS has been late in delivering refunds to millions of families. These delayed refunds accumulate interest and that interest is taxable – essentially penalizing Americans for a delay out of their control. The FAIR FIGHT Act would fix this flaw in our tax code. https://t.co/yTSOsxBt7m,2020-09-30 14:30:43,Twitter Web App,11,39
I'm proud to introduce this commonsense legislation with @RodneyDavis. The FAIR FIGHT Act would ensure that working families aren't taxed on a delay that was the IRS's fault to begin with.

Last year #Medicaid expansion allowed 23000 newly eligible Virginians to get help for substance abuse.

In 2018 federal investments in clean energy R&amp;D added $53 million in value to Virginia's economy contributed $11 million in total tax revenue and supported jobs across the Commonwealth.

No matter what the White House says junk plans are not a replacement for the Affordable Care Act. For one thing they discriminate by gender.

In crises past we've seen that our strongest national bonds are not based on fear but on a shared commitment to American ideals.

In November the Supreme Court will hear arguments on an administration-backed lawsuit to dismantle our current healthcare system. The #ACA closed the Medicare Part D Coverage Gap which has helped seniors pay for prescriptions – but that gap could return if the ACA is repealed. https://t.co/k9P6EdQ26f,2020-09-24 19:17:45,Twitter Web App,7,16
If the administration succeeds in scrapping the #ACA Medicare Part D could be weakened. Thousands of seniors could be downgraded to a skeleton of their previous benefits.

Instead of being forthright with Congress and the American people the administration continues to hide key information about how U.S. military aid to Saudi Arabia is resulting in civilian deaths in Yemen.

A cover-up is usually not a strong indicator of innocence. The White House's justification for aiding Saudi Arabian military action in Yemen has always been weak.

In July I introduced a bipartisan bill to limit the expansion of the 2001 #AUMF so that it is not used to justify deployments of U.S. servicemembers into new foreign countries. https://t.co/by6XqhNDtH,2020-09-18 19:42:06,Twitter Web App,1,4
For nearly 20 years the 2001 #AUMF has been expanded and abused to justify U.S. military actions in new countries beyond its original intent – each time without a public debate or a vote in Congress. This could happen again with Kenya or other countries.,2020-09-18 19:42:06,Twitter Web App,1,3
Just this week it was reported that there is a push to add Kenya to the list of countries where U.S. military action is justified under the 2001 #AUMF – potentially even for preemptive offensive strikes. https://t.co/Nt1lukbddM,2020-09-18 19:42:05,Twitter Web App,1,2
Over the years the 60 words that make up the 2001 #AUMF have been stretched far beyond their intended purpose.

The closure of the U.S. Consulate in Chengdu China weakens our ability to monitor ongoing human rights abuses against #Uyghurs the people of #Tibet and other persecuted groups in western China.

The bipartisan legislation I'm supporting would eliminate penalties and increase the opportunities for rural utility companies to refinance.

For years Congress has let presidents from both parties use the 2001 #AUMF as a blank check for sending Americans into conflicts.  That must change.  We owe it to our troops to vote on the use of military force as required by the Constitution. https://t.co/MlTGibr6w7,2020-07-14 18:35:40,Twitter Web App,7,30
This move underscores the need for vigilance when it comes to #Huawei and other tech firms tied to the Chinese government. As #5G networks grow we need laws – like my Secure 5G and Beyond Act – that proactively address threats to American data &amp; privacy. https://t.co/LdcUOC3jeN,2020-07-14 17:44:20,Twitter Web App,346,377

The 2001 #AUMF has been used as a blank check tangling American troops in conflicts all over the globe with no debate or discussion.

Free &amp; low-cost clinics are vital to thousands of uninsured families in Virginia. As COVID-19 persists we cannot forget the ongoing needs of Americans at EVERY income level.

I thank my colleagues @RepElaineLuria @RobWittman &amp; @RepRiggleman for their work on this bill. COVID-19 has made it even clearer that computer access is vital for keeping up in the digital economy. Our bill would close the #DigitalDivide for more veterans seniors &amp; students.,2020-07-10 23:00:52,Twitter Web App,4,18
Today I introduced a bill to allow old government computers to be refurbished and put to use by Americans in need.

Congressional authorization of military engagement is our constitutional duty. We owe it to every U.S. servicemember &amp; military family to have a public debate on the use of force. Members of Congress should have to be on the record before sending Americans into harm's way. #AUMF https://t.co/RdFujHwd3O,2020-07-10 15:53:22,Twitter Web App,11,28
This week I introduced bipartisan legislation to limit the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force. The AUMF is older than some current U.S. troops and has been used to justify engaging in hostilities a continent away from its original scope. https://t.co/M8vR2REQJX,2020-07-10 15:51:28,Twitter Web App,14,42
We have to make a concerted effort to reduce corruption &amp; rebuild trust between the American people and their elected officials.

TikTok may seem harmless but its ties to the Chinese government make it a national security risk.

These reports of Russian aggression aren't the first which makes it all the more mystifying why the president would continue treating a dangerous adversary like a trusted friend and why a potential threat on American lives wouldn't merit his attention. https://t.co/9MVe6bPzPC,2020-07-08 22:42:36,Twitter for iPhone,57,160

Today's @HouseForeign subcommittee hearing focused on how reports of bounties on U.S. soldiers fit a long pattern of escalation by a dangerous adversary.

We must get to the bottom of these reports and we must do so quickly. We cannot in either party politicize the safety of our troops. It is potentially life and death for our servicemen &amp; women deployed overseas and for their families back home in #VA07 and across the country. https://t.co/xk7a1q3iZA,2020-07-01 14:52:52,Twitter Web App,25,112
I want to see a full denounciation of Russian aggression from the administration — not attempts to bring Russia back to the G8.

The most serious duty of the President of the United States is to protect American lives. That should come before everything else.

To make it into the president's daily brief information must be deemed urgent &amp; credible at many levels of our government.

Our national security should never be a partisan issue. Every Member of Congress should have access to this information not just Members of the President’s party.

Tomorrow morning I’ll attend a White House briefing on reports of Russian bounties for killing U.S. servicemembers in Afghanistan. If these reports are confirmed we need all the facts to keep our troops safe from this disturbing threat.,2020-06-30 01:00:30,Twitter for iPhone,173,1220
For thousands of our neighbors in #VA07 the existing healthcare law is their only lifeline to care they can afford.

If there are problems in our healthcare system we should fix them no doubt about it. But there is nothing solutions-oriented about recklessly endangering Americans with pre-existing conditions bringing back lifetime caps or kicking young people off their parents' insurance.,2020-06-29 23:31:50,Twitter Web App,6,23
Another example: a 50-year-old couple with a 25-year-old adult child making $85533 per year currently pays $1793 per month in premiums or 25.15% of their income. Under this bill they would pay $606 per month — a savings of $14246 a year.,2020-06-29 23:31:50,Twitter Web App,2,8
Under this bill no middle class family would pay more than 8.5% of their income for a silver plan in the health insurance marketplace. For a 40-year-old couple with two kids in Henrico making $103258 per year that means monthly premiums would go from $1594 to $731.,2020-06-29 23:31:50,Twitter Web App,2,7
The legislation I helped pass today received support from both Republicans and Democrats. The bipartisan bill would protect coverage for Americans with pre-existing conditions. It would also help lower healthcare costs for working families in #VA07. Here's how —,2020-06-29 23:31:50,Twitter Web App,2,5
Today I voted to protect coverage for those with pre-existing conditions — and I'll keep doing so as long as the Trump administration keeps trying to gut the coverage that millions of Virginians need to access lifesaving care for cancer diabetes &amp; more. https://t.co/OKQHBlyzYc,2020-06-29 23:31:49,Twitter Web App,17,80
Rather than allocating food assistance to each state proportionally @USDA recently used a new formula that cut the amount Virginia food banks receive by millions of pounds. I'm pushing for answers on why and how this change was made. https://t.co/EMbIUAvDXd,2020-06-29 19:40:47,Twitter Web App,13,25
Groups like @VAFoodBanks @FeedMoreInc and @healthyculpeper are working around the clock to feed vulnerable neighbors in #VA07.

H.R. 1112 @WhipClyburn's bill to close the #CharlestonLoophole passed the House with bipartisan support in February 2019 – it continues to sit in the Senate without a vote. Racism continues to impact every area of our nation's life from policing to health to education. (2/3),2020-06-17 21:25:36,Twitter Web App,5,16

2. Justice for Victims of Lynching Act and the Emmett Till Antilynching Act. I'm a cosponsor of these bills which would establish new criminal penalties for lynching.

For weeks I’ve been asking @HHSGov to release these already-approved funds. This is progress but the amount falls far short of what caretakers have desperately requested. They NEED more help to test and care for our seniors in the weeks to come.  https://t.co/KXB2UVfwuc,2020-05-22 19:27:35,Twitter Web App,6,10

The #VA07 people &amp; counties I serve expect us to work together to provide REAL relief in this crisis. This bill strays far beyond delivering relief or responding to an urgent crisis &amp; it has no chance at becoming law. I'll be voting no on the HEROES Act. https://t.co/lmzEZsUpoo,2020-05-15 14:18:29,Twitter Web App,32,128

We can reduce the risk to our health &amp; national security by reducing our dependence on China for pharmaceuticals. Both bills are led by both a Republican and Democrat. I'll be working across the aisle to get these pragmatic bipartisan measures to the president's desk. (5/5),2020-05-13 20:49:15,Twitter Web App,2,19
The next bill would require @DeptofDefense to buy American-made ingredients medicines and vaccines for the purpose of treating our troops. China is our second largest supplier of pharmaceuticals. Buying American reduces our dependence and addresses a major security risk. (4/5),2020-05-13 20:49:15,Twitter Web App,2,17
The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed critical vulnerabilities in our drug supply chain. By harnessing the innovation of American students researchers and companies we can make our pharmaceutical manufacturers more resilient and competitive. (3/5),2020-05-13 20:49:14,Twitter Web App,0,1
The first bill would allow @US_FDA to partner with American universities and private companies to develop continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing technology. This technology lowers production costs and reduces the interruptions that lead to drug shortages. (2/5),2020-05-13 20:49:14,Twitter Web App,0,1

Today the Armenian community in Central Virginia and across the globe commemorates the lives lost in the #ArmenianGenocide. This anniversary is a terrible reminder of atrocities born from blind hate but it also reminds us how enduring the human spirit can be.,2020-04-25 00:49:22,Twitter for iPhone,33,112
Did every priority issue make it into this bill? No. In future negotiations I will keep fighting to secure overlooked support that #VA07 needs - like emergency aid for farmers urgent assistance to our counties and the elimination of restrictive PPP red tape. Stay tuned.,2020-04-24 18:33:20,Twitter Web App,1,4
Of that $25 billion $11 billion is specifically allocated to state and local governments for their testing efforts. In Virginia and across the country local leaders are trying to ramp up their efforts to conduct widespread testing and contact tracing - these funds will help.,2020-04-24 18:33:20,Twitter Web App,2,1
2. $75 billion to reimburse hospitals and healthcare providers for coronavirus expenses such as PPE or increased staffing. The new law also includes $25 billion specifically designated for COVID-19 testing efforts.,2020-04-24 18:33:20,Twitter Web App,1,0
The idea behind targeting that funding is to ensure that rural businesses minority-owned businesses &amp; other underserved businesses have greater access to PPP loans. This new law also allocates an extra $50 billion to the EIDL program – another vital tool for small businesses.,2020-04-24 18:33:19,Twitter Web App,1,1
1. $310 billion for small businesses in Central Virginia and across the country. This amount will go to several different programs including PPP. Within the PPP chunk of money $60 billion is specifically set aside small &amp; mid-sized banks credit unions and CDFIs.,2020-04-24 18:33:19,Twitter Web App,2,1
Yesterday House Democrats &amp; Republicans came together to pass a fourth COVID-19 response package which addresses urgent needs like PPP funding. President Trump signed the bill into law today.

This bill delivers relief that #VA07 needs right now – including billions of additional dollars for PPP loans EIDL loans and COVID-19 testing. We have lots of work ahead but I'm heartened to see the House working together to pass this bill by 388-5. https://t.co/zGnG9A1rsE,2020-04-24 17:54:15,Twitter Web App,8,27

PPP is a lifeline for our small businesses and we need to deliver more funding immediately. Once we address this urgent need I'll focus on fighting for the items that didn't make it into today's bill like support for county-level efforts. #VA07 https://t.co/CgUkifR1tI,2020-04-23 19:29:32,Twitter Web App,6,18
Heading to the floor now. I'll be voting in favor of strong additional PPP funding. This program has already aided many Central Virginians - I've heard it called a "lifeline." We must keep this lifeline open to the business owners &amp; workers at the heart of our #VA07 economy. https://t.co/x3iVrw10IU,2020-04-23 18:17:24,Twitter Web App,43,186

Today's conversation was just the start. American farmers are as essential to weathering this crisis as doctors – in good times and bad everybody still needs to eat. I'll continue to gather feedback and advocate for our #VA07 ag producers in future COVID-19 response bills. (3/4),2020-04-22 23:00:00,Twitter Web App,6,13
There is still much work that needs to be done to support our nation's ag producers - particularly dairy &amp; livestock producers. I've written to @SecretarySonny requesting specific emergency assistance for cattlemen who have been particularly hard-hit by this crisis. (2/4),2020-04-22 23:00:00,Twitter Web App,0,5
Today I held a virtual meeting to hear from Central Virginia's farmers growers producers &amp; agribusiness leaders.

For #VA07 small business owners their business is more than a building or a sign out front – it’s their dream. I strongly urge my colleagues in both parties to put aside political games and work together to fund essential relief through PPP and EIDL. (3/3),2020-04-16 21:13:01,Twitter Web App,2,10
The PPP and EIDL programs need additional funding ASAP and this process cannot be mired in partisan attacks and federal bureaucracy. Both parties need to work together quickly to fund programs that are making a tangible difference to #VA07 business owners. (2/3),2020-04-16 21:13:01,Twitter Web App,10,23
.@SBAgov has closed applications for PPP and EIDL loans due to lapsed funding.

I'm fighting to include measures in the next #Coronavirus response package designed to lower rising premiums. https://t.co/zDm30wuJyG,2020-04-07 18:36:12,Twitter Web App,4,22
I've written to @SecAzar and @SeemaCMS yet again on the administration's choice to not open a special enrollment period. The pandemic is still spreading. Family finances are strained. The harder we make it for Americans to afford medical treatment the more we prolong the pain. https://t.co/H5Qj8KzrfV,2020-04-07 17:28:40,Twitter Web App,21,60
#VA07 I'll be doing another Facebook Live video on the latest coronavirus information and efforts at 3:30 pm ET. I hope many of you can tune in to hear today's updates. Head over to my Facebook page at 3:30. 💻   https://t.co/in9KFTk8vM,2020-04-07 16:49:39,Twitter Web App,2,5
Today I wrote to @SBAgov and @USTreasury to demand that they issue updated clear guidance to PPP lenders and make sure this program runs smoothly for #VA07 businesses. (2/2) https://t.co/p5nEYEF248,2020-04-07 16:12:07,Twitter Web App,6,15
#VA07 small business owners have been calling my office. I was angered to hear from them that contrary to the bipartisan bill sent to the president's desk PPP lenders have been adding additional steps that prevent them from getting loans. (1/2) https://t.co/BQx6SbMYXm,2020-04-07 16:12:06,Twitter Web App,14,32
Small business owners have called my office worried because they can't get a PPP loan. I'm calling on @SBAgov and @USTreasury to immediately clarify their guidance to PPP lenders so this program can work smoothly and #VA07 can receive economic relief. https://t.co/p5nEYEF248,2020-04-07 15:51:10,Twitter Web App,12,21
As the #CoronavirusPandemic continues to unfold it's clear that Congress will have to revisit the evolving needs of our small business owners working families and healthcare professionals. Both parties have been guilty of pushing partisan legislation - that must end now. ⬇️ https://t.co/NR82WbvGd4,2020-04-06 22:47:12,Twitter Web App,9,25
His demonstrated lack of leadership is yet another reason why our nation’s agencies and departments cannot be run by unconfirmed acting individuals. https://t.co/EK0QioJZdI,2020-04-06 20:11:31,Twitter Web App,31,99
Acting Navy Secretary Modly’s rant to the sailors aboard the USS Roosevelt demonstrates he is not fit to lead the Navy. @EsperDoD should remove him immediately. https://t.co/bvPNcGPeYR,2020-04-06 20:11:12,Twitter Web App,81,185
My team and I have put together a guide to help #VA07 families navigate questions like:  - How much will my direct payment be?  - How are 17 year olds counted?  - Which unemployment programs cover self-employed gig and tipped workers?

Thank you @NationalCorn for having me and thank you @RepDustyJohnson for a robust conversation! It feels like a lifetime ago but the same values of bipartisanship and no-nonsense practicality that we discussed are even more important during this crisis. https://t.co/Iyv5RGwaTa,2020-04-06 17:32:32,Twitter Web App,5,9
We can &amp; should support American manufacturers but there simply aren't enough #PPE supplies domestically to meet the need. That's why I'm urging @USTradeRep to suspend Section 301 tariffs on imported PPE and medical supplies. The #CoronavirusPandemic is not business as usual. https://t.co/bZINpT52nF,2020-04-03 17:31:06,Twitter Web App,15,60

After widespread bipartisan concern @IRS has reversed their decision. Social Security beneficiaries who aren't typically required to file tax returns will NOT need to file to receive the $1200. I'm glad to see a common-sense change that will deliver relief to Americans faster. https://t.co/DSqlAGOyht,2020-04-02 20:16:15,Twitter Web App,11,40

This contradicts the bipartisan bill the president just signed into law. More than 25 million Americans over 60 live in poverty. Many more lack the savings to endure a lengthy crisis. Creating unnecessary red tape to keep them from getting relief is wrong. https://t.co/z6hrBIvOwC,2020-04-01 22:00:00,TweetDeck,17,26
Yesterday I spoke with #VA07 doctors about what they're seeing in their practices and how patients are faring. Every day I speak with as many Virginians on the front lines of this crisis as possible and I keep hearing the same thing  – We need help. We need PPE. #DPA https://t.co/GSs5f6ghBl,2020-04-01 19:43:14,Twitter Web App,14,56
You can complete a very important simple process today to help your #VA07 neighbors!  Step 1: Stay home.  Step 2: Take 10 minutes to complete the census.   Powhatan County has set the bar high.

Distilleries in #VA07 have the ingredients and the packaging to meet a critical need in our communities. That's why I'm urging @US_FDA to quickly update their rules to allow for distilleries producing an effective safe hand sanitizer recipe. https://t.co/MOHnIZPP6x,2020-03-30 19:48:28,Twitter Web App,15,36
My colleagues and I are working to get @US_FDA to update their rules for hand sanitizer production.

We've already experienced heartbreaking loss in #VA07 nursing homes and the danger is rising.  I will not stop my efforts to get our nursing home and long-term care workers the PPE they need. Yesterday I took this vital request directly to @SecAzar. https://t.co/CtLOPVGV9X,2020-03-28 13:30:00,TweetDeck,22,83
1. The Governor would retain his authority to deploy units to our communities.  2. @VaNationalGuard units would provide practical and logistical support to coronavirus response efforts.  3. The federal govt. would cover the cost of these critical missions. (2/2),2020-03-27 23:24:28,Twitter Web App,3,16
Today I asked the administration to quickly approve federal funding for the @VaNationalGuard to combat the #CoronavirusPandemic. National Guard resources can help deliver vital support to our communities quickly and efficiently. (1/2) https://t.co/guSSyC52KC,2020-03-27 23:24:28,Twitter Web App,9,33
YOU can make this happen.  Not by tweeting but by invoking the Defense Production Act (DPA).  It's beyond time for real action and leadership that would increase U.S. production of the medical supplies that health workers in Virginia and beyond so desperately need. #MasksNow https://t.co/Fwip8c27lY,2020-03-27 19:12:16,Twitter Web App,334,1025
6. An additional $10 billion for @SBAgov’s disaster loan program through end of 2020.   Those are the takeaways from this package. Do we need to continue working to strengthen &amp; expand aid for everyday Americans? Absolutely and I'm glad we got started with some key wins today.,2020-03-27 18:21:03,Twitter Web App,1,4
5. Creation of a new Paycheck Protection Program. It protects workers by offering small businesses loan forgiveness on @SBAgov loans for payroll costs rent utilities mortgage interest etc.  AS LONG AS They don't fire employees or cut their pay.,2020-03-27 18:21:02,Twitter Web App,2,4
4. $349 billion in low-interest forgivable loans for any business with 500 or fewer employees (also available during a covered period for independent contractors self-employed workers and sole proprietors.),2020-03-27 18:21:02,Twitter Web App,0,2
2. An additional $600 per week in emergency unemployment assistance to everyone currently receiving unemployment benefits.  3. A new unemployment program for those not traditionally eligible like the self-employed &amp; gig-economy workers. Payments would continue through 7/31/2020.,2020-03-27 18:21:02,Twitter Web App,0,4
1. Direct payments of $1200 to all Americans with individual incomes up to $75K (married couples with incomes up to $150K would get $2400.) Additional $500 per child.  We must consider additional aid for working families moving forward but this is a necessary first step.,2020-03-27 18:21:02,Twitter Web App,0,2
The House just passed the CARES Act. This is the third package of #CoronavirusPandemic response legislation we've passed this month and it won't be the last step. See the thread below for details on what this bill delivers for #VA07 ⬇️ https://t.co/vQAVrUMHR4,2020-03-27 18:21:01,Twitter Web App,7,22
The CARES Act isn't perfect but it provides aid that people need TODAY - not in a distant future after both parties have wasted more time on political theater. This bill delivers forgivable loans &amp; grants for small businesses direct payments and boosted unemployment insurance. https://t.co/vLOndmSCwV,2020-03-27 16:46:24,Twitter Web App,17,83
I will vote for the third #coronavirus response package because it delivers - Direct payments to workers - Expanded unemployment insurance - Low-interest small business loans  I won't let the perfect be the enemy of the good when my constituents need help NOW. #CARESActStatement https://t.co/773vxUKtWr,2020-03-27 15:57:55,Twitter Web App,44,203
Thank you to my colleagues @RodneyDavis and @StaceyPlaskett for fighting for our rural communities &amp; leading this effort alongside me.   @AjitPaiFCC and the @FCC should take action to make sure every student in #VA07 and across the country has equal access to opportunity. https://t.co/AE9yiPfrBf,2020-03-26 21:07:52,Twitter for iPhone,14,30
In our letter we’re calling on the @FCC to waive certain E-Rate program rules.    This change would allow the FCC to supply funding to rural schools to provide home WiFi to existing school devices as well as WiFi hotspots for students who lack access.   https://t.co/CzlsRXkx6J,2020-03-26 21:06:03,Twitter for iPhone,4,17

The rising cost of prescription drugs is putting a severe strain on family budgets in Virginia and across the country. No American should have to choose between filling a necessary prescription or buying groceries. Read more: https://t.co/JV23YPYjGL https://t.co/CUxeWZ9F3u,2020-02-27 22:00:00,TweetDeck,5,18
Today in the House we held a moment of silence to honor the legacy of Katherine Johnson. Johnson was a trailblazing mathematician who shattered barriers during her 3 decades with @NASA.

Thousands of Central Virginians have seen extreme price hikes on the medications they need most. In December I helped pass the Lower Drug Costs Now Act which would reverse years of price hikes on medications for conditions like diabetes.  The Senate still hasn't voted on it. https://t.co/msKtjoEHBA,2020-02-27 00:00:00,TweetDeck,9,22
As this public health emergency rapidly intensifies federal agencies must be ready to confront a wide range of potential scenarios.

This afternoon I spoke to credit union leaders from across Virginia about the vital role credit unions play in local &amp; regional economies. Their services strengthen the financial security of many #VA07 families and I thank @VACUL for the chance to speak and exchange ideas. https://t.co/b0PomWRHPm,2020-02-26 18:21:22,Twitter Web App,5,18
This month I wrote to ITC Chairman Johanson to urge him to protect a quarter of a million American jobs - including many in #VA07 - from the continued impacts of Chinese cabinet imports flooding the U.S. market.

Forestry creates jobs that underpin local economies in rural areas employing nearly 3 million Americans in all. We can protect these jobs by investing in research. Innovative research has already found new applications for wood in the food electronics &amp; biomedical industries.,2020-02-26 15:47:19,Twitter Web App,1,9
Despite the irreplaceable environmental social and economic benefits that forests provide the industry is facing many challenges. We've seen a decline in demand for wood products due to the heavy use of plastics slowed housing construction the rise of digital products etc.,2020-02-26 15:47:19,Twitter Web App,2,11
Forests are a pillar of prosperity in #VA07 and across the country. In Virginia alone forestry accounts for  🌲 15 million acres of forested land  🌲 $17 billion annually in the state economy 🌲 More than 100000 jobs https://t.co/UdDiFGaAnk,2020-02-26 15:47:19,Twitter Web App,5,23

For many Virginians with chronic conditions being able to afford their prescriptions is the difference between being able to go to school earn a living &amp; raise their families - or not. We cannot lessen our efforts to pass practical bipartisan bills that address this crisis. https://t.co/PrtOFNz5f7,2020-02-25 20:00:00,TweetDeck,8,27

The president's budget – in addition to slashing Social Security cutting Medicare and hindering FEMA's emergency preparedness efforts – would make deep cuts to the USDA programs that work to expand broadband access for rural Central Virginians. https://t.co/dHpHxyAw7Q,2020-02-11 21:27:58,Twitter Web App,13,17
4️⃣ In the House rural broadband has been a rare area of bipartisanship. I've worked with colleagues like @RodneyDavis to expand internet access for rural businesses farms &amp; schools. But while we work to get this done the president's budget guts the very programs we need. https://t.co/RIEHR90RDU,2020-02-11 21:27:57,Twitter Web App,12,21
3️⃣ It cuts some of the very efforts that are most effective in keeping Americans safe. The president's proposed budget slashes @fema federal assistance by nearly $747 million - this includes grants that state &amp; local communities use to address terror threats &amp; natural disasters.,2020-02-11 21:27:56,Twitter Web App,4,8
2️⃣ Loud and clear it tells Central Virginia seniors "you aren't a priority." The president's budget slashes Social Security by $24 billion and would cut Medicare by $550 billion. These are some of the programs seniors in #VA07 depend on the most. https://t.co/BS18EY1YKH,2020-02-11 21:27:56,Twitter Web App,5,10
My takeaways from the president's budget: 1️⃣ It's not fiscally responsible. Despite deep cuts to the programs Central Virginians depend on the most like Social Security our national debt would reach $30 trillion under the White House's proposed budget. https://t.co/FZYEXZxQDx,2020-02-11 21:27:54,Twitter Web App,18,59
The president's budget is a reflection of his priorities - and once again those priorities don't include  🚫 Social Security 🚫 Medicare 🚫 FEMA’s terror threat &amp; disaster preparedness efforts 🚫 USDA's investment in rural high-speed internet https://t.co/dHpHxyAw7Q,2020-02-11 21:19:37,Twitter Web App,29,63
I recently joined a letter working to prevent energy price spikes. In December @FERC told @pjminterconnect to create a price floor for clean energy sources.

#ICYMI Last week the Taxpayers Right to Know Act passed unanimously. I cosponsored this bipartisan bill which would help pinpoint sources of wasteful government spending.

I'm proud to support the Securing America's Ports Act a bipartisan bill that works to get that number up to 100%. By increasing our use of nonintrusive inspection systems we can scan more vehicles entering the U.S. and stem the flow of drugs and weapons.,2020-02-10 23:57:37,Twitter Web App,4,30
Currently Customs and Border Protection only scans 15% of commercial trucks and 1% of passenger vehicles entering the United States at land ports of entry. This allows more contraband like drugs and weapons to enter our communities in #VA07 and across the country.,2020-02-10 23:57:37,Twitter Web App,11,40
This latest news on the Equifax breach is disturbing. There will always be attempts from foreign nations &amp; adversaries to steal Americans' personal information and we need to view emerging technologies like #5G with a critical eye. https://t.co/UB8tdzeb34,2020-02-10 21:34:41,Twitter Web App,24,36

Last year inspired by Peg's courage I worked to secure an additional $3 million for colorectal cancer research. Peg has passed but her advocacy lives on.

Rosa Parks was born on this day in 1913. As we remember her legacy of strategic undaunted activism during the Civil Rights Movement I'm also inspired by her years of work as a public servant and advocate for women's rights. #BlackHistoryMonth https://t.co/bJPkYD6a9x,2020-02-04 18:14:41,Twitter Web App,28,83

2. In our efforts to stop endless wars and reassert Congressional authority it's important to remove outdated AUMFs from the law books &amp; ensure they are not used to justify future military action that was not originally authorized by Congress.,2020-02-03 20:27:28,Twitter Web App,2,13
– and I firmly believe that members of Congress should have to responsibly debate and put their vote on the record before making the most serious decision that is in our power to make.,2020-02-03 20:27:28,Twitter Web App,4,13
So why repeal it?   The significance of repealing the 2002 #AUMF is two-fold.  1. The Constitution requires Congress to vote before sending Americans into conflict –,2020-02-03 20:27:28,Twitter Web App,2,16
1. The 2002 #AUMF was drafted 18 years ago to authorize action against Saddam Hussein’s Iraq. Much has changed including the fall of his regime and this AUMF is no longer required.  2. Repeal wouldn't impact our ongoing counterterrorism efforts which fall under the 2001 AUMF.,2020-02-03 20:27:28,Twitter Web App,2,10
Last week I joined both House Republicans and Democrats in voting to repeal the 2002 #AUMF. There's been a lot of discussion around the AUMF so here are a few more details (thread.) https://t.co/jxgR8d6hiF,2020-02-03 20:27:27,Twitter Web App,5,15
