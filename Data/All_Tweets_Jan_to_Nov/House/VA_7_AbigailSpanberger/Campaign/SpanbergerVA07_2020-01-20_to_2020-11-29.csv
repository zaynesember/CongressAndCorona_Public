Yesterday early voting began in Virginia and the energy was exciting. @vpapupdates is reporting that across Virginia more than 27000 Virginians voted yesterday. Our democracy is strongest when all of our voices are heard &amp; we do that with our vote! Do you have a plan to vote? https://t.co/QDvpu9hp5c,2020-09-19 21:36:47,Twitter for iPhone,22,100
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg blazed a path for so many of us who are in public service and she will be an example to generations of women including my three young daughters. I’m grateful for her service her commitment to the law and the example that she set. https://t.co/eVaDJG7Ccc,2020-09-19 19:00:49,TweetDeck,14,79
For those despairing over Justice Ginsburg’s loss &amp; those considering all that her death means for our country &amp; highest court I am choosing to carry the belief in our country &amp; the hope of these students with me every day until Election Day and thereafter. I hope you will too.,2020-09-19 18:05:26,Twitter Web App,8,50
And yet in the immediacy of that loss I was struck by the community the students had brought together the cause of justice they believe in and value they place on our most basic civic responsibility – the vote.,2020-09-19 18:05:25,Twitter Web App,4,24
As they honored his life we learned of the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. The world had just lost a woman who blazed a trail for gender equality and used her brilliance and her love of the law to seek justice for all people.,2020-09-19 18:05:25,Twitter Web App,1,8
As the teens honored him they spoke of the hope they have for our country the belief they have in our shared future and they implored us – the adults with a vote and a voice – to use it.,2020-09-19 18:05:24,Twitter Web App,1,8
Last night I attended an event organized by teenagers most of whom cannot yet vote to honor the life of Congressman John Lewis. In Veteran’s Park in Orange County they spoke of his legacy his fight for voting rights &amp; the impact he even as a teenager was able to have. https://t.co/wjHFdukDs5,2020-09-19 18:05:24,Twitter Web App,16,176
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg lived an extraordinary life consistently demonstrating a fierce tenacity a commitment to justice and a brilliance that paved the way for generations of Americans in the field of law and in the pursuit of equality.

September is National Recovery Month and I am reflecting on the stories that HARP participants shared with me when I visited their program in Chesterfield. Their stories were profound and have fueled my legislative work on Capitol Hill. https://t.co/uOPEr8vHID,2020-09-17 16:41:28,TweetDeck,4,19

Del. Freitas is lying about his own extreme record of voting against the health of families in #VA07. In Congress I’ve fought to protect those with pre-existing conditions &amp; to lower prescription drug costs. I’ve delivered on my promises: https://t.co/hn8u2nlb8w,2020-09-15 22:38:11,Twitter Web App,8,53
Del. Freitas: -Was 1 of only 4 Republicans to vote no on capping insulin prices -Was the only person in the Virginia House to vote no to require that small-group market insurance companies cover autism diagnosis and treatment -Voted no on Medicaid expansion in Virginia,2020-09-15 22:38:10,Twitter Web App,25,75
In Sunday’s Washington Post readers were reminded of Del. Freitas’ terrible record on healthcare coverage for Central Virginian children and families: https://t.co/9KsgYMfKIK,2020-09-15 22:38:10,Twitter Web App,6,39
Del. Freitas even called the ACA “a cancer."  Yes that’s right he called the law that finally gave protections to people with pre-existing conditions like asthma diabetes and cancer – “a cancer.”,2020-09-15 22:38:10,Twitter Web App,10,46
This month @myVPM confirmed what Virginians already knew was true: Del. Freitas has repeatedly called for abolishing the ACA without a replacement which would end the requirement that health insurance policies cover pre-existing conditions. https://t.co/jH6mkceIBY,2020-09-15 22:38:10,Twitter Web App,17,42
Protecting pre-existing conditions is not a campaign strategy it’s a policy choice &amp; one that Del. Freitas has failed to make time &amp; time again. While he’s changing his campaign strategy to claim support for pre-existing conditions protections he can’t change his voting record. https://t.co/gzIiu4c1p0,2020-09-15 22:38:09,Twitter Web App,91,298

I decided to run in 2017 because Members of Congress tried to eliminate these protections with their repeated votes to repeal the ACA. As efforts to undo our healthcare system continue I’ll keep working to protect and strengthen our healthcare system. 6/6,2020-06-26 14:07:23,Twitter Web App,9,29
During a pandemic this is what the administration chooses to do. This is a reckless assault on our healthcare system as we see spikes in COVID-19 cases around the country and Americans continue to die. 5/6,2020-06-26 14:07:22,Twitter Web App,4,22
If the Trump Administration is successful in court Americans will lose (cont.): - Essential benefits’ services without copays (colonoscopies mammograms wellness visits gestational diabetes screening etc.) - The ability to stay on their parents’ insurance until 26. 4/6,2020-06-26 14:07:22,Twitter Web App,3,5
If the Trump Administration is successful in court Americans will lose: - Protections for people with pre-existing conditions - Protections from being dropped by insurance if they get sick - Caps on lifetime or annual benefits - Caps on premiums charged to older Americans 3/6,2020-06-26 14:07:22,Twitter Web App,3,2
Yes this means that people - many of them small business owners - who rely on ACA marketplace plans for their health insurance would lose their coverage.  It also means that Americans regardless of insurer would lose the key provisions of the ACA that protect all Americans. 2/6,2020-06-26 14:07:22,Twitter Web App,3,4

A military officer A combat veteran A Purple Heart recipient testified before Congress pursuant to a Congressional subpoena but against the wishes of the president.   Today he was escorted out of the White House.   This type of retaliation is as dangerous as it is unprecedented. https://t.co/dIb1PKqC9F,2020-02-07 21:56:24,Twitter for iPhone,244,806

This is the beauty of our country. That a child of refugees indeed refugees themselves can be elected by their countrymen to Congress.   Summarily banning people from our country doesn’t make us safer. It betrays who we are and the promise of America. https://t.co/YbyXt5Lhdl,2020-02-01 01:25:21,Twitter for iPhone,52,281

When a Republican SuperPAC FOIAed me in 2018 it took three weeks for them to get my entire unredacted national security questionnaire SF-86. It shouldn’t take three years to get the details of one meeting. https://t.co/MwhgXcGFIw,2020-01-31 16:26:41,Twitter for iPhone,660,1814

Today I'll be voting to reassert Congressional authority in decisions of war. It's long overdue.

My work is for the people of Central Virginia not special interests or mega-donors.

In 2019 I was proud to be able to hear directly from my neighbors about their trade concerns &amp; voice them directly to the administration.  Last month I was proud to pass the USMCA.  And today I'm proud to see the United States ratify the agreement. (4/4),2020-01-29 18:52:00,Twitter for iPhone,1,16
The process leading up to today's signing ceremony marked a new benchmark for successful trade negotiations. Rather than retreat to their respective corners like they often do American lawmakers actually came together worked across party lines and reached a deal. (3/4),2020-01-29 18:51:59,Twitter for iPhone,1,12
Their views aren't based on political games in Washington or how they think the USMCA could affect the partisan horse-race—they're based on the true economic benefits of the USMCA: stability for American businesses &amp; a level playing field for the American worker. (2/4),2020-01-29 18:51:59,Twitter for iPhone,1,5
Why today is a big deal:  In our district the economy isn't a partisan issue. Whether in conversations with small businesses or in roundtable discussions with family farms I've repeatedly heard about the need for trade stability with Canada and Mexico through the #USMCA.

Soaring drug costs are hurting families &amp; seniors in Central Virginia and across the country.  They don’t deserve to be gouged every time they go to the pharmacy.
