Add to that: push mail-in and early voting to make it easier to manipulate the vote; discourage in-person Election Day voting; institute “election season” versus “Election Day” https://t.co/64JzoaO5py,2020-11-05 12:21:00,Twitter for iPhone,1,11
New Presidential campaign strategy: stay in your basement at home; don’t answer the difficult questions; let the media manipulate the minds of Americans; let your operatives in blue states steal the vote tally https://t.co/mqYLjUg3xE,2020-11-05 12:19:30,Twitter for iPhone,2,9
I stand with Donald J Trump as he battles these elements that try to steal an election: 100% reporting in NC DJT leads still not called.  Same in GA. But AZ called with 51% on election night? https://t.co/t1rhtvaUVj,2020-11-05 12:18:15,Twitter for iPhone,24,41
It’s a sad day when the threats to our election processes come not from outside forces like Russia Iran m NoKo or radical Islamic Terrorists but from political operatives within manipulating votes hindering transparency &amp; instilling fraud in our free election system.,2020-11-05 12:17:32,Twitter for iPhone,10,24
Fox News and the AP need to reverse their call on AZ for Biden. I’ve seen the data there is a clear path forward for Trump to win the state. Suggesting otherwise is a disservice to the voters of Arizona.,2020-11-04 22:32:19,Twitter for iPhone,4,4

Throughout this campaign Biden has refused to answer the tough questions and refused to answer voters. When he has the chance to speak to voters he prefers to count the minutes until he can go back to his basement.

In 47 years in public service Biden has never made the progress in international diplomacy that we have seen from President Trump and his America First agenda. The progress towards peace in the Middle East is only one of countless reasons we need four more years!,2020-10-27 13:30:00,TweetDeck,1,0

.@realDonaldTrump's point that Biden wouldn't have blocked travel with China is absolutely true and one of the most important points of this COVID conversation. Joe cares more about political correctness than doing what needs to be done. That's disqualifying #Debate2020,2020-09-30 01:30:19,Twitter Web App,2,17
Biden refusing to state his position on court packing means he will ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT court packing if given the opportunity. Don't let Democrats pack the courts and destroy this country with judicial activism. #Debates2020,2020-09-30 01:26:39,Twitter Web App,5,20
