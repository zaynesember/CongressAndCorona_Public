Here's an idea. Since your company supports law enforcement how about showing it! Free tire rotations for all our police officers during National Police Week and have all of your employees wear "Goodyear stands with law enforcement" shirts. You in? https://t.co/boieHC3p2o,2020-08-19 23:45:26,Twitter Web App,137,333
If you're not anti-law enforcement then why won't you allow expressions of support for law enforcement from your employees? Why is a rainbow flag more important than a thin blue line? https://t.co/boieHC3p2o,2020-08-19 23:39:33,Twitter Web App,11,24
