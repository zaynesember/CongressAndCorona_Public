In #FL26 there are over 77K workers employed by small businesses.  That’s why I fought so hard to bring emergency aid to our Main Street shops &amp; restaurants.

The GOP Senate has to get to work to help those hurting in this crisis instead of appointing right wing conservative judges. They need to work for the people and bring the #HeroesAct to the floor.

#COVID19 cases in... Florida: 15698 Miami-Dade: 5461  FL is in the top 10 states for the deadly virus.

Trump this week: Proposes to cut billions from #SocialSecurity affecting 120000 seniors retirees &amp; disabled Americans in our South Florida district.

It's shameful and dangerous that all it took for AG Barr to undermine the rule of law was a tweet.   Barr owes the American people an explanation.
