And to South Florida and the Keys: it has been the honor of my life to serve you. I love this community from Key West to the Upper Keys to South Miami. I'll keep fighting to make sure no one messes with my people.  Please stay safe wear a mask &amp; enjoy the holidays. (8/8),2020-11-18 15:56:31,Twitter Web App,354,10262
Florida &amp; National Dems: Our brightest days are ahead. To get there we must step back and deeply analyze how we're talking to Latinos and every voter. As the first South American immigrant elected to Congress I stand with you as we do it. (7/8),2020-11-18 15:56:31,Twitter Web App,444,6571
There were many factors: a targeted disinformation campaign to Latinos; an electorate desperate to re-open wracked with fear over the economic consequences; a national party that thinks racial identity is how we vote.  It's not just about socialism. (6/8),2020-11-18 15:56:30,Twitter Web App,600,6671
Yes the fear of socialism is real and engrained for those of us who fled dangerous places in search of the American dream. My own father was murdered by a criminal with a gun in Ecuador.  But it's not why I lost and it's not the only reason South Florida went red. (5/8),2020-11-18 15:56:30,Twitter Web App,310,4455
I was a leader in advocating for Venezuelan freedom — and as an immigrant my story is the Miami story.  But it wasn't enough. Because South FL is extremely diverse. We are unique. And when others try to treat Latinos as a monolithic group they miss the nuances. (4/8),2020-11-18 15:56:29,Twitter Web App,324,5667
Despite this swing I was one of just a few Democrats nationally to outperform Biden. Here's why: 1. Focused on the economy 2. Knocked on 23k doors &amp; had convos w 133k ppl via phone &amp; text 3. Invested big in radio mail digital &amp; TV 4. And did it all in English AND Spanish (3/8),2020-11-18 15:56:29,Twitter Web App,337,5516
My district voted for Clinton +16% and Trump +6% — that's a DRAMATIC 22 pt swing at the top of the ticket not easily explained by this false narrative of progressives versus moderates.  I won by 2% in 2018 and lost by 3% in 2020. (2/8),2020-11-18 15:56:29,Twitter Web App,276,4465
Many have commented on Democratic losses in South Florida and with Latinos across the country.  As the Congresswoman from #FL26 who lost her seat and the first South American immigrant ever elected to Congress...  Let me set the record straight. (1/8),2020-11-18 15:56:29,Twitter Web App,3277,18747

The facility was right next to a Superfund site contaminated with arsenic and lead. No residential housing is allowed to be built there.   It was so close to an Air Force base that @HUDgov has called the area " unacceptable" for people to live in.,2020-10-23 14:49:50,Twitter Web App,6,13

#FamilySeparation came up at last night's debate so I want to share my own experience with the issue.

Let's be clear: Gimenez's words mean nothing when he still supports the GOP lawsuit to have the entire ACA thrown out as unconstitutional. He can't lie his way to Washington. #FL26,2020-10-14 23:34:23,Twitter Web App,8,35
In office Gimenez cut funding for services that would have helped Miami-Dade residents get coverage through the ACA.  As a candidate he's done nothing but praise Trump and his attacks on affordable care.  https://t.co/dMq2ae31Lv,2020-10-14 23:34:23,Twitter Web App,13,38
