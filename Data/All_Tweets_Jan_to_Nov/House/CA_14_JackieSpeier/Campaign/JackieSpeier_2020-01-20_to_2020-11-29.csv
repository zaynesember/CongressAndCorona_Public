Under Trump security assistance to Azerbaijan increased by $100 million. We need a president who stands up to Erdogan ends military aid to Azerbaijan and embodies true leadership abroad and at home. That leader is Joe Biden! https://t.co/u7PON3o76j,2020-10-30 01:10:02,Twitter for iPhone,8,15

The world that Justice Ginsburg imagined is under threat with access to healthcare reproductive justice voting rights civil rights &amp; more at grave risk.

We will not allow a serial sexual predator who lost the popular vote replace the legend who wrote women’s equality into the law 45 days before an election. We will rise up. We will fight like our lives depend on it.,2020-09-20 00:36:20,Twitter for iPhone,416,1146
#OTD 26 years ago #VAWA authored by @JoeBiden was signed into law giving sexual assault &amp; domestic violence survivors a voice &amp; the care they need. What possible reason could Mitch McConnell have to block its reauthorization?! The House passed it in 2019. Enough already! https://t.co/4E8YDAVJRJ,2020-09-14 00:26:43,Twitter for iPhone,31,49
.@POTUS’ call for his supporters to Fight for President Trump &amp; to be an Army for Trump at the polls is less a dog whistle for voter intimidation more like a siren song for the MAGA crowd to use violence to silence voters who disagree. These vile &amp; desperate tactics won’t work!,2020-09-09 17:59:01,Twitter for iPhone,6,10
As we celebrate this #LaborDay &amp; honor the gains we’ve made due to the labor movement &amp; look ahead to ending the gender pay gap &amp; est a $15 minimum wage let’s not forget the best way to address economic &amp; social injustice is at the ballot box this November! #BidenHarris2020 https://t.co/SzDx4ODTAD,2020-09-07 18:29:11,Twitter for iPhone,9,26
On a daily basis Trump shows us in new ways the truth we’ve known all along he’s morally bankrupt and unfit to serve. In November we need to show him that we can organize and vote him out.  https://t.co/YHQ3L90Zwd,2020-09-04 13:31:30,Twitter for iPhone,3,13
It’s hardly surprising to see a country starved for leadership intelligence strength of character &amp; courage of conviction vastly preferred the commanding presence of Kamala Harris over Pence’s weak speech. But it’s still has to be eating @POTUS alive! https://t.co/JPwcI2FMzk,2020-08-27 22:42:44,Twitter Web App,6,15
In case you missed it I had a great conversation with actor and director @HelenHunt -- a true feminist and champion for the disenfranchised and most vulnerable members of our communities and country.

Biden was vibrant hard-charging eloquent &amp; made us feel something last night we've missed for the last 3 1/2 years - HOPE. If you have any doubt of the power of his speech check out the MAGA crowd crying about Joe reading from a teleprompter. If Trump can't read no one can! https://t.co/fjadyJoQMl,2020-08-21 22:22:02,Twitter for iPhone,9,25
The passion we saw from Joe Biden last night about protecting our troops &amp; NOT being complicit w/Russian bounties being placed on their heads comes from spending his life in service of our country &amp; being a proud military father - two things Trump has never done nor understands.,2020-08-21 21:40:22,Twitter for iPhone,15,39
#JoeBiden showed America he has a plan for the pandemic economy environment &amp; social injustice &amp; it includes ALL of us. He'll work as hard for those who don't support him as those who do. He's fighting for us all to "overcome this season of darkness." What a refreshing change.,2020-08-21 14:53:45,Twitter for iPhone,4,14
Just thinking of all the girls and young women seeing Kamala Harris a fiercely proud Black and South Asian woman nominated to the 2020 Presidential ticket and knowing that their time is here and they will be our next trailblazing leaders! https://t.co/WM7DkvT6lk,2020-08-20 19:59:36,Twitter for iPhone,2,14
As a former teacher &amp; a mom Jill Biden knows the anguish parents are suffering amid the pandemic. Her compassion &amp; understanding is what we need after the last 4 years. She's right: Joe Biden will carry us forward in our time of need &amp; keep the promise of America for all of us. https://t.co/8vKstLa7dq,2020-08-19 20:06:25,Twitter for iPhone,1,8
First Lady Michelle Obama is right we must close out the noise and the fear and open our hearts to what is right for our country and future generations. We must do this for our children who are seeing our nation fail not just on matters of policy but on matters of character! https://t.co/2lTuw6GCSP,2020-08-18 14:25:01,Twitter for iPhone,5,21
&amp; laugh that assures you that she’s real &amp; human. She exudes the confidence we need in leaders today &amp; the kindness to shelter those in need. She will bring great excitement &amp; enthusiasm to the ticket. I’m thrilled VP Biden selected her among a list of truly remarkable women.,2020-08-12 00:08:45,Twitter for iPhone,7,34
I have known Kamala for close to 20 years. She is an incredible talent great communicator has a sharp legal mind &amp; the coolness to disarm enemies &amp; at the same time protect those entrusted to her care. She is a consummate leader w/a warmth that draws people in ...,2020-08-12 00:06:54,Twitter for iPhone,34,148
Joe Biden’s Agenda for Women recognizes &amp; celebrates women for their humanity &amp; equal worth. It answers the call for transformative change that women have demanded ushering us into the future. The Democratic Women's Caucus leadership is proud to endorse &amp; stands ready to assist. https://t.co/XeziOJibP9 https://t.co/Y8rweZTtGv,2020-07-28 01:30:42,Twitter for iPhone,7,14
It's undeniable. We need to do more to prevent sexual assault in our military and I'm glad to see Democratic presidential candidates taking this seriously. No matter who is the eventual nominee know that I will hold them to this commitment. https://t.co/bTyiJNmLQY,2020-01-30 03:07:00,Sprout Social,8,40
.@alexismcgill is right. We all need to be ready for the upcoming @GOP attacks on our reproductive rights. After almost 50 years with Roe as law of the land we cannot let them take us back. @PPact https://t.co/1amRxgfxy4,2020-01-30 01:34:00,Sprout Social,14,25
For as long as @realDonaldTrump is in the White House no one's reproductive rights are safe -- not even in our progressive home of CA. This is a threat to our health and reproductive care but Californians won't be bullied.  https://t.co/KcMmgo2HkZ,2020-01-30 00:19:01,Sprout Social,6,17
Thank you @eqca! I'm proud to have your support and to fight by your side for #LGBTQ rights in California and across the country. https://t.co/QtskQ7vrZS,2020-01-28 23:37:14,Twitter Web App,4,15
There's can be no question: Bolton must testify. We know it and so does the @GOP. The only real question now is whether Republican Senators will continue to choose @realDonaldTrump over their country their constituents and the truth. https://t.co/DjRCAhDEua,2020-01-28 22:35:01,Sprout Social,10,41
Public opinion is turning.   @realDonaldTrump's crimes are becoming harder &amp; harder to deny or hide.  And Mitch McConnell knows there's no winning if he plays fair so he's rewriting the rules instead. #MidnightMitch https://t.co/ybPorcaCCL,2020-01-23 00:23:00,Sprout Social,11,34
After decades Virginia passed the ERA. Now we need to pass my bill that will remove the deadline from the resolution and finally put women in the constitution. https://t.co/VB0xntRFgw,2020-01-22 21:24:01,Sprout Social,2,14
I told my own abortion story on the House floor almost 10 years ago but in 2020 there's still a stigma attached to this common procedure. These stories are #OursToTell -- and when we do tell them -- they're powerful. https://t.co/QeHWMhv0sd,2020-01-22 20:03:04,Twitter Web App,9,26
Someone show this to #MidnightMitch: https://t.co/z0kUx88vqL,2020-01-22 18:01:07,Twitter Web App,5,14
There were 3 witnesses in Bill Clinton's Senate impeachment trial. 41 in Andrew Johnson's. What's happening with @realDonaldTrump's is not normal and it isn't right. https://t.co/l8C5fXhZOh,2020-01-22 00:21:00,Sprout Social,26,54

Anti-woman anti-choice groups are pouring millions into @realDonaldTrump's campaign. This administration has made their agenda clear since they entered the White House -- they're doing everything they can to strip away our rights. Don't let them. https://t.co/owJJTtRrtx,2020-01-21 00:18:00,Sprout Social,19,24
First @realDonaldTrump says he didn't do it. Then he admitted that he did it but says it isn't actually a crime. And now this comes out: https://t.co/dDM9WxgUh1,2020-01-20 22:58:01,Sprout Social,5,14

Martin Luther King Jr. fought against racism and bigotry and he undeniably made our world a better place. But his work is far from done and today it is as important as ever that we continue his legacy by standing up and fighting against all hate.,2020-01-20 18:49:01,Sprout Social,5,17
