Originalism is not some time-honored judicial philosophy. It was coined by failed Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork to justify attacks on Roe.

Today is the 3rd anniversary of Trump's #GlobalGagRule forcing health care providers abroad to choose between providing comprehensive care &amp; keeping their funding. This Administration's assault on women's health care &amp; bodies literally has no bounds! The result is devastating⬇️,2020-01-23 17:32:40,Twitter Web App,54,127

Thugs and organized crime cartels say things like “they are going to go through some things.” It’s not normal for the President of the United States to say something like that. Amb Yovanovitch deserves our undying respect for enduring threats from an ungrateful President.,2020-01-23 10:57:21,Twitter for iPhone,340,1433
If @POTUS can defy congressional subpoenas we should shut the doors of the Capitol and return our salaries to the Treasury because Congress would be impotent and we would have a full blown autocrat in power who can do ANYTHING with impunity.

Those who’ve waged war on abortion rights have seen our power as we took to the streets for the Women’s March and we marched to the ballot box in 2018. Get ready for 2020 because we will not go back!,2020-01-22 16:58:45,Twitter Web App,35,125
On the 47th anniversary of #RoevWade the fight for abortion rights is as critical as ever. SCOTUS will hear a case on Louisiana's draconian admitting privileges that would leave only 1 clinic &amp; 1 doctor to provide all abortions.

Sekulow just told bald-faced lies to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. Republicans WERE allowed in the SCIF. I was there. Many Rs CHOSE not to show up.,2020-01-21 20:32:06,Twitter Web App,12133,38848

This #MLKDay2020 let us look to Dr. King’s example as a beacon of light who inspires us to be our best despite those seeking to divide us. As Dr. King wisely intoned “Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.” https://t.co/m8eaSdA5k9,2020-01-20 14:57:32,Twitter for iPhone,57,224
