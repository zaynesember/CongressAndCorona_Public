I strongly oppose this legislation. We must keep Americans safe. #AUMF @realDonaldTrump,2020-01-30 20:17:51,Twitter Web App,44,116

So does this mean @SenSchumer agrees with House Republicans that the way @RepAdamSchiff lead his investigations were anything but transparent and “fair”?   So what was Rep. Schiff hiding in the SCIF? #ImpeachmentHoax https://t.co/swmmN9EiYX,2020-01-28 20:29:33,Twitter for iPhone,7,22
Last Friday marked the 47th annual #MarchForLife and for the first time in history the march was attended by a sitting President.

Impressive opening arguments made by the President's defense team this morning.   In just two hours the White House counsel shredded the case that took 24 hours for house managers to present.   I look forward to the President being exonerated! #TrumpDefense,2020-01-25 17:31:13,Twitter for iPhone,852,3289
