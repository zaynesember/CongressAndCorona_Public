It often happens that rural places don’t see the same improvements as our big cities. I believe people should be able to get the same standard of health care whether they live in Albuquerque or Silver City. #nm02 #nmpol  https://t.co/tnL2SMUFss,2020-02-15 18:42:00,TweetDeck,23,49
So glad to visit with democrats in Valencia county last weekend. I’m forever grateful for the incredible turnout efforts of volunteers in Valencia in 2018 and excited to work with this amazing group of people again this year. #nm02 #nmpol https://t.co/U5X16XNtd5,2020-02-13 18:21:03,TweetDeck,12,27
Humbled by the kind words of @FP4America. "Very few Members of Congress match her level of dedication in terms of ensuring that the interests and the values of her constituents are front and center in Capitol Hill debates."  https://t.co/YBihFJYiFw,2020-02-06 23:15:58,TweetDeck,19,25

10 years ago today the #CitizensUnited decision gave special interests unprecedented influence in our political system. Elections should be decided by the people which is why I've refused to accept corporate PAC money &amp; am committed to getting dark money out of politics. https://t.co/hFLFqGgtR6,2020-01-21 22:39:51,TweetDeck,12,34
