That's not to say R&amp;D isn't worthwhile.  But there are way too many market distortions in our energy sector and way too many under-deployed but economic clean technologies.  Remove regulatory barriers first.,2020-11-25 23:01:49,Twitter Web App,3,32

@jburwen @JigarShahDC @JesseJenkins @jsgates84 @MiriamWasser @JayInslee You all are far too kind.  But one of my long-standing laments is that energy policy isn't done in any single place.

@SymetraTourCBO We just shouldn't assume those market inefficiencies don't exist and should be ever-vigilant to ensure that the reasons the distortions were first put in place are still necessary lobbyists-insistence to that point notwithstanding.,2020-11-21 19:02:30,Twitter Web App,0,0

@SymetraTourCBO Well... subject to appropriately pricing externalities and without making any call for unilateral disarmament maybe.  My point is simply that we should never talk about a sector with as many distortions as the energy sector in pure-market principles.,2020-11-21 18:58:47,Twitter Web App,0,1
15/ And as you succeed... as you remove those market distortions so that your inherently economically-superior products can thrive... don't lose sight of how you got there.  Competition is hard.  I get it.  It is our collective obligation to fight for it. /fin,2020-11-21 14:01:54,Twitter Web App,5,29
14/ Meanwhile to my friends in the clean energy industry a request: get organized.  Push for barrier / subsidy removal as hard or harder than you push for more incentives.  Otherwise we're just putting ever bigger engines in a car that still has the emergency brake on.,2020-11-21 13:59:46,Twitter Web App,8,49

12/ (As an aside on that last one when China directs their banks to invest in low-return belt &amp; road initiatives we rightly bash it as anti-market.  This is no different and folks at the @USOCC deserve the same criticism.),2020-11-21 13:56:21,Twitter Web App,4,28

10/ And why when the COVID-driven downturn came last spring one of the first things the Trump administration did was inject tax payer $ to try and prop up the oil industry.  https://t.co/Tw0z1Exe1f,2020-11-21 13:52:30,Twitter Web App,4,20

8/ But as Smith understood the opportunity that exists to create more market-friendly conditions is precisely what makes it so hard.  We pay lip service to competitive markets but the incentives of "civil government" as constituted in the US don't push that way.,2020-11-21 13:49:00,Twitter Web App,4,25

5/ And furthermore even those who would benefit from the removal of those distortions rarely make that ask; they ask for incentives to counter the headwind rather than ask us to get rid of the conditions WE CREATED that made their progress so hard.,2020-11-21 13:43:34,Twitter Web App,3,22
4/ This holds us back but is also an enormous opportunity.  The incentives that created all those anti-market policies also mean that we have enormous opportunities to make our markets more efficient by removing existing regulated distortions.,2020-11-21 13:41:40,Twitter Web App,2,28
3/ But no one comes to DC and says "Hey can you make the world safer for my competitors?"  Which is fine... but for the fact that policies that are expressly designed to be pro-business are often pitched in pro-market language.  Those terms are not always (rarely?) synonymous.,2020-11-21 13:40:16,Twitter Web App,3,43

Postscript: here's a write up of the bill from E&amp;E this morning: https://t.co/yYbVp4mqLg,2020-10-14 22:24:23,Twitter Web App,5,15
21/ Realistically this isn't going to pass before the end of this Congress.  But here's to 2021 being the year where we finally get serious about climate change and to using this approach to profitably reduce GHG emissions when we do.    Onward to the 117th.  /fin,2020-10-14 22:23:02,Twitter Web App,0,18
20/ And I would point out that cutting GHG emissions cheaply leaves more $ in our pocket for all those other good and necessary things.  As we said in our Climate Crisis report carbon pricing is necessary but not sufficient - we still need lots of other complementary policies.,2020-10-14 22:20:46,Twitter Web App,0,8
19/ Now to be fair it doesn't provide government revenue for deficit reduction / tax rebates / just transitions / other pet projects.  But that's because it prioritizes lowering CO2 as quickly and as cheaply as possible.,2020-10-14 22:19:52,Twitter Web App,0,3
18/ Bottom line is we end up with the sticks of a carbon tax the carrots of a clean energy standard and the market discipline of cap &amp; trade.  (I meant it when I said this is the best GHG pricing ever!),2020-10-14 22:18:38,Twitter Web App,0,5
17/ I've framed all this based on power but we do the same thing for thermal sources (boilers furnaces etc.) and tie them together so that power plants that recover otherwise-wasted energy via #CombinedHeatAndPower technology get an added incentive,2020-10-14 22:16:54,Twitter Web App,0,3
16/ Specifically any dirty generator who enters into a contract with a NEW clean generator that is at least 10 years long gets to lock in at the current allowance.  This gives an incentive for both parties to enter into contracts that make it easier to finance clean projects.,2020-10-14 22:15:14,Twitter Web App,1,4
15/ Next wrinkle: ideally we really want people to build new clean generators.  But since the pollution allowance is declining over time so too is the value of a unit of clean generation.  We fix that by giving an option for long-term contracts.,2020-10-14 22:13:50,Twitter Web App,1,5
14/ ...since the transaction is tied to MWh of generation the wealth transfer occurs between generators and nets to zero for consumers.  The price of pollution is monetized but consumer rates don't increase.,2020-10-14 22:12:14,Twitter Web App,0,3
13/ It also ensures that GHG markets work like electricity markets (or any other market for that matter).  The price a buyer pays for a ton of pollution is the same revenue a seller receives to reduce a ton.  AND...,2020-10-14 22:11:17,Twitter Web App,0,3
12/ But note - and this is key - generators that REDUCE emissions are paid by generators that INCREASE emissions.  There is no government intermediary.  This makes it revenue neutral and prevents any expanding federal bureaucracy.,2020-10-14 22:10:29,Twitter Web App,0,6
11/ Today's electric grid emits a little over 900 lbs of CO2/MWh.  So in a year where the new level is mandated to be 800 a coal plant at 2000 is allowed to enter 1200 but must buy 800.  A solar plant at 0 has 800 to sell.  And every combination in between for other techs,2020-10-14 22:09:12,Twitter Web App,0,3
10/ What we've done here is to set a declining schedule whereby the electric and thermal sectors decline to zero emissions per MWh (or per MMBtu) by 2040 and then give every generator an allowance based on the point in a given year.,2020-10-14 22:07:58,Twitter Web App,0,2
9/ By reformulating on an output basis we incentivize efficiency and ensure that what matters to consumers - the price of energy - is factored into the regulation.,2020-10-14 22:06:44,Twitter Web App,0,3
8/ But algebraically you can reformulate the same level of absolute annual emissions on an output basis - parts per MWh of electricity for example.,2020-10-14 22:06:01,Twitter Web App,0,5
7/ The crux of the idea is to move to an output based regulatory model.  Most environmental regs are "input based" - if you can only emit X parts per million your emission scales with fuel combustion (your input),2020-10-14 22:05:18,Twitter Web App,0,4

4/ It combines the best elements of cap &amp; trade carbon tax and clean energy standards while leaving out their flaws (overallocation of permits in C&amp;T all stick no carrot CT all carrot no stick CES),2020-10-14 22:03:11,Twitter Web App,1,4
3/ The basic idea is a market-based revenue-neutral GHG regulation that will get the electric and transportation sectors to zero CO2 by 2040 WITHOUT raising the price of energy to consumers.,2020-10-14 22:02:14,Twitter Web App,3,5

14/ Why are they doing this?  It was amoral to promote disinformation in order to sell more cigarettes and fossil fuel but there was at least a crass short-term economic interest.  The GBD advocates nothing more than killing Americans.  That is pure unadulterated evil.,2020-10-11 15:34:49,Twitter Web App,9,73
13/ It should because it is exactly the framing that has been used for decades to inject a false debate into the cigarette debate and climate change.  And GBD is backed by the same people.  (Hint: rhymes with Foch Mothers) https://t.co/EZ2x26cPWU,2020-10-11 15:32:37,Twitter Web App,14,97
12/ But surely some troll is about to say... "not ALL public health experts".  Why here's some crank I just found who says it's great.  Does that argument sound familiar?,2020-10-11 15:30:22,Twitter Web App,5,68

10/ To my @GOP colleagues I get it.  Trump is an embarrassment.  You'll do anything you can to suggest his incompetent drooling all over the checkerboard of our public health is actually some masterful 5-dimensional chess strategy.  It isn't.  And you don't have to emulate him.,2020-10-11 15:27:19,Twitter Web App,15,127

8/ Those regions were hit really hard.  But they did what they needed to do (masks testing social distancing) and flattened the curve.  That is the model we should have followed.  The surge we are now seeing in rural areas that didn't follow was a completely avoidable disaster.,2020-10-11 15:22:58,Twitter Web App,8,92
7/ When COVID first hit our shores it surged in densely populated cities... as airborne communicable diseases are inclined to do.  The fact that urban areas tend to have Democratic leadership is correlation not causation.,2020-10-11 15:21:34,Twitter Web App,12,117

4/ But the GBD is in many ways worse.  It advocates for the social isolation of our most vulnerable so that we can kill young people.  Seriously.  Exposing a greater % of people with lower % infection rates to COVID leads to more death.,2020-10-11 15:14:55,Twitter Web App,8,81

21/ Which is what I'm now trying to do in this new gig.  In the meantime if you've got any good ideas for policy nudges to close that gap shoot 'em our way!  /fin,2020-10-09 16:18:23,Twitter Web App,3,12
20/ But all that leaves really interesting policy opportunities: the fact that capital is NOT efficiently allocated in the industrial energy efficiency space means there are lots of economically accretive CO2-reduction projects that won't get made without a policy nudge.,2020-10-09 16:17:40,Twitter Web App,1,6
19/ ...because that paper mill manager is always going to be nervous to let an outsider control the energy plant that she depends on to make paper.,2020-10-09 16:16:09,Twitter Web App,0,3
18/ But entrepreneurship alone can't close that gap.  State electric regulations severely constrain the tools that a 3rd party can bring to bear on someone else's premises.  And the perceived risk issue never really goes away.,2020-10-09 16:15:07,Twitter Web App,0,1
17/ That is - in essence - the business model of the entire energy outsourcing industry.  But note that if the simple economist argument is right that industry shouldn't exist.  The 3 buckets explain why it does.,2020-10-09 16:13:03,Twitter Web App,0,1
16/ From an entrepreneurial perspective this is why I went from being a manufacturer to an owner/operator.  I figured that if businesses with access to 6% capital wouldn't make 40% return projects maybe I could raise 15% capital and split the upside.,2020-10-09 16:11:56,Twitter Web App,0,2
15/ When I asked to explain he said "I estimated the capital cost made the investment pitch and after I left the room they multiplied my capital estimate by 9/5 and added 32"... and that was why none of his efficiency projects ever got approved!,2020-10-09 16:09:59,Twitter Web App,0,3
14/ Funny story: a friend &amp; ex utility operations jock at one of the oil majors told me that their the accounting office dealt with this perceived risk by converting all capital costs from the utility department from "Celsius to Farenheit",2020-10-09 16:09:00,Twitter Web App,0,4
13/ That matters because an investment pitch from the plant manager to the CEO is always going to be internally perceived as less risky than a pitch from the utility manager to the same CEO.  Which means it demands a higher return.,2020-10-09 16:06:55,Twitter Web App,0,2
12/ If you're a plant manager in a paper company there is a path where you might someday be the CEO.  On the other hand if you're the utility manager in that same plant your internal career trajectory is probably capped at the head of Global utility operations.,2020-10-09 16:06:02,Twitter Web App,0,2
11/ Then finally IF there is any money left it goes to non-core capital.  And now you get into an interesting managerial problem:,2020-10-09 16:04:07,Twitter Web App,0,2
10/ This makes sense: if you're a paper manufacturer you want your team focusing on how to make higher quality paper at lower cost first before they start thinking about whether to put an organic rankine cycle on their boiler stack.,2020-10-09 16:02:46,Twitter Web App,0,3
9/ Then IF there is money left over capital is invested in discretionary projects.  But since every CEO had to read Michael Porter in B-school they prioritize discretionary projects in their core business and efficiency upgrades rarely sit in that bucket.,2020-10-09 16:01:06,Twitter Web App,0,4
8/ Then typically that capital is allocated into 3 buckets.  The first is mandatory compliance capital and often has zero or negative return.  Upgrades to meet new OSHA/EPA regs fixing leaky roofs etc - the sort of capital you always have to spend but never love to spend.,2020-10-09 16:00:01,Twitter Web App,1,3
7/ First in any given year corporate Treasurers &amp; CFOs set their annual capital budget.  In some years that number is zero.  If you need more $ than is in their budget it doesn't matter what the return is.  The project doesn't get built.,2020-10-09 15:57:56,Twitter Web App,0,5
6/ The answer is that industrials are coldly rational but not in the way that simple economics tells us.,2020-10-09 15:56:27,Twitter Web App,0,4
5/ Both of these things cannot be true.  Insulation is not a risky investment but there is no industrial that is consistently earning a 40% return on shareholder capital.  What gives?,2020-10-09 15:55:19,Twitter Web App,0,3
4/ But then if you go talk to economists (or politicians who vaguely remember their freshman econ class) you will be assured that markets are hyper-efficient and coldly rational at allocating capital so the mfrs must be lying (or else these are just really risky investments),2020-10-09 15:54:13,Twitter Web App,0,3
3/ Namely: "I can't sell anything unless I can show a simple payback of 2 years or less."  Since those assets typically have 15 - 20 year operating lives that implies industrials won't make those investments unless they provide compound annual returns on capital of 40%+,2020-10-09 15:52:40,Twitter Web App,0,6
2/ One of the disconnects you find in that industry is that at every trade show you meet people selling boiler economizers more efficient heat exchangers better insulation or any number of other efficiency technologies with the same sad story:,2020-10-09 15:51:41,Twitter Web App,0,2
1/ First as many of you know I spent 16 years before coming to Congress running companies that built owned and/or operated energy assets in the industrial sector.  I built 80 projects.  I failed to close an order of magnitude more.,2020-10-09 15:50:32,Twitter Web App,1,4

17/ Is it hard to do that now?  Of course it is.  We all want our kids back in school and our business re-open.  But that pain pales beside killing 12 million Americans.,2020-09-29 13:41:27,Twitter Web App,9,39
16/ They did that from the start and felt much less economic pain because it's way cheaper to control the spread of a virus before it spreads.  We should have and if Trump hadn't politicized science we would have too.,2020-09-29 13:40:20,Twitter Web App,9,44
15/ Namely: Test.  Contact Trace.  Wear a mask.  Social distance.  Provide quarantine housing for those who are infected.  We don't need to do any science to know whether that works - those countries have already proven it works.,2020-09-29 13:38:21,Twitter Web App,11,50
14/ And here's the thing: we don't have to do that.  We can simply follow the examples that New Zealand South Korea and so many other countries of done that has gotten the virus under control even without a vaccine.,2020-09-29 13:37:12,Twitter Web App,9,50
13/ 6% x 209 million = 12.5 million dead Americans.  That is the population of New York and Los Angeles combined.  That is the price you have to be willing to bear if you embrace herd immunity as a disease management strategy.   It.  Is.  Brutal.,2020-09-29 13:35:44,Twitter Web App,20,55
12/ We've learned a lot about ventilator management and treatment but there is simply no way that a 30x increase in COVID infection rates doesn't overload hospitals.  To assume death rates will be &lt;6% is naive at best evil at worst.,2020-09-29 13:33:52,Twitter Web App,10,48
11/ Today almost 3% of Americans who get infected are dying.  But remember back in March when we were talking about the need to flatten the curve and hospitals were getting overloaded?  The death rate then was &gt;6%.,2020-09-29 13:32:47,Twitter Web App,11,37
10/ If we are to get to the ~65% infection rate that seems to be required for herd immunity we will need to infect 65% x 332M or 216 million Americans.  Put another way that's 209 million Americans more than we have already.,2020-09-29 13:31:22,Twitter Web App,10,36
9/ To be sure there are more infections we don't know about.  And the excess deaths above average suggest that our death rate from COVID is also substantially undercounted.  But let's go with the data we have.  https://t.co/CSnXfebd6D,2020-09-29 13:28:56,Twitter Web App,10,33
8/ So now let's do some math.  As of this morning according to Johns Hopkins there are just over 7 million confirmed COVID cases in the United States or ~2.2% of the population.  Over 200000 Americans have died or 2.9% of those infected. https://t.co/b05R2FJ6Zv,2020-09-29 13:26:12,Twitter Web App,9,35
7/ This value is confirmed by a similar outbreak in Qatar where scientists concluded that "some communities" "have reached or nearly reached" herd immunity at infection rates of 65 - 70%.  https://t.co/pvUhg8Gj25,2020-09-29 13:23:31,Twitter Web App,8,28
6/ However we do have a few recent studies that should scare the pants off you.  After a surge in cases in Brazil scientists concluded that "...up to 70%..." of the population may need to be exposed to achieve herd immunity.  https://t.co/Z09dR3gYtD,2020-09-29 13:21:20,Twitter Web App,11,34
5/ To know that you have to know whether the virus will involve and how durable your immunity is once infected (assuming you are one of the lucky ones who doesn't die.)  As former CDC director Tom Frieden points out here we don't know those answers. https://t.co/TslnG83hFq,2020-09-29 13:17:59,Twitter Web App,10,34
4/ But let us suppose for a moment that you are completely amoral and you view economic growth as paramount no matter how many people die.  How many people would have to get infected in order to achieve herd immunity in that dystopian future?,2020-09-29 13:16:11,Twitter Web App,9,42
3/ This frankly isn't surprising.  If lots of your neighbors are getting sick and dying from a contagious disease you will be inclined to stay indoors avoid restaurants theaters and retail shops.  You cannot grow the economy in the midst of a raging public health crisis.,2020-09-29 13:14:02,Twitter Web App,13,69
2/ The idea that we can choose to kill people or grow our economy is also wrong.  Sweden famously has tried to pursue herd immunity and only managed to kill more Swedes and hurt their economy.  https://t.co/qgBxvyALgn https://t.co/ZrbrcJjXIs,2020-09-29 13:12:23,Twitter Web App,19,67

@Juror_No_144 Yes the EPA mpg rules don't treat electric as totally fuel free.

@joshuavcraft @loganemitchell Scales with mpg where EVs count as very high mpg cars (it's a complicated EPA formula).

@bramcla To be fair Homo Economicus is an imaginary creature.  If people only bought cars for economically rational reasons Ferrari wouldn't exist.  Or Lexus for that matter.

16/ (Sorry for the obscure song reference - couldn't resist.)  Point is decarbonizing transportation requires policies to lower vehicle cost.  Decarbonizing power and industrial sectors requires policies that price GHG emissions.  /fin,2020-09-25 13:08:05,Twitter Web App,1,20
15/ Such a vehicle of course doesn't exist (Damn you thermodynamics!) but I think we can stipulate it would cost more than $10000 more than Beck's current Hyundai.,2020-09-25 13:06:56,Twitter Web App,0,10
14/ If you are Homo Economicus rational and you are financing your car with a 7 year 5% loan you'd be willing to pay about $10000 more for that car (since at anything above that level your car payment increase &gt; your fuel savings),2020-09-25 13:05:03,Twitter Web App,1,9
13/ Another way to think of this for the financially inclined.  How much more would you pay for a car that had zero fuel cost?  e.g. in the example above how much would you pay to save $150/month?,2020-09-25 13:03:55,Twitter Web App,0,6
12/ To be clear we should - nay MUST - put a price on GHG emissions.  The point is just that decarbonizing the transportation sector will also require complementary policies that affect the price of the vehicle.  I'm a big fan of feebates personally: https://t.co/mGDw55sOSI,2020-09-25 13:01:11,Twitter Web App,2,14

10/ Any price that is set at a high enough level to change the economics of the heat &amp; power sectors &amp; decarbonize will be too low to decarbonize transpo.   And any price high enough for transpo will be way too high for H&amp;P.,2020-09-25 12:58:10,Twitter Web App,0,5
9/ Now let's bring that back to GHG pricing.   GHG pricing by definition is applied to the thing that emits greenhouse gases when burned - the fuel.,2020-09-25 12:56:13,Twitter Web App,0,6
8/ Which by the way is the same impact as a 25% change in fuel economy. The obvious implication being that in the (passenger) transpo sector the economics of vehicle ownership are dominate by vehicle cost. In the heat &amp; power sectors the economics are dominated by fuel cost.,2020-09-25 12:49:34,Twitter Web App,0,8
7/ I'll bet that's less than your monthly car + insurance payment.  And note that if the price of gasoline moves by $1 / gallon your differential cost is just $40/month.,2020-09-25 12:46:15,Twitter Web App,0,6
6/ To put this in more personal terms: in the example above if you average 35 mpg on your commute and get 27 mpg you're spending $155/month on $4/gallon gas.,2020-09-25 12:45:23,Twitter Web App,0,6
5/ Since your fuel use is a function of operating hours (e.g. you don't burn gasoline while your car is in the garage) that means that fuel cost is ~15x as important to the investment thesis in a power plant as it is in a vehicle all else equal.,2020-09-25 12:40:33,Twitter Web App,0,8
4/ In other words the same technology but in one case used for power generation and in the other for transportation.  In one mode you operate 6000 hours/yr and in the other you operate it 6000 hours over 15 years.,2020-09-25 12:39:12,Twitter Web App,0,6
3/ Now suppose you also buy a reciprocating engine that in the form of your commuter vehicle (e.g. an IC engine).  You have a 45 minute (each way) commute.  You keep it for 15 years.  That engine runs 45 minutes x 5 x 52 x 15 = 5850 hours over the course of it's entire life.,2020-09-25 12:38:05,Twitter Web App,0,4
2/ Suppose you buy a reciprocating engine to generate electricity.  You run it 5 days/week all year long or 5x24x52 = 6240 hours per year.  When you make that investment you plan on keeping it for 15 years before you have to replace it.,2020-09-25 12:35:26,Twitter Web App,0,4

@TanujDeora Wherein the axiom "everyone wants to be the third owner of a power plant".  You're right &amp; that history probably warrants a future thread.

@RL_Miller @drvox You're kind RL but let's not go full Highlander here.  There can be at least two.,2020-09-15 01:43:19,Twitter Web App,0,3
22/ I don't know the answer to that.  But I wish I did.  And hopefully some one will point me to some thoughtful person who's settled this once and for all.  Until then I leave you with Lloyd Dobler.  https://t.co/5zQ40Zk6bN /fin,2020-09-15 01:33:43,Twitter Web App,0,7
21/ Because that's the underlying premise of capacity markets (at least when stapled to full deregulation).  If there are examples what can we learn from them.  If not what do we learn from that?,2020-09-15 01:28:45,Twitter Web App,0,2
20/ Which leaves me with a bigger question: can you name ANY industry that was (a) capital-intensive and (b) sold a low-margin commodity product that made sufficient investments to meet demand subject only to pure free-market incentives?,2020-09-15 01:26:58,Twitter Web App,0,7
19/ I don't know which view is right.  But I do know that by the time we know for certain it will be too late to change course.  And that there are VERY different approaches to this question being taken by different parts of the US electric grid.,2020-09-15 01:24:29,Twitter Web App,0,7
18/ And - at best - they are functionally irrelevant because generation investors and consumers know they don't work and the real game is all in the energy market (and a host of other legacy market inefficiencies).  This latter view is basically the ERCOT model.,2020-09-15 01:22:33,Twitter Web App,0,5
17/ Which effectively means that - at worst - capacity markets are a gigantic experiment that will either yield gradual ramps in price and asset allocation or a sudden step function that leads to regional blackouts.,2020-09-15 01:21:08,Twitter Web App,0,2
16/ That's a beautiful theory.  But can you point to ANY market that factored in supply/demand balances 5 years in the future and got it right?  Especially for capital intensive low margin industries like electricity?  I can't think of any.,2020-09-15 01:19:40,Twitter Web App,0,4
15/ That means that for capacity markets to *work* they have to factor in all the construction starts handicap for load growth and a lot of other variables and then a bunch of independent actors need to factor that in to gradually ramp up the $/MW price.,2020-09-15 01:17:24,Twitter Web App,0,3
14/ By contrast if I want to run an existing plant *a little bit harder* tomorrow I know exactly what revenue I'll earn for each additional unit of output.,2020-09-15 01:15:48,Twitter Web App,0,2
13/ Here's the problem.  If I want to build a new power plant I have to design it finance it permit it build it and commission it.  At best that's a 2 year process.  More like 3 - 5.  But I have no idea what capacity prices are going to be that far in the future.,2020-09-15 01:14:49,Twitter Web App,0,2
12/ But - as our illustrious Speaker likes to remind us - "the plural of "anecdote" is not "data".  And I'm not sure my experience is globally true.,2020-09-15 01:11:25,Twitter Web App,0,10
11/ From personal experience I built a small cogen project in Vermont after ISO-NE created their Forward Capacity Market that never would have penciled with out it.  So anecdotally I know of an increase in capacity that only came about because of capacity markets.,2020-09-15 01:10:21,Twitter Web App,0,2
10/ Now to the tricky question: did capacity markets work?,2020-09-15 01:09:08,Twitter Web App,0,3
9/ But the key point is that you can't sell into energy markets unless you have a generator that is generating.  And you can't sell into capacity markets unless you have a generator that can be counted on to deliver some number of demonstrable MW when called.,2020-09-15 01:08:31,Twitter Web App,1,7
8/ To be clear you have to be able to meet that peak as well and markets have tests to ensure you can actually deliver that power on a moment's notice or else you can't get paid.,2020-09-15 01:06:45,Twitter Web App,0,7
7/ So as those markets were developed (excluding Texas) they set up spot prices for energy ($/MWh) and capacity ($/MW).  One pays you to generate the other one pays you for the peak you have the potential to generate.,2020-09-15 01:04:00,Twitter Web App,0,5
6/ That market which prices in $/MW (or per our prior analogy $/gallon-per-minute of available supply) pays you not for how much you generate but for how much you have available to generate at any given time.,2020-09-15 01:02:13,Twitter Web App,1,3
5/ But that wasn't enough.  Because you don't only want cheap energy.  You also want to know that when you turn on the lights there is some generator somewhere that can suddenly ramp up to meet that added load.  That's capacity.,2020-09-15 01:00:34,Twitter Web App,0,7
4/ That idea proved to be hugely successful and accurate.  The nuclear fleet went from 60% -&gt; 90% annual load factor.  We built 200 GW of high efficiency combined cycle gas turbines.  Power prices fell.  (And CO2/MWh fell because cheap energy = clean energy.),2020-09-15 00:59:23,Twitter Web App,0,7
3/ When power markets were deregulated in the 1990s there was an idea that if we set a real-time spot price for energy ($/MWh) driven by supply and demand we would incentivize lowest cost suppliers to produce more often driving down the price of energy for consumers.,2020-09-15 00:58:16,Twitter Web App,1,3
2/ For the uninitiated here's the basic issue: electricity markets (mostly) sell energy and capacity.  If you imagine an electric grid as a pipe full of water energy is the total gallons you buy.  Capacity is the maximum gallons/minute you can access.,2020-09-15 00:56:56,Twitter Web App,1,5
1/ First I should note that - unlike prior #nerdthreads - I'm not confident of my own intuition on this one.  So I'm posting as much to explain the issue as to see if any of you have great insights.,2020-09-15 00:55:17,Twitter Web App,0,8

12/ George W Bush for all his flaws understood that on 9/11.  He reminded us we were all Americans.  He reminded us this wasn't about a religion.    Most Americans and the best of our elected officials still do.,2020-09-11 14:12:52,Twitter Web App,4,33
11/ We can't afford to lose sight of that.  I'll leave psychologists to explain why an individual friend's death is more of a gut punch than the deaths of 3000 (or 192000) strangers.  But the tragedy is greater not smaller for the larger loss.,2020-09-11 14:11:33,Twitter Web App,1,26
10/ Each of the 192000+ we have lost is also a very specific person with friends neighbors and loved ones who had plans.  Who may or may not have been heroic in their final moments.  But who did nothing to deserve their fate.,2020-09-11 14:09:07,Twitter Web App,2,34
9/ Now to the current moment.  We've lost more Americans to COVID-19 this week than we lost on 9/11.,2020-09-11 14:07:53,Twitter Web App,4,40
8/ Even if you didn't know anyone who died on 9/11 the nature of the event made it personal.  This story from Esquire captures that vibe almost perfectly: https://t.co/EfkxZqsfqM,2020-09-11 14:04:45,Twitter Web App,2,18

6/ There is nothing heroic in my story but for the universality of it.  Our day was like everyone else's in the country - and the world.  We were panicked heartbroken confused saddened angry... and yet united by our common humanity.,2020-09-11 14:01:29,Twitter Web App,1,25
5/ I called my wife who was on her way to grad school and told her I had no idea what was going on but to get home.  We met and watched TV for the rest of the day.,2020-09-11 14:00:02,Twitter Web App,1,8
4/ Of course the news moved quickly and (by completely random coincidence) the power went out in our office.  Caused by a line worker in our office park but felt like the beginning of a national disaster.  We sent everyone home.,2020-09-11 13:59:12,Twitter Web App,0,7
3/ I was working in MA at the time and was in the process of training a new sale rep when we were interupted with news that "a small plane" hit one of the towers.  It seemed insignificant in the way that breaking news sometimes does.,2020-09-11 13:57:52,Twitter Web App,0,8
2/ A good family friend was on flight 93. He was among other things a pilot.  We'd like to believe he had some heroic role in those final moments given his training.,2020-09-11 13:56:34,Twitter Web App,0,13

@ricotorrea And once all the ice is melted things get really bad bc melting 1 lb of ice takes 100x as much energy as heating 1 lb of water by 1 degree.  The ice is buffering us from far worse acceleration to come if we don't act quickly.,2020-09-09 01:09:45,Twitter for Android,0,0
@ricotorrea You can't shed heat to space except through radiation which scales with temp per Boltzmans law.  So we do radiate to space but only as we heat up.  In the meantime we heat oceans air and melt ice.,2020-09-09 01:08:08,Twitter for Android,0,1
One postscript: I owe Charlie Bayless a huge debt for teaching me how to explain this stuff.  Much of this is a blatant plagarism of stuff he's told me through the years.  He's not on Twitter but worth reading everything he's ever written on energy &amp; climate.,2020-09-08 22:53:06,Twitter Web App,6,98
24/ The science is settled and has been for a century.  The opportunity is before us.  Give the deniers a tinfoil hat and a padded room if you must.   But more importantly let's get to work.  /fin,2020-09-08 22:49:07,Twitter Web App,7,75
23/ And if you don't burn fossil fuel you don't have to pay for it either.  The sun the wind the tides... those are all free.  Which means that we have a massive ECONOMIC opportunity to fix a massive climate problem.,2020-09-08 22:48:07,Twitter Web App,8,63
22/ But it's also a great opportunity.  Because the standard of living we all depend on doesn't depend on fossil fuel.  It depends on access to USEFUL energy.  Transportation.  Heating.  Cooling.  Light.  And we can make all those forms of energy without burning fossil fuel.,2020-09-08 22:46:45,Twitter Web App,6,56
21/ If you care about inter-generational equity this should scare you WAY more than deficits because the mess you are leaving our kids to clean up there is no way to inflate this problem away or find an understanding lender to write down.,2020-09-08 22:44:24,Twitter Web App,4,49
20/ If you care about national security this should scare you because climate destabilization (see: North Africa) destabilizes governments and creates refugee crises and large numbers of unemployed young men.  The stuff of which wars are made.,2020-09-08 22:42:43,Twitter Web App,5,57
19/ But that 1st law still holds.  We took chemical energy stored in the earth and converted it into heat energy.  The heat doesn't go away.  It melts ice.  Heats the air.  Heats oceans.  Fuels hurricanes.  It makes our entire planet a lot more volatile and dangerous.,2020-09-08 22:40:20,Twitter Web App,6,50
18/ And we keep emitting.  We are adding almost 3 million pounds of new CO2 into the atmosphere every SECOND.  That works out to the energy addition of 4 Hiroshima class nuclear weapons.  Every second.,2020-09-08 22:38:01,Twitter Web App,9,47
17/ So we KNOW that our species burned the carbon that made the CO2 that made the temperature go up.  And we know that Arrhenius - and Nelly - were right.  It's getting hot in here.,2020-09-08 22:36:02,Twitter Web App,4,50
16/ Also: carbon normally has a molecular weight of 12 but there is an isotope at 13.  Plants prefer C12 when they photosynthesize.  CO2 calculated in ancient ice cores shows a shift to more C12 post-industrial revolution - because we were burning old plants (aka fossil fuel),2020-09-08 22:33:52,Twitter Web App,2,39
15/ As an aside can you imagine asking an ethics review board to allow you to do an experiment where you test Arrhenius and Fourier's hypothesis by injecting massive CO2 into the atmosphere and seeing if it gets hotter?  That's essentially what we've done.,2020-09-08 22:29:52,Twitter Web App,4,48
14/ And Arrhenius and Fourier's math still holds up.  Put more CO2 in the atmosphere and the temperature goes up.  This is why we call it man-made global warming.,2020-09-08 22:28:12,Twitter Web App,7,48
13/ But by depending on fossil fuel combustion to provide that energy we took carbon that had been locked underground and barfed it into the atmosphere.  That is why the CO2 concentrations have spiked over the last 150 years.,2020-09-08 22:27:24,Twitter Web App,4,55
12/ William Drake tapped the first oil well in Titusville PA in 1859.  The access to all that concentrated energy has massively increased our standard of living.  (Amazing what you can do when you don't have to churn butter all day).,2020-09-08 22:26:17,Twitter Web App,3,42
11/ Remember prior to Watt inventing the steam engine in 1776 our species access to power was limited to our access to muscles.  But the steam engine gave us concentrated power first was we converted wood and peat to mechanical power and then from coal.,2020-09-08 22:24:36,Twitter Web App,3,38
10/ By 1908 CO2 was up to 299 ppm.  311 ppm by 1950.  By the time I was born in 1971 it was up to 326.  Today it's over 410 ppm.  That 100 year spike is totally ahistorical and totally due to our species.,2020-09-08 22:22:55,Twitter Web App,4,53
9/ Back in 1820 when Fourier first identified this math problem the atmospheric CO2 concentration was 284 ppm which was roughly where it had been for the prior 100000 years and that CO2 was the result of volcanoes and breathing animals.,2020-09-08 22:19:49,Twitter Web App,5,48
8/ This was in 1908 mind you.  5 years after the Wright Brothers flew at Kitty Hawk. 20 years before the TV was invented.  40 years before the transistor was invented.  For all practical purposes the science of climate change has been settled since that date.,2020-09-08 22:16:40,Twitter Web App,8,60
7/ Arrhenius then did the math and calculated that if the CO2 content in the atmosphere were 50% lower the earth would be 4C cooler.  And if were doubled the earth would be 4C warmer.,2020-09-08 22:14:26,Twitter Web App,3,46
6/ Weird because while those gases are invisible to light they absorb heat.  So when that light hits the earth and gets converted into heat (remember that 1st law) the heat bounces back and gets trapped by those gases.  Ergo the "greenhouse effect".,2020-09-08 22:12:13,Twitter Web App,4,52
5/ The answer it turned out was CO2.  In 1908 Svante Arrhenius figured out that CO2 (and water vapor and methane) acts like a blanket around the earth.  But it's a weird blanket.,2020-09-08 22:11:13,Twitter Web App,3,56
4/ The moon which is the same distance from the sun is that temperature.  But the earth was closer to 57F.   How come we are so much warmer than the moon?,2020-09-08 22:08:59,Twitter Web App,4,50
3/ So way back in 1820 Joseph Fourier armed with the 1st law had a math problem. He measured the energy coming from the sun to the earth (as light) and estimated how warm the earth should be when that light was converted to heat.  His math said the earth should be ~0F.,2020-09-08 22:06:11,Twitter Web App,6,50
2/ Energy can however be converted.  You can take electric energy put it through a resistor and make heat.  You can take chemical energy from gasoline and turn it into mechanical power in your car engine.  But the energy that comes out = the energy you put in.,2020-09-08 22:04:15,Twitter Web App,5,51
1/ First you gotta understand the 1st law of thermodynamics.  Energy can neither be created nor destroyed.  If you put 5 1 lb weights in a bag the bag will weigh 5 lbs.  If you put 500 1 Btu pieces of energy in a bag the bag will contain 500 Btus.,2020-09-08 22:03:28,Twitter Web App,6,65

25/ By contrast the LCOE tells you NOTHING of value to inform your initial investment NOTHING to inform whether or not you should run that plant once it's built and NOTHING about net social benefit.  But it is fun to do math.  /fin,2020-09-01 14:19:32,Twitter Web App,2,24
24/ That in turn means that there is no guarantee that you will earn your target return on capital.  And of course no guarantee that you can even articulate your target return on capital so who knows whether that's a bad thing.  :),2020-09-01 14:16:41,Twitter Web App,2,14
23/ So... What happens when you build a clean power plant that has no marginal fuel cost?  Your annual energy costs go down.  The environment improves.  Dirty power gets shut down.  Energy prices fall.  Which means (ironically) that the amount you save will decline over time.,2020-09-01 14:15:32,Twitter Web App,2,19
22/ (The proof of this by the way is the existence of the advertising and marketing industry notwithstanding a lot of neo-classical economic theories to the contrary...),2020-09-01 14:12:48,Twitter Web App,1,17
21/ Because the former gives a much higher rate of return as measured by annual energy savings / invested capital.  Turns out sometimes people buy things for reasons that are not economically "rational"!,2020-09-01 14:11:55,Twitter Web App,1,23
20/ But there's another bigger issue: what is your cost of capital?  Economists assume that's a fixed thing because otherwise their math is impossible.  But it isn't!  If it was people would spend a lot more on window insulation and a lot less on Teslas.,2020-09-01 14:10:19,Twitter Web App,2,12
19/ I could go on but the point is that the utility investments have an implied cost of capital that is far &lt; than renewable power just because of who is likely to build those assets.  Any number that accurately describes the market is telling a distorted story about the tech.,2020-09-01 14:08:47,Twitter Web App,1,13
18/ Some clean energy sources have tax incentives but most non-utility developers don't have enough profit to use them so they have to do really complicated tax-equity deals to use them; a big utility by contrast has lots of profits they can shield with lots of tax structuring.,2020-09-01 14:06:08,Twitter Web App,3,12
17/ Utility-funded generation is built by companies that have monopoly service territories and guaranteed revenue.  Deep access to debt and equity markets.  Local generation is more often funded with cash and has no utility-commission-guaranteed return.,2020-09-01 14:04:43,Twitter Web App,3,17
16/ That's academically true but the problem is that WHO owns a power plant has a much bigger impact on your cost of capital than WHAT kind of power plant you build.,2020-09-01 14:03:32,Twitter Web App,3,21
15/ But leaving those practicalities aside surely there is some macro societal value in calculating the total cost for competing sources to ensure that we are deploying the lowest all-in cost generation.,2020-09-01 14:02:41,Twitter Web App,3,11
14/ (As an aside on that there's a painfully true saying in the power industry: "everyone wants to be the third owner of a power plant".  Because most 1st and 2nd owners fail to earn their target return on capital.  But I digress.),2020-09-01 14:01:28,Twitter Web App,3,19
13/ And note that that's true REGARDLESS of how much you paid for your clean generator.  There is no market guarantee that you'll earn your target rate of return but there is a practical guarantee that the deployment of that generator lowers energy costs for everyone.,2020-09-01 13:59:43,Twitter Web App,2,25
12/ In other words once you build that renewable asset you are (a) going to run it whenever you can regardless of grid price and (b) by displacing more expensive grid electricity will shut dirty more expensive power sources off thus lowering everyone's cost of energy.,2020-09-01 13:58:47,Twitter Web App,3,17
11/ Your solar panel (or wind turbine or efficiency upgrade etc.) requires upfront capital but then requires no on-going operating cost and avoids most/all of those environmental externalities.,2020-09-01 13:57:44,Twitter Web App,2,15
10/ The grid price is for an always-available kilowatt-hour (kWh) that factors in whatever historic capital recovery the upstream generator and wires needed and comes with (non-monetized) negative environmental externalities.,2020-09-01 13:56:33,Twitter Web App,2,17
9/ Now let's ask how we determine whether renewables have achieved cost parity with the competing grid price of electricity.  It's bedeviled by the exact same problems.,2020-09-01 13:54:46,Twitter Web App,2,11
8/ To which any non-economist will reasonably ask... WTF are you talking about?,2020-09-01 13:53:16,Twitter Web App,1,25
7/ Economists will tell you that's easy.  You add up the initial costs amortize them over the life of your garden based on your weighted average cost of capital derive an annual capital recovery charge and divide that by your annual calorie production.,2020-09-01 13:52:33,Twitter Web App,1,14
6/ All those take-out restaurants presumably price their food to recover their upfront costs.  But how should you factor in your upfront costs for seeds mulch rabbit fencing and labor?  How to convert those sunk costs into a variable $/cal?,2020-09-01 13:50:15,Twitter Web App,1,13
5/ To normalize all those values down to a single $/calorie metric is algebraically possible but intellectually useless.  But let's assume we want to do the math anyway.,2020-09-01 13:48:36,Twitter Web App,2,23
4/ A reasonable person my say "Sean that's a dumb question".  One is always available the other is seasonal.  One is healthier.  One has easier access to all the food groups.  One has more protein.  One gives more personal satisfaction.  One tastes fresher and better.  Etc.,2020-09-01 13:47:38,Twitter Web App,1,14
3/ To understand why reframe the question as "at what point will my backyard vegetable garden be cost competitive on a $/calorie basis with the take out food options in my neighborhood?",2020-09-01 13:45:30,Twitter Web App,2,32
2/ It sounds like a really helpful metric.  It's not.  And it's irrelevant to people who actually build own and operate power plants.,2020-09-01 13:44:29,Twitter Web App,1,14
1/ First for those not familiar with the term google it.  Lots of academics &amp; think tanks who write lots of stuff about if/when renewable sources will reach cost-parity with existing dirty power sources.  https://t.co/wwCpe7hIgX,2020-09-01 13:43:52,Twitter Web App,1,11

Russia's interference in our 2016 election was more material than reported in the Mueller report.  Trump lied to Mueller about Wikileaks &amp; Roger Stone.   Current @GOP Senators were involved.

The House-passed HEROES Act included $1 trillion in funding for states and municipalities to ensure they can continue to fund critical services including but not limited to police departments.

READ THIS THREAD.  If you are a far-left protester who thinks rioting will show The Man don't.  If you are a far-right racist who thinks rioting will "own the libs" don't.  Protest peacefully.

The @GOP does not care about the rule of law.  The @GOP does not prioritize American democracy over foreign interference.  The @GOP does not believe they can win a fair and free election.

Keep this in mind every time you hear stories about a #BLM riot.  From Seattle to Kenosha the most horrific acts of violence are often the result of outside right-wing white males.   They are trying to corrupt and confuse the power of peaceful protest.  https://t.co/XQlfpLepGO https://t.co/aXRNfYxWU7,2020-08-29 18:46:13,Twitter Web App,90,253

37/ There is no one in the @GOP who has shown the leadership to confront that rot.  Which means we have to win overwhelmingly at the polls in November.  And we can because the overwhelming majority of Americans are on the right side of this issue.  Now VOTE.  /fin,2020-08-27 22:52:50,Twitter Web App,2,15
36/ But none of that ends if we don't stand up to bullies.  So here we are.  The NY AG may have begun the end of the NRA.  But even if they have the NRA-infected rot within the @GOP is still with us.,2020-08-27 22:51:42,Twitter Web App,1,10
35/ I'm sick of going to vigils for mass shooting victims.  I'm sick of moments of silence on the House floor for shooting victims.  I'm sick of trying to figure out how to make the same damned speech sound fresh and personal to the victims of yet another copy-cat crime.,2020-08-27 22:49:07,Twitter Web App,4,15
34/ I'm sick of every politician who says not to politicize a problem that is innately political.  I'm sick of taking my daughters to Stop the Bleed trainings so they can learn what to do if there is a shooting in their school and they are the first one on the scene.,2020-08-27 22:48:00,Twitter Web App,4,20
33/ But here's the thing.  I don't want to see another mass shooting.  I don't want to see another punk white gang member who put "militia" in the name of his club to get lionized for shooting people in Kenosha.,2020-08-27 22:46:21,Twitter Web App,2,12
32/ And they are increasingly being egged on by the @GOP and their mouthpieces who lack the moral compass to see the risk of letting that genie out of the bottle but fear anyone calling out the rot that lies at the core of the NRA.,2020-08-27 22:44:59,Twitter Web App,1,7
31/ The callers (invariably men) are using every four letter word to yell at our (largely female) staff and interns.  Because they have been trained to believe that their fragile masculinity needs to be defended and that is an appropriate response.,2020-08-27 22:43:57,Twitter Web App,1,10
30/ So they did what they do.  They got their fear-and-noise machine fired up telling people how horrible I am.  And for the last 48 hours my office phones have been ringing off the hook.,2020-08-27 22:42:27,Twitter Web App,3,8
29/ So now to why I'm doing this today.  Because last week I made a (pretty funny I must admit) joke about the toxic-masculinity that has infected this whole debate.  Which apparently drove the right wing nutjobs up the wall.,2020-08-27 22:41:24,Twitter Web App,2,8
28/ And given that strategic intent you can imagine why they might look the other way if the NRA's kleptocrat President was alleged to be abusing his power as a small price to pay for effectively buying the @GOP.  https://t.co/QioSwxRVBm,2020-08-27 22:39:10,Twitter Web App,0,4
27/ Well let's not forget this little gem after the 2016 election when we learned that lots of Russian money was going through the NRA.  Russia after all does have a strategic interest in a dysfunctional American democracy.  https://t.co/G0fFZTUGJI,2020-08-27 22:35:45,Twitter Web App,0,7
26/ So what's the NRA's play here?  If most Americans want stricter gun controls and 100% of Americans don't want to get shot why would the NRA be so callous as to not care?,2020-08-27 22:34:47,Twitter Web App,0,6
25/ On a largely party-line basis it should be noted.  If you wonder why please refer back to tweet #2 in this series.  But the @GOP-led Senate hasn't even bothered to bring it up for a vote.  If you wonder why... you know what to do.,2020-08-27 22:32:00,Twitter Web App,0,6
24/ And the House did pass universal background checks this Congress.  https://t.co/EUHYYk7vcB,2020-08-27 22:30:40,Twitter Web App,0,7
24/ Passing those really simple laws would still leave us living in a country where we have too many damned guns.  But at least it would make sure that we stop selling the deadliest ones and that we try to keep them out of the hands of the wrong people.,2020-08-27 22:29:30,Twitter Web App,4,25
23/ Ditto for background checks: https://t.co/EMgYd2Ja8c,2020-08-27 22:28:34,Twitter Web App,4,26
22/ Now here's the thing.  None of this should be controversial.  Overwhelming majorities of Americans support assault weapons bans.  https://t.co/pnzbH3GpmP,2020-08-27 22:27:56,Twitter Web App,8,30
21/ That's why I introduced the Gun Trafficker Detection Act which would require that anyone who legally owns a gun who fails to keep track of it and fails to report it missing shall be liable for crimes done with that gun.  https://t.co/4C0W6COAIn,2020-08-27 22:25:49,Twitter Web App,10,49
20/ By this point some troll in my feed has likely said "well what about Chicago?".  Let's talk about that.  Chicago unlike NYC or LA is driving distance to Indiana and Wisconsin.  And most homicides in Chicago are done with out of state guns.,2020-08-27 22:24:47,Twitter Web App,11,39
19/ BTW - the Australian buyback program after the Port Arthur shooting that Jeffries mentions?  It's a real thing. And it really worked!   https://t.co/aaXCx3Nqd3,2020-08-27 22:20:42,Twitter Web App,14,36
18/ Well what about self-defense?  First of all this isn't the wild west and you aren't Josey Wales.   The premise is so laughably stupid that I'm just going to leave it to comedians to rebut that one.  https://t.co/wt56Yb5rI9,2020-08-27 22:19:17,Twitter Web App,6,36
17/ Not foreigners.  Not Muslims nor any more "otherized" faith.  Home-grown domestic terrorists who have a propensity for beating women.  Which is one more reason why today's news about the Trump DHS is so troubling.  https://t.co/Mduccngt4l,2020-08-27 22:14:18,Twitter Web App,13,53
16/ And do you know what the best predictor is that you're going to be a mass shooter?  That you're a white male with a history of domestic violence.   https://t.co/tDlkYbdEX8,2020-08-27 22:11:03,Twitter Web App,15,50
15/ First of all perhaps the only good thing about COVID is that it slowed down the rate of school shootings.  It turns out it is politically easier to keep kids out of schools than to keep guns out of schools.  Thanks NRA.  https://t.co/bqWuL93TmU,2020-08-27 22:09:31,Twitter Web App,14,56
14/ It should be noted that most gun homicides are not at mass shootings even though mass shootings stoke more public attention.  But let's talk about those mass shootings for a moment:,2020-08-27 22:08:06,Twitter Web App,4,30
13/ (That last table from Case &amp; Deaton's magisterial &amp; depressing work on "Deaths of Despair": https://t.co/KXJ5BIuiDj),2020-08-27 22:05:25,Twitter Web App,4,22
12/ The US is not dramatically more prone to mental health and depression than other countries nor are we particularly exceptional in the number of suicide attempts.  But our excess of guns makes suicide attempts much more successful in the US. https://t.co/V3wrS3kKTp,2020-08-27 22:04:37,Twitter Web App,10,33
11/ The consequence of having too many guns is that too many people get shot.  And 60% of all the gun deaths in the US are by suicide.  https://t.co/riYEOvm4S2,2020-08-27 22:01:43,Twitter Web App,7,36
10/ Yes that wasn't the majority opinion.  But you know what?  Some times the Supreme Court gets it wrong.  Just ask Dred Scott.  And last time I checked I represented a co-equal branch.,2020-08-27 21:58:34,Twitter Web App,7,38
9/ But what about the 2nd amendment?  Well read it.  That part about a well regulated militia wasn't there accidentally.  And then read Justice Stevens' excellent dissent in the Heller case. https://t.co/wKT6LunQG7 https://t.co/qai49Nxvyq,2020-08-27 21:57:43,Twitter Web App,6,38
8/ In other words you simply can't argue that any American's right or access to guns is in any way constrained.    We have more guns than cars.  That is excessive and obscene.,2020-08-27 21:55:11,Twitter Web App,9,54
7/ If our goal was to get to be #3 - that is to say to live in a country where it is just as hard to get a gun as it is in Yemen we would have to take AWAY 190 million guns.,2020-08-27 21:53:17,Twitter Web App,5,37
6/ We are in fact #1 in per capita gun ownership.  If our goal was simply to get to the #2 country in gun access we would have to take AWAY 121 million guns.,2020-08-27 21:52:16,Twitter Web App,5,37
5/ Now some statistics.  First the US has more guns than people.  If we wanted to give every American a gun (and only one gun) we'd have to take AWAY 40 million guns.  https://t.co/FdNmDGVOMB,2020-08-27 21:50:40,Twitter Web App,22,53
4/ So we either choose to let Americans die or we politicize this fight.  I choose the latter.,2020-08-27 21:47:28,Twitter Web App,9,53
3/ That means that for all practical purposes you cannot win  elected federal office as a member of the @GOP without swearing obedience to the NRA - and anyone who dares call out the NRA's nonsense will be attacked by the worst elements of the far right.,2020-08-27 21:46:51,Twitter Web App,10,52
2/ As @LeadershipNP has shown the NRA overwhelmingly dominates all right-wing political giving.  No one else on the right comes close and no group on the left matches their scale. https://t.co/ioGhiR97oy,2020-08-27 21:44:50,Twitter Web App,20,51
1/ First it's true I said right-wing hate.  I don't want this to be partisan.  I don't want to be partisan.  But just because a bully is partisan doesn't mean you shouldn't take them on.,2020-08-27 21:43:19,Twitter Web App,8,51
What do you do when you see a bully on the street beating up on the less fortunate?   You take on the bully.  Today's bully is the NRA and the right-wing hate they throw at anyone who fights to put preserving American lives over the Wayne LaPierre's slush fund.

There are people in this world who spew hatred.  They thrive on your attention.  Do not retweet them.  Do not engage them.  They do not care whether you like them; they just want your attention.

25/ So embrace clean energy even if only for selfish economic reasons.  Embrace the (temporarily) surge in construction jobs.  But do not make the lazy assumption that there will be no labor dislocation nor that rising productivity benefits all equally.,2020-08-25 23:43:39,Twitter Web App,4,41
24/ That's a good problem to have.  But it is still a problem.  And we won't start seriously working on it until we acknowledge it's existence.,2020-08-25 23:42:15,Twitter Web App,0,18
23/ And taken together that means more wealth per capita.  Our moral challenge is how to ensure that those economic gains are equitably distributed through our society.  How do we ensure that those who helped provide us with yesterday's energy aren't thrown aside tomorrow?,2020-08-25 23:41:35,Twitter Web App,2,39
22/ The further good news is that the subsequent transition will grow our economy for all the reasons that rising labor productivity has always grown our economy.,2020-08-25 23:39:51,Twitter Web App,1,22
21/ The good news here is that any energy system that efficiently allocates capital is going to transition to clean energy.  Less opex on fuel + less opex on labor = higher profit margins.  Capital investment will follow.,2020-08-25 23:39:13,Twitter Web App,0,22
20/ Dishonest for all the reasons noted above.  Patronizing because there are real lives in the balance.  Telling young people to learn about solar is one thing.  Telling a 55 y.o. rail operator to go back to community college to learn thin film deposition is something else.,2020-08-25 23:37:31,Twitter Web App,2,29
19/ Politically far too many have been tempted to look at the increase in green vs. brown jobs and tell people all will be OK - we just need to focus on retraining.  But that's dishonest and patronizing.,2020-08-25 23:35:03,Twitter Web App,0,28
18/ Or to put it in Steinbeck-ian terms we can appreciate the way that automation of agriculture made our food cheaper and still acknowledge that the second half of Ma Joad's life was a lot tougher than the first half.,2020-08-25 23:33:18,Twitter Web App,2,32
17/ We can - and should - embrace and encourage productivity for macroeconomic reasons but we also can - and should - recognize that there is individual pain in that transition to an aggregate improvement in the average standard of living.,2020-08-25 23:32:02,Twitter Web App,4,40
16/ Because at the individual level productivity growth is a good thing if it means you only have to work half as many hours to make twice as much money.  It doesn't feel so good when I get laid off so that you can do my job and yours for the same pay.,2020-08-25 23:30:52,Twitter Web App,1,27
15/ BUT... and this is where we get to what we should be talking about... I suspect you cringed at a few of those examples.,2020-08-25 23:29:33,Twitter Web App,0,17
14/ And so like all forms of technological progress the conversion to a green economy will also drastically boost labor productivity.  That is a good thing.,2020-08-25 23:29:03,Twitter Web App,0,22
13/ Your phone is a job destroyer.  The books you can get without going to a librarian. The magazines that no longer require a printer.  The games that no longer need a video arcade attendant to refresh your stock of quarters.,2020-08-25 23:27:51,Twitter Web App,0,24
12/ And those productivity gains aren't limited to "heavy" industries.  Lots of Wall St. types have been replaced by algorithms.  Much of the more mundane ends of the legal profession have been automated.  AI is revolutionizing disease detection and diagnosis in the medical space,2020-08-25 23:26:12,Twitter Web App,1,24
11/ Our lives are vastly better now that we don't depend on muscle power to churn our butter weave our textiles can our foods or smelt our steel.  More wealth per person = higher standards of living and more free time for us to innovate whole new fields of endeavor.,2020-08-25 23:23:55,Twitter Web App,1,35
10/ But here's the thing: at a macro level that's not a bad thing.  Growth in labor productivity is ultimately the only long term way to ensure economic growth.,2020-08-25 23:22:39,Twitter Web App,0,38
9/ That's not to say we haven't really created a lot of jobs.  But we've created construction jobs.  Lots of them!  But over the life of the investment we are losing more operating jobs than we are gaining in construction jobs.,2020-08-25 23:21:52,Twitter Web App,0,26
8/ In other sectors if you shift from a gasoline ICE to an EV you go from a car that requires maintenance every 15000 miles to one that only needs a tune up every 100000 miles.  Fewer moving parts.  But also fewer service techs per mile driven.,2020-08-25 23:20:57,Twitter Web App,0,28
7/ Directionally this is true for utility-scale solar too (+/- a few operators).  And wind.  And geothermal.  And efficiency.  Even going from coal to cleaner nat gas combined cycle leads to more MWh/unit of labor,2020-08-25 23:19:45,Twitter Web App,2,24
6/ Put 500000 solar panels on 500000 roofs and you will shut down a coal plant but none of those homes will hire new operators.,2020-08-25 23:18:32,Twitter Web App,0,25
5/ A coal plant employs hundreds of people.  Fuel handlers.  Ash handlers.  Rail yard operators.  Boiler operators.  Power &amp; fuel marketers.  A solar panel on your roof does not require you to hire an operator.,2020-08-25 23:17:48,Twitter Web App,0,30
4/ The reason is because our energy infrastructure is old.  Converting to a green infrastructure is essentially the replacement of 1950s tech with 2020s tech.  That necessarily leads to a massive increase in productivity.,2020-08-25 23:16:31,Twitter Web App,1,38
3/ Now what we want to be true: the conversion to a green economy is a net job creation engine and all we need worry about is retraining.  It's a nice story people tell but it's not really true nor is that necessarily a bad thing.,2020-08-25 23:15:36,Twitter Web App,0,36
2/ And moreover significant parts of the fossil sector haven't been major employers for a LOONG time.  America has long employed more bakers than coal miners.

28/ A few final thoughts.  One C-pricing is never going to work for every sector.  It's hard / impossible to meter carbon absorbtion by plants in the ag sector.,2020-08-17 13:55:44,Twitter Web App,1,9

26/ Roughly speaking that is the theory behind cap &amp; trade although virtually every C&amp;T law in practice has distorted that logic by massively over-allocating free allowances to pollute creating too many sellers and distorting market signals.,2020-08-17 13:54:22,Twitter Web App,0,7

24/ So what should C-pricing do?  Simply ensure that carrots = negative sticks.  If a solar investor lowers GHGs by 1 ton a year they should get a revenue stream exactly equal the payment stream that a coal plant gets from emitting that same ton.,2020-08-17 13:52:41,Twitter Web App,0,8
23/ But they're also popular because politicians love to play Santa.  Creating revenues that flow into the government for government to reallocate creates massive political pork.  Doesn't use markets but it's politically tempting.,2020-08-17 13:51:29,Twitter Web App,0,6
22/ So why have those ideas gotten so much traction?  Partly because the fossil fuel industry likes them.  A tax on GHG emissions that doesn't incentivize the construction of lower cost competitive assets is pretty terrific if you want to keep making money selling fossil fuel.,2020-08-17 13:50:41,Twitter Web App,1,7
21/ (And before anyone starts hating on me for that prior point go back and read points 3 and 4 above.  If you want to use command and control or serve some other purpose than GHG reduction you weren't supposed to be reading this far.  :) ),2020-08-17 13:49:32,Twitter Web App,1,4
20/ The worst way though is tax &amp; dividend which by design distributes the proceeds to people OTHER than those who would invest in GHG reduction.  It is designed to guarantee that money isn't used to reduce GHG emissions.,2020-08-17 13:48:12,Twitter Web App,1,7
19/ A carbon tax is the second worst way to do that because it only penalizes emission and then depends on the wisdom of the government to redistribute that money back to those who would invest in GHG reduction.,2020-08-17 13:47:06,Twitter Web App,0,6
18/ So let's make it three things that proper carbon pricing must do: (a) lower GHG emissions; (b) use market forces to do so and (c) drive new capital investment in clean energy assets.,2020-08-17 13:46:14,Twitter Web App,0,6
17/ (As an aside ask C-tax advocates whether a coal plant that gets hit with a C tax will pass the costs along to customers - in which case their investors have no economic disincentive - or their shareholders will absorb the cost - in which case energy prices don't change.),2020-08-17 13:45:01,Twitter Web App,0,6
16/ In the same way putting a tax on CO2 emissions at a coal plant doesn't have any impact on the investment thesis faced by a putative wind farm investor.  They don't know whether the coal owners will absorb the cost or pass it on or how their long-term revenue will change.,2020-08-17 13:43:25,Twitter Web App,0,6
15/ That matters because even setting aside the anti-capitalist flaws in a carbon tax a tax on your competitor doesn't impact your investment decision.  The fines Wells Fargo paid last year did not affect the interest rates you earn at Citibank.,2020-08-17 13:42:14,Twitter Web App,0,4
14/ As a result for C-pricing to change markets they must drive new capital investment.  Once that capital is built it will operate.  But you have to meaningfully change the long-term economics for the investor.,2020-08-17 13:41:11,Twitter Web App,0,6
13/ It's cheaper to drive an EV than it is to drive a gasoline ICE.  It's cheaper to operate a solar panel than a coal plant.  Making your house more energy efficient saves you money every hour.  The existence of a C-price doesn't change that calculus.,2020-08-17 13:40:14,Twitter Web App,0,9
12/ But there's a second point about markets that is equally or more important: almost any asset we build to lower GHG emissions has a lower marginal operating cost BEFORE factoring in C-pricing than the dirtier asset it replaces.,2020-08-17 13:39:10,Twitter Web App,2,11
11/ So a carbon tax ain't a market tool.  Stop calling it that.  The only thing you know for certain about any economist who claims that a carbon tax will lead to efficient capital allocation is that they don't have any real world experience in a market economy.,2020-08-17 13:37:41,Twitter Web App,1,13
10/ No one this side of Karl Marx argues that we should instead pay the government $120 and then leave them to allocate that revenue among putative shoe manufacturers and distributors.  And yet that is EXACTLY what a carbon tax does.,2020-08-17 13:36:08,Twitter Web App,1,9
9/ So the way we efficiently allocate private assets for shoe manufacturing is by ensuring that the $120 I paid for my last pair of running shoes = $120 in revenue to the shoe store.,2020-08-17 13:35:06,Twitter Web App,0,4
8/ (Maybe there's a little stickiness for sales taxes or other costs to maintain functioning markets but you get my point.),2020-08-17 13:32:47,Twitter Web App,0,5
7/ But we can say one thing generally: For markets to work the price a buyer pays should be ~ the revenue a seller gets.,2020-08-17 13:32:12,Twitter Web App,0,6
6/ On the second point: we want to use market forces.  This is SO important and so many C-pricing models have completely forgotten that purpose.  Command-and-control regulation is easy.  Markets are more complicated.,2020-08-17 13:31:07,Twitter Web App,0,7
5/ Taking the first point: the goal of C-pricing is to reduce GHG emissions.  Not to get bipartisan consensus.  Not to reduce deficits.  Not to help disadvantaged communities.  Those are all good things!  But if we do those and don't reduce GHG emissions the policy is bad.,2020-08-17 13:29:32,Twitter Web App,1,18
4/ If you disagree with either of those points don't read on.  [Eddie Vedder voice: "This is not for you."],2020-08-17 13:27:45,Twitter Web App,0,11
3/ There are only two reasons: One to lower GHG emissions. Two because we know from experience (see sulfur trading program Montreal protocol) that markets are powerful tools to monetize externalities and optimize private sector capital allocation.,2020-08-17 13:26:51,Twitter Web App,1,15
2/ (Semantic point: I'm going to use carbon CO2 and GHG interchangeably here.  I get that they're not exactly the same.  Hopefully you get why for these purposes the difference doesn't matter.),2020-08-17 13:25:26,Twitter Web App,0,6

24/ Bottom line is we have to get CO2 down as quickly as possible.  And we have the opportunity to do so in a way that will save a lot of money.  But not if we include CCS in the power sector.  /fin,2020-08-13 14:13:09,Twitter Web App,5,93
23/ (As a separate but important point it's worth noting that even with CCS coal is still dirty.  You still have acid rain-forming compounds asthma-causing particulate.  "Clean cheap coal" is and will always be a fiction.),2020-08-13 14:11:34,Twitter Web App,5,68
22/ But as Homer Simpson says "In this house we obey the laws of thermodynamics."  I'd add economics too.  You can't separate gases without spending capital dollars and burning more fuel.,2020-08-13 14:09:30,Twitter Web App,7,58
21/ So why the heck do we still talk about CCS?  Partly because the coal industry still believes in magic unicorns and has convinced a lot of legislators to do the same.  Partly because we want to believe that maybe there is some tech solution we've yet to figure out.,2020-08-13 14:07:50,Twitter Web App,10,60
20/ So while it is possible to waste a lot of money building those plants (see: FutureGen 45Q) they are never going to operate in a carbon-constrained world that preferentially uses lowest cost power sources.  All you can do is waste your investment $.,2020-08-13 14:06:37,Twitter Web App,2,23
19/ In the power sector CCS is literally the ONLY low-CO2 technology that costs more to build AND costs more to operate.  (e.g. Solar: expensive to build but effectively free to operate.  CCGT: cheap to build but depends on low gas prices to economically operate.),2020-08-13 14:05:00,Twitter Web App,3,36
18/ That means that all else equal a power plant with CCS is going to run a lot less often than one without for purely economic reasons.  Which makes the investment thesis even worse!,2020-08-13 14:03:00,Twitter Web App,1,35
17/ Meanwhile all the ancillary electric loads and fuel expense to separate purify compress and store that CO2 significantly increase the operating costs of a plant with a CCS addition.,2020-08-13 14:01:50,Twitter Web App,2,18
16/ Now let's look at CCS.  Adding gas separation purification and storage will increase the capital cost of your power plant.  That makes it harder to finance.,2020-08-13 14:00:52,Twitter Web App,2,22
15/ Ergo operators have a bias towards least-marginal cost power plants and investors have a bias towards REALLY cheap construction costs.  Nuclear benefits primarily from the former.  CCGT benefits primarily from the latter.,2020-08-13 14:00:05,Twitter Web App,2,27
14/ That means that while we now preferentially operate the low cost (and low CO2) power plants that are already built it's still really hard to attract the capital to build new power plants.,2020-08-13 13:58:51,Twitter Web App,2,27
13/ To be sure the reforms from the 92 EPACT and FERC 888 weren't perfect.  In particular they really don't provide sufficient long-term certainty to drive capital investment.  The increase in renewable construction owes more to long-term tax policy than short term spot mkts,2020-08-13 13:57:54,Twitter Web App,1,31
12/ And that's not because of economics.  Once we decided to preferentially run our lowest marginal cost assets the plants with lots of fuel and ash handling costs inefficient power cycles etc. couldn't justify operation.  Consumers (and the environment) won.,2020-08-13 13:55:34,Twitter Web App,2,32
11/ But in the meantime the coal fleet has collapsed and for the exact same reasons.  15 years ago coal accounted for ~50% of all MWh consumed in the country.  Today it's less than 25% and falling.,2020-08-13 13:54:17,Twitter Web App,3,29
10/ Net result is that US CO2 emissions from power generation have fallen from 1300 lb/MWh to ~925 lb/MWh all while power prices have come down.  This is really important: favoring lower cost power plants drives down CO2 emissions.,2020-08-13 13:53:27,Twitter Web App,9,50
9/ Since those reforms were passed the nuclear fleet has gone from operating 60% of the time to 90%+.  200 GW (roughly 20% of the entire power grid) of high-efficiency combined cycle gas turbines were built.  40 GW+ of renewables were built.,2020-08-13 13:52:29,Twitter Web App,1,30
8/ On balance those market reforms have been an enormous boon to our economy and markets for the simple reason that low-carbon power plants (nuclear wind solar combined cycle gas turbines etc.) also have lower marginal operating costs.,2020-08-13 13:51:26,Twitter Web App,3,33
7/ (Yes I am simplifying a bit and don't mean to gloss over must-run dynamics or other complexities but it's close enough for a twitter thread!),2020-08-13 13:50:22,Twitter Web App,1,37
6/ That means that every power plant in the country looks at the revenue per MWh they can earn the next hour compares that to their marginal cost of generating a MWh and decides whether to run or not.,2020-08-13 13:49:33,Twitter Web App,2,27
5/ First economics: thanks to the power sector reforms created by the 1992 EPACT and FERC order 888 US power markets now dispatch on marginal price.,2020-08-13 13:48:36,Twitter Web App,2,28
4/ The problems with the technology though have nothing to do with technology but are simply about basic economics and thermodynamics.,2020-08-13 13:47:30,Twitter Web App,2,29
3/ State and federal governments have thrown billions of dollars at CCS over the years.  Google "FutureGen" in IL for an example of the scale of waste.  Or the 45Q tax incentive to see where we still throw way too much money away on this dead end technology.,2020-08-13 13:46:47,Twitter Web App,4,36
2/ It is distinct from direct air capture (DAC) that pulls CO2 out of the air and while it can be used in non-power applications (e.g. in cement plants) the useless boondoggle is in power generation applications.,2020-08-13 13:45:26,Twitter Web App,3,39
1/ For the uninitiated: carbon capture &amp; sequestration (CCS) is the technology to capture CO2 from combustion tailgases purify it then store it permanently (typically underground) enabling fossil-fueled sources to be CO2 free.,2020-08-13 13:44:16,Twitter Web App,2,40
In light of the surprising popularity of last week's hydrogen economy rant I'm going to try and make this a thing.  Today's deep dive: why carbon capture and sequestration is a boondoggle that will never play a meaningful role in carbon-constrained electricity markets.

11/ But here's the thing.  None of this is complicated.  None of this is not known to folks in DC in Congress or the WH.

6/ Employers (unlike Trump) are not dumb.  They see what's happening to the economy.  They can appreciate the pressures the next Congress is going to be under with a Biden administration to put science first and get the economy back on track.,2020-08-09 16:25:44,Twitter Web App,13,94

16/ 20 years ago there was talk of advanced lithium ion batteries.  There was also talk of carbon nanotubes to store hydrogen.  Only the former came true.  But the 20 year old theories of a hydrogen economy are still batted around as in the E&amp;E article that started this off.,2020-08-06 18:55:43,Twitter Web App,7,197
15/ 20 years ago the state of the art for hydrogen storage was in 5000 psi compressed tanks.  Today... same thing.  And storing hydrogen in high pressure tanks requires even more energy use making the efficiency even worse than the 48% max calc'd above.,2020-08-06 18:54:09,Twitter Web App,7,203
14/ And while battery storage has made huge technical leaps over the last 20 years from lead acid --&gt; metal hydride --&gt; Li-ion with every cheaper lighter and longer storage batteries H2 storage tech is frozen.,2020-08-06 18:53:02,Twitter Web App,8,208

12/ To be fair that price may be worth paying for if hydrogen has some unique advantages as an energy carrier.  For example if we had a hydrogen pipeline network and didn't have an electric grid.  Or if we had a really good way to cheaply store and transmit hydrogen.,2020-08-06 18:51:22,Twitter Web App,5,206
11/ That means that - before factoring in capital recovery costs - it costs 2x as much to use hydrogen as an intermediary between electricity and electricity.,2020-08-06 18:49:46,Twitter Web App,8,211
10/ So all else equal you get 70-80 MWh out of every 100 MWh you put into a battery and &lt; 50 MWh for every 100 MWh you run through a hydrogen intermediary.,2020-08-06 18:49:04,Twitter Web App,8,226
9/ By comparison an electrolyzer has a electricity --&gt; hydrogen conversion efficiency of ~80% and the fuel cell that then turns the hydrogen back into electricity has an efficiency AT BEST of 60% more typically 30 - 40%.  So max 80% x 60% = 48% round trip efficiency,2020-08-06 18:47:39,Twitter Web App,7,227
8/ Start with just first law efficiencies.  A typical battery has round trip efficiencies of 70-80%.  (e.g. you lose 20 - 30% of the electricity you put into the battery by the time you get it back out.),2020-08-06 18:45:45,Twitter Web App,6,218
7/ And the only way that it makes sense to include hydrogen is if there is hydrogen is fundamentally easier to store and distribute than electricity.  But here's the rub: it isn't.,2020-08-06 18:44:27,Twitter Web App,21,305
6/ The question is why bother with the intermediate steps?  Why convert electricity to hydrogen to electricity?  Why not just use the initial electricity?,2020-08-06 18:43:17,Twitter Web App,14,301
5/ But follow the conversion steps assuming PV.  Sunlight --&gt; electricity --&gt; hydrogen  --&gt; a fuel cell where we turn it back into electricity.,2020-08-06 18:42:30,Twitter Web App,6,209
4/ The promise is from renewable hydrogen.  Make electricity without CO2 from renewable resources (or off-peak nuke) then use the electricity to make zero-C hydrogen with an electrolyzer.,2020-08-06 18:41:23,Twitter Web App,5,223
3/ To understand why note that no one is advocating for natural gas-based hydrogen economy.  Converting natural gas to hydrogen so we can burn it is just an inefficient way to use natural gas.,2020-08-06 18:40:17,Twitter Web App,7,308
2/ Or more precisely not unless someone finds a way to store hydrogen cheaply at high mass &amp; energy density and with super high round trip efficiencies.  Which as of this moment Does. Not. Exist.,2020-08-06 18:39:01,Twitter Web App,9,322

OK so I need to do a brief rant on something hugely important that almost no one cares about.  Humor me.

Two comments on this.  1) The Senate hasn't debated or passed anything.  A McConnell-led Senate doesn't lead - it just waits for the WH to give permission.

@noahqk Also worth noting that the dominant cost of a vehicle is the car payment and insurance (as opposed to the same engine in a power plant where the dominant cost is fuel).  Ergo the best way to drive low-C fuels in transportation is via the vehicle price not the fuel price,2020-08-06 13:46:42,Twitter Web App,0,4
@noahqk It's really just a price issue now that the EV industry has (finally!) realized that they are better off marketing low range but crazy high low-RPM torque vehicles as high-margin sports cars than low-margin but expensive commuter cars.

10/ One final observation.  Ted Yoho has 3 kids.  Two daughters.  They are (roughly) AOC's age.  Think about what it takes to talk to your kid's peers with the anger and immaturity he did.  It boggles the mind. /fin,2020-07-22 00:23:01,Twitter Web App,45,204
9/ Door one is leadership.  Door two is cowardice.  Please @GOPleader.  Lead.,2020-07-22 00:16:56,Twitter Web App,15,92
8/ So at this point the trivial question is for Yoho.  He's retiring.  The question is for @GOPLeader.  He claims to be a leader.  Is he going to lead his base to a more tolerant place or is he going to try to convince try to convince the media to change the subject?,2020-07-22 00:14:22,Twitter Web App,10,77
7/ But if they understand the underlying problem if they comprehend the physical risks that famous women and minorities have to deal with that ain't nearly enough.  Because if they understand that the audience ain't the media: it's their base.,2020-07-22 00:11:12,Twitter Web App,8,69
6/ So the question is what do they do next.  If their goal is to get this out of the news cycle Yoho will apologize to AOC in some public magnanimous way maybe claim he never used the f-bomb and they'll line up behind him and say let's move on.,2020-07-22 00:10:02,Twitter Web App,7,58
5/ I know that @GOP leadership is embarrassed by Yoho's remarks.  But they are also accomplices.  You can't tolerate Steve King or Trump [or many more names that will chew thru 280 char limits] as long as they did and claim to stand for decency.,2020-07-22 00:08:46,Twitter Web App,16,94
4/ Some of that is the dynamics of social media.  But a bigger and more important part is because people follow the signalling of people in power.  When Trump lurks behind Hillary at a debate he signals that's OK.  When Yoho speaks about a female MOC like this he does the same.,2020-07-22 00:06:30,Twitter Web App,15,78
3/ That's serious. But it's also so ubiquitous that we take it for granted.  Think about it - if you wrote a letter to a Member of Congress threatening violence you'd likely get FBI surveilance. But a similar threat on social is just treated as a price of fame. That is ABSURD.,2020-07-22 00:05:00,Twitter Web App,16,96
2/ You'll notice a lot of trolls but look at the tone.  MOCs who look like me get called ridiculous things. Chinese communists.  Socialists. Whatev.  It's so ridiculous you can ignore it  But MOCs who are women or POC get 4-letter words and threats of violence.,2020-07-22 00:02:46,Twitter Web App,20,87
1/ If you want to wade into some darkness go on the Twitter of Facebook comments of male vs female members of Congress.  Pick a couple with similar policy positions to keep it fair.,2020-07-21 23:59:51,Twitter Web App,15,82
Ted Yoho needs to do more than just apologize for this.  He needs to use his platform to explain to his base that is cheering for this why it's wrong.  Thread: https://t.co/n56BnPYMe7,2020-07-21 23:58:57,Twitter Web App,111,454

Coal is massively subsidized but can't compete.  Neither Trump nor any politician can change the fact that businesses and consumers want cheap energy.

12/ But how do we do that?  How do decent people who believe in the value of hard work who embrace the Horatio Alger myth of America tolerate such a system?  By accepting the narrative of inequality.  "We didn't hold them down.  They just weren't capable of rising up.",2020-06-05 13:41:53,Twitter Web App,5,30

Well it turns out that if you forcibly take people from Africa make them work for free for hundreds of years while the wealth of their labor accrues to others then let them free we're not at the same starting line,2020-06-05 13:38:44,Twitter Web App,8,43
9/ The WaPo story above is prose to Phil's poetry.  Read both to understand how - statistically speaking - to be white in America is to be born into wealth you did not create.

7/ Strip away the narrative of inequality and the questions get a little more real.  Under what circumstances would you be unemployed and have no wealth to fall back on?  What would you do in that circumstance?  Not as a white person or a black person.  As a person.,2020-06-05 13:31:05,Twitter Web App,5,34

Or "I wouldn't put my family at risk by committing a crime but THEY might.",2020-06-05 13:28:24,Twitter Web App,5,43

13/ A final point: I hope the Atlantic article is wrong.  But in this moment we are better erring on the side of caution.   Be safe everyone. /fin,2020-05-21 14:37:56,Twitter Web App,1,18
12/ So if you are a Governor Mayor business owner public health director or anyone else with authority to re-open some portion of the economy INSIST on separating that data.  And be hyper cautious about using positive ID rates to inform your decision until this is clarified.,2020-05-21 14:36:43,Twitter Web App,1,16
11/ To be clear we want antibody testing.  We want viral testing.  And we want the number location and results of both posted publicly to inform public health decisions.  But we want them reported separately not conflated as this article suggests is being done.,2020-05-21 14:35:02,Twitter Web App,3,14
10/ And if states/cities use this data to accelerate re-opening they are going to put people's lives at risk.  Not with intent but because they got bad data.  THIS IS A POTENTIALLY HUGE REAL-TIME PROBLEM.,2020-05-21 14:33:27,Twitter Web App,6,18
9/ If the CDC has in fact recently started adding antibody tests into viral tests as suggested by the Atlantic article it would lead to an increase in total reported tests and a falling total positive ID rate exactly as we have seen... but for the wrong reasons.,2020-05-21 14:32:15,Twitter Web App,6,10
@blankslate2017 True but worth noting that epidemelogists know that and factor in that over the course of an infection you're necessarily going to get multiple tests that will go from positive to negative.  (But admittedly obfuscated in simplified charts like the one I posted above.),2020-05-21 14:30:57,Twitter Web App,0,1
8/ As the rate of positive viral IDs falls it is gradually safer to reopen.  On the other hand if we are aware that a rising % of the population does not have antibody protection it is LESS safe to reopen.  A + result from one test is the opposite of a + result from the other.,2020-05-21 14:28:21,Twitter Web App,2,11
7/ By contrast a falling postive ID rate for viral testing means the rate of infection is falling all else equal.  SO... by adding antibody test results into the positive ID results we are mixing apples:oranges in potentially deadly ways.,2020-05-21 14:25:06,Twitter Web App,6,16
6/ So now for (simple) algebra.  Assume that most of the population has not yet been exposed to COVID.  That means most people will test negative for COVID antibodies and are NOT protected if the economy reopens and they are exposed.,2020-05-21 14:23:00,Twitter Web App,7,11
5/ But if this Atlantic piece is correct that the increased testing includes a meaningful increase in antibody rather than viral testing all of those conclusions are backwards.  https://t.co/0qewrUsKtV,2020-05-21 14:21:02,Twitter Web App,7,12
4/ We've also seen a significant increase in testing which would appear to be consistent with our ability to test / isolate / treat people who are positive and to test asymptomatic people for community-based screening.  *In theory.* https://t.co/S2NhyCahCI,2020-05-21 14:19:50,Twitter Web App,4,10
3/ In recent weeks we have indeed seen a falling positive ID rate.  Still above the rest of the world but moving in the right direction: https://t.co/EEreJjJUBr,2020-05-21 14:18:05,Twitter Web App,4,11
2/ A falling positive viral test % ID is also a good thing for public health to the extent it means we have expanded testing capacity to the asymptomatic population and can monitor hotspots (rather than just testing folks who are already sick and more likely to be positive),2020-05-21 14:16:57,Twitter Web App,5,16
1/ Lots of states are evaluating whether to re-open based in part on the % of positive test IDs.  To the extent those tests measure the % of people with positive viral loading a falling % is a good thing.,2020-05-21 14:15:35,Twitter Web App,5,17
This is a potentially huge problem. I have not yet confirmed the data (we're digging) but given the impacts if true it's worth a quick discussion on testing reopening and algebra.  Lives could be in the balance.  Thread:  https://t.co/0qewrUsKtV,2020-05-21 14:13:45,Twitter Web App,39,97

20/ And IF we do all that we will bend the curve and start to look like those countries that are best in class.  We will start to give all Americans confidence that their government is putting science first.  And most importantly we will save lives. /fin,2020-05-04 15:23:29,Twitter Web App,5,27

11/ How should testing be prioritized?  How should PPE / ventilators be distributed?  If hospitals hit resource constraints how should they prioritize patients?

7/ Second: fully implement the Defense Production Act.

6/ And isolation not just by family but by individual.  MA has done this IL now adopting their model.  Meaning that if you get infected you are provided housing and economic support to ensure you can't transmit until you have recovered.,2020-05-04 14:29:13,Twitter Web App,8,28
5/ Contact tracing not just with analog tracers but also digitally.

At the same time we need to ensure that the resources we are providing to hospitals small businesses and so many others flow to people in need and not to antiquated funding formulas that penalize high-population states like IL.

25/ We will continue to provide oversight in this moment.  We will continue to insist on economic and managerial competence from the White House.  And we will continue to look out for the American people.  /fin,2020-04-03 14:59:50,Twitter Web App,2,15
24/ Trump's signing statement on the CARES suggesting that he will not comply with legally-mandated Inspector General and congressional oversight is also problematic - and illegal.  https://t.co/ySBz72nprz,2020-04-03 14:54:32,Twitter Web App,6,11
23/ And (no surprise) Trump seems to be asking for suspicious foreign transactions in this case as well prioritizing O&amp;G owners over their laborers and the American people. https://t.co/6zuGbyYaYi,2020-04-03 14:50:23,Twitter Web App,5,9
22/ But Trump (and Kushner)'s business experience is one of going bankrupt and getting bailed out by their father and/or suspicious foreign transactions.  These are not people who have demonstrated any fundamental understanding of how truly competitive markets work.,2020-04-03 14:47:11,Twitter Web App,10,25
21/ An American economy that is in free fall as unemployment spikes and Americans struggle to pay their bills doesn't sound like an economy that needs higher energy prices right now.,2020-04-03 14:45:12,Twitter Web App,5,16
20/ A massively subsidized industry selling a product into a market with falling demand that is over-leveraged and still can't turn a profit doesn't sound like an industry that justifies more distorting government money right now.,2020-04-03 14:44:11,Twitter Web App,9,21
19/ Finally let's not lose sight of this context.  In May IMF updated their analysis of global energy economics and found that the total US direct and indirect subsidies to the fossil fuel industry are nearly $650 billion PER YEAR.  https://t.co/sZbnh1ouYY,2020-04-03 14:39:24,Twitter Web App,8,4

15/ BUT the voices that have the ear of the Trump White House are not those looking out for oil &amp; gas employees but rather those looking out for oil &amp; gas owners.  To wit:,2020-04-03 14:29:39,Twitter Web App,5,6
14/ That is a sectoral issue that needs to be dealt with and we should of course make sure to look out for those jobs in the oil &amp; gas sector that are at risk from COVID just as we do in other sectors of the economy.,2020-04-03 14:28:33,Twitter Web App,4,2
13/ The rise in unconventional oil &amp; gas production has moved the US from a net energy importer to a net  exporter.  Which means that for the first time in a long time looking just at the US energy sector there is a positive correlation between energy prices and econ growth.,2020-04-03 14:27:10,Twitter Web App,4,3
12/ Now as a mature economy (e.g. one that is does not rely solely on extractive industries) the US benefits much more from cheaper inputs to our mfg and service sectors than we do from higher commodity prices.  BUT...,2020-04-03 14:25:35,Twitter Web App,5,5
11/ What's worse many of the unconventional (e.g. fracking) players have relied on a lot of high-yield debt - and that part of the credit market is seizing up right now in the COVID-driven race for liquidity https://t.co/HzFo9rtS4o,2020-04-03 14:23:34,Twitter Web App,3,4
10/ A lot but not all.  The pure extraction companies (e.g. those businesses who take fuel out of the ground and sell it) are really hurting from lower prices.,2020-04-03 14:21:57,Twitter Web App,3,3
9/ And it should be noted that this is ALSO true of a lot of the energy industry.  If you're a refinery or a power plant or a steel mill falling oil and gas costs mean lower expenses.,2020-04-03 14:20:55,Twitter Web App,3,5
8/ Lower energy costs make this easier.  If you just lost your job and are struggling to pay your rent it is a blessing to have slightly lower gasoline and energy costs.  More generally we can safely say in all economic climates that people prefer to pay less for energy.,2020-04-03 14:19:42,Twitter Web App,3,8
7/ Let's now rise up to look at the larger economy.  In the wake of COVID we are working hard to help American families boosting their cash flows (small bus loans $1200 checks etc) and reducing their expenses (deferring student loans public housing rent etc),2020-04-03 14:18:02,Twitter Web App,3,6
6/ Some have gone so far as to suggest that spot prices for oil could go negative although (for a lot of reasons) I'm dubious it ever goes that far.   https://t.co/HwT1MVp6VZ,2020-04-03 14:15:14,Twitter Web App,3,4
5/ Now add COVID.  Further demand reduction as people stay home businesses temporarily shut down and reduce utility load.  All lead to further reductions in demand and price falls further as would be expected.  https://t.co/0gpsGA2VFg,2020-04-03 14:14:11,Twitter Web App,4,4
4/ Dynamics are slightly different for natural gas (demand same but no equivalent to OPEC disruptions of supply) but the price is also falling. https://t.co/oRgaRckKIl,2020-04-03 14:11:14,Twitter Web App,4,6
3/ Unsurprisingly higher supply + lower demand has led to lower oil prices in recent months https://t.co/6pS71el7Ii,2020-04-03 14:07:37,Twitter Web App,4,9
2/ Some of that is geopolitical (Saudi / Russian alliances OPEC management challenges).  But some is also sectoral.  Rising EV sales more efficient homes urbanification less millennial disposable income all lead to slowing energy demand,2020-04-03 14:05:44,Twitter Web App,5,10
1/ First note that before COVID really hit the US slower demand and US/Saudi/Russian issues were driving the price down (and I discussed this with the Wells Fargo CEO as a potential debt risk): https://t.co/JRn6un6Y5Q,2020-04-03 14:04:13,Twitter Web App,5,14
We need to talk about oil markets and COVID.  Several dynamics are at play that are good for your wallet and good for the environment but are being opposed by oil majors and potentially supported by an economically illiterate White House.  Thread:,2020-04-03 13:59:53,Twitter Web App,38,114
It is true that as the US has become a net exporter falling oil prices are harder on the economy.  But there are still WAY more Americans who's jobs and wealth depend on lower cost energy than there are who work in the extractive sector.,2020-04-02 17:07:17,Twitter Web App,9,36
Just so we're clear - while we're working to minimize American's expenses in the wake of this economic downturn Trump is negotiating to raise oil &amp; gas prices to prop up the O&amp;G industry. https://t.co/0REIHRMSvq,2020-04-02 17:04:39,Twitter Web App,45,144

@ritacolorito I have nothing but respect for the people working in the media to bring truth to light.  But I think we all have to grapple with how to deal with elected officials who get a free pass.

So if you're interested sign up!  We'll give you a list of names you can call to check in.  Make sure they know about local grocery store hours.  Make sure they know about local public health resources.  Maybe just be there for a conversation.,2020-03-25 19:24:29,Twitter Web App,1,19

Re Trump's talk about what we'll do in 15 days.  Ignore it. He's bad at math &amp; doesn't understand geometric compounding. 15 days ago US had ~200 COVID cases.  Today we're over 52000. May we be so lucky as to have today's political zeitgeist 15 days from now.,2020-03-25 01:19:34,Twitter Web App,61,315
Share stories if you can. Write them down. We are in a historic moment that - for all it's flaws - is reminding us how much we all depend on each other.  The reasons we got here are painful.

There are so many lessons we are learning through this COVID-19 crisis about what matters.  Who is important.  Who we depend on.

13/ But compare that to a zingy MAGA own-the-libs tweet from a public figure that can get millions of retweets in less than 24 hours.  That is the danger at this moment.  Science matters. Facts matter.  PLEASE prioritize them over politics.  And stay safe.  /fin,2020-03-22 18:51:05,Twitter Web App,6,46
12/ Yesterday we had ~24000 confirmed COVID-19 cases.  On March 19 we had 12000.  March 17: 5600.  March 18: 2800.  Doubling every other day.  That is what viral transmission looks like.  If we don't immediately lock ourselves down we will have 1 million cases by April 1.,2020-03-22 18:49:01,Twitter Web App,9,29
11/ If people think that they should ignore Governors sharing facts at the expense of Presidents spouting lies because of the political party of those individuals they are potentially killing people.  Not intentionally of course but that is the math of this moment.,2020-03-22 18:46:19,Twitter Web App,3,18
10/ In an earlier era Churchill famously said that a lie can get halfway around the world before the truth gets its pants on.  A lie on social media moves way faster.,2020-03-22 18:44:45,Twitter Web App,4,26
9/ And keep in mind: the geometric math of COVID-19 spread is a lot like the geometric math of social media.  There's a reason we call posts that blow up "viral".,2020-03-22 18:43:49,Twitter Web App,5,20
8/ This is not the time for that conversation for obvious reasons.  But all of us need to understand the consequences of this largely-unpoliced moment and act responsibly.,2020-03-22 18:40:05,Twitter Web App,3,14
7/ We are overdue for a conversation about the accountability of social media firms to police content on their sites.  We can't yell fire in a crowded theater but we do still allow people to say things on social media that - in this moment - are much more deadly.,2020-03-22 18:39:10,Twitter Web App,6,26
6/ And I get it - this may seem awkward.  We have free speech.  We want to be able to say whatever we want.  But understand: what we do TODAY has a direct impact on how many people will be alive in June.  Viral contagion does not discriminate in it's geometric spread.,2020-03-22 18:37:24,Twitter Web App,5,22
5/ In the White House Tony Fauci is exceptional but be aware that anyone in Trump's orbit is under tremendous pressure not to contradict Dear Leader.  So far he's largely dodged that pressure but his ability to speak necessary truths is constrained.,2020-03-22 18:34:38,Twitter Web App,9,45
4/ Meanwhile though we do have some really exceptional executive branch leaders in our states.  @AndrewCuomo is doing a great job as is my Governor @JBPritzker.  They are sharing information that is factual and necessary.  Pay attention to them.,2020-03-22 18:31:26,Twitter Web App,15,65
3/ This is ESPECIALLY true when the President and FoxNews have more interest in propaganda than facts.  We are at a moment where bad information will get people killed.  Be responsible even when those leaders and media outlets are not.  Even more when they are not.,2020-03-22 18:30:03,Twitter Web App,9,34
2/ If you see something on social media that fits your pre-existing biases and you feel that little endorphin rush encouraging you to retweet or share think twice!  If you can't independently confirm it is true don't share it.,2020-03-22 18:28:51,Twitter Web App,11,42
1/ First as I said in my tele-townhall yesterday in the age of social media we are all mini-news aggregators.  What we post what we share gets magnified in ways we don't often appreciate.  This puts the onus on all of us to be better editors.,2020-03-22 18:27:51,Twitter Web App,6,27

And let us be very clear: every politician who has stood up for Trump amplified his MAGA BS given him the latitude to destroy sat down when the times asked them to stand...  They are unfit to serve.

Crazy idea: the hottest economy doesn’t require fed rate cuts to 0% a Dow Jones down 5000+ points in 2 weeks and a massive bipartisan agreement to increase unemployment insurance and food aid.

2 months ago we should have focused on testing and isolation.  Infection rates are outpacing testing rates today and we should be focused on mitigation.

6/ Moving to testing: COVID-19 is spreading faster than our ability to test is ramping up.  That's the result of a lot of botched decisions several months ago but at this point it is what it is.  PH officials have no choice but to prioritize mitigation over testing.,2020-03-13 16:58:50,Twitter Web App,1,13

3/ Related: there is no "right" answer to whether your school should stay open.  Trust that your school officials are making the right choices that balance the needs in your district but that may be different from other districts.,2020-03-13 16:54:12,Twitter Web App,1,14
2/ People are nervous want to be tested are frustrated that tests don't exist want answers... our public health officials get it.  Their success depends on how many people they can quickly treat; be respectful of their time &amp; stress level.,2020-03-13 16:43:06,Twitter Web App,0,20

Every elected @GOP official owns this moment.  They elected him.  They coddled him.  They cowered before him.  They refused to have witnesses at his trial.

18/ To review:    a) Not a hoax b) This is a dangerous time to spread false information. Don't. c) Wash your hands regularly with soap &amp; water. d) Remain vigilant and keep in touch with public health authorities if you have any concerns.  /fin,2020-02-29 14:55:23,Twitter Web App,23,111
17/ And if anyone has evidence of such price-gouging please contact our office: https://t.co/7HBzv66pHd,2020-02-29 14:53:04,Twitter Web App,11,45
16/ Finally there have been some initial rumors of price gouging by companies in the health supply chain.  To any of you who might have the opportunity to do so: don't.  Putting public health at risk for for the sake of short-term profit is evil.,2020-02-29 14:52:25,Twitter Web App,10,32
15/ If you are immuno-compromised for any reason and you have the ability to do so it's not a bad idea to secure more of your prescription meds than usual so that if you need to self-quarantine from COVID-19 you have all the other protection you need.,2020-02-29 14:49:18,Twitter Web App,13,31
14/ The CDC NIH and FDA are working with drug manufacturers and medical equipment providers to ensure there are no supply chain disruptions or shortfalls.  If you are a health provider make sure to keep in touch with them as you plan for your operations.,2020-02-29 14:47:09,Twitter Web App,10,29
13/ While there is an international effort underway to develop a vaccine the (necessary) protocols we use to test such vaccines means that any safe effective and widely available vaccine is 1 - 2 years away.  Be wary of anyone who suggests otherwise.,2020-02-29 14:44:07,Twitter Web App,17,33
13/ Some people have had multiple tests and recieved positive and negative results.  The tests that exist (provided they have been through proper QA/QC testing) are more likely to generate false negatives than false positives.  Take appropriate precautions.,2020-02-29 14:42:35,Twitter Web App,13,27
12/ So what to do if you feel sick?  Go to your doctor get tested for COVID-19.  Take comfort in the fact that all but one of the confirmed US cases were caught by local public health officials (vs ramped up border screening).  That's where the expertise is.,2020-02-29 14:40:32,Twitter Web App,14,33
11/ If you do want the added protection of a mask that's fine but taking off your mask to eat rubbing your mouth under the mask while you wear one etc. defeats the purpose.  Have I mentioned to keep your hands &amp; surfaces clean?,2020-02-29 14:38:04,Twitter Web App,14,35
10/ Since the virus tends to be transmitted from coughs / phlegm it is helpful for folks who are infected to wear face masks and catch the phlegm at the source.  But masks are less effective at protecting healthy people.  (Again washing hands is #1!),2020-02-29 14:37:02,Twitter Web App,23,39
9/ This is relevant only as we think about how to localize and contain the virus itself and any pockets in non-human species that could reinfect us.  But a good reason for those who don't already have one not to eat or traffic endangered species from foreign game markets.,2020-02-29 14:34:18,Twitter Web App,10,38
8/ The coronavirus is a "zoonotic" virus meaning it is transmitted from animals to humans.  The evidence suggests it came to humans from pangolins (an endangered animal used in China for food &amp; medicine) but may have migrated to pangolins from bats.,2020-02-29 14:32:33,Twitter Web App,14,39
7/ To be clear this is based on the disease as it is currently manifesting in the population. It is possible for diseases like this to mutate and evolve into more lethal strains and global public health officials are watching this closely.,2020-02-29 14:30:14,Twitter Web App,14,43
6/ That's good news because it means that if you test positive you'll probably recover.  It's bad news because it's harder to contain than more lethal diseases that more naturally flame out as they lose a base of infected people who are still healthy enough to infect others.,2020-02-29 14:29:30,Twitter Web App,14,37
5/ The good news/bad news about the virus is that it is significantly less fatal than other recent threats (SARS Ebola)  Only ~20% of the people who contract COVID-19  develop severe symptoms  For the balance this feels like a bad cold (fever cough etc),2020-02-29 14:27:44,Twitter Web App,18,44
4/ Now some facts about the virus:,2020-02-29 14:24:49,Twitter Web App,14,39
3/ If you have any questions or concerns the CDC is also maintaining a 24 hour help line: 1-800-CDC-INFO,2020-02-29 14:24:33,Twitter Web App,25,55
2/ Federal and local public health officials are working hard to get accurate information out.  Here's the CDC site to stay current.  Also keep in touch with your city / county public health offices. https://t.co/Uy2gEgBnlo,2020-02-29 14:23:48,Twitter Web App,26,64
1/ Wash your hands with soap &amp; water regularly.  The virus is transmitted by air (coughing spittle etc) and can live on surfaces. If you touch something that someone may have coughed on wash up!,2020-02-29 14:21:40,Twitter Web App,34,81
Coronavirus is not a hoax.  It is a public health crisis.  We will prevent it from being a public health emergency only to the extent public health and government officials share accurate facts and craft a coordinated response thereto.

@GOP 14/ Meanwhile for the @GOP to survive it must find the courage to stand up to Trump and to stand up for those values of Eisenhower Reagan and all those who came before Gingrich led the nihilist take over.  I hope that happens.  But in the meantime it's on the voters. /fin,2020-02-21 14:00:12,Twitter Web App,41,318
@GOP 13/ For the US experiment in democracy to survive we must oppose that influence and must only elect people who take their oath to the Constitution seriously.  That's on the good people of the US regardless of their party affiliation.,2020-02-21 13:59:01,Twitter Web App,50,234
@GOP 12/ When politicians say "the US government is the problem but I want to work for the US government" that's functionally the same thing as saying "I want to destroy the US from the inside".  THAT is why Russia has a desired outcome in the 2016 and 2020 elections.,2020-02-21 13:57:43,Twitter Web App,47,244
@GOP 11/ Note that this is all true regardless of what leaked this week.  It is not that complicated to figure out that is in Russia's strategic interest to have the US government led by people who are opposed to global stability and are willing to attack our institutions.,2020-02-21 13:56:54,Twitter Web App,36,210
@GOP 10/ The leadership in the @GOP meanwhile is either complicit or cowardly but in any event won't defend the Constitution so is a useful if inadvertent Russian ally as well.,2020-02-21 13:55:38,Twitter Web App,39,232
@GOP 9/ I don't personally think that Russia cares about Trump or the @GOP per se other than that they are agents of chaos.  Trump isn't committed to the US unless it benefits him personally.,2020-02-21 13:54:56,Twitter Web App,40,276
@GOP 8/ That is what they did in the 2016 election by sowing distrust among Americans.  It's what they've done in France and Britain.  They sow distrust in the post WWII institutions to manufacture less coordination more chaos... because that is the only way they thrive.,2020-02-21 13:53:42,Twitter Web App,33,219
@GOP 7/ Russia cannot compete with us economically cannot match our influence culturally but wants to be relevant again.  So what's their goal?  Knock us down.  Make us less relevant.  Convince Americans that our democracy isn't worth fighting for.,2020-02-21 13:52:53,Twitter Web App,69,256
@GOP 6/ Meanwhile that other great power from the cold war has had their values expanded through the world. We defended the post WWII order.  We led the expansion of NATO WTO and can take justifiable credit for 70 years of peace in Europe.,2020-02-21 13:52:06,Twitter Web App,25,176
@GOP 5/ Now imagine you are an average Russian.  Or for that matter Putin.  You recall a time not that long ago when you were a great power.  Now your relevancy hinges almost entirely on belligerence and nuclear weapons.  It's tough on the ego.,2020-02-21 13:51:02,Twitter Web App,30,185
@GOP 4/ Their economy is overwhelmingly dependent on oil gas and extractive industries.  Falling commodity prices have crippled them and they have no real ability to diversify.,2020-02-21 13:50:03,Twitter Web App,28,200
@GOP 3/ Their GDP of $1.7 trillion / year makes them slightly smaller than Texas ($1.8 trillion).  On a per capita basis ($28K) they are worse than any US state.  (Mississippi is $31K).,2020-02-21 13:49:29,Twitter Web App,37,220
@GOP 2/ Life expectancy is slightly higher than North Korea slightly lower than Bangladesh.  Massive alcohol consumption.  These are not markers for optimism.,2020-02-21 13:46:31,Twitter Web App,34,208

Postscript: For those saying "No it's all about abortion!" please go back and read the text of the amendment.  It's about treating everyone equally under the law regardless of sex.

(Note: this has never applied to any other Constitutional amendment and others have argued this 7 year note was not binding),2020-02-13 19:48:57,Twitter Web App,6,27
15/ So where are we now?  The amendment passed the House and Senate in 1972 and was sent to the states.  With Illinois and Virginia finally signing on last year we are now at the requisite 38 states required to amend the Constitution.,2020-02-13 19:47:02,Twitter Web App,4,30

8/ So why do we need to do this?  Don't we already have equal protection under the law?,2020-02-13 19:35:36,Twitter Web App,5,24
7/ But with Virginia finally putting us over 38 and with our vote today and *cough* McConnells immediate action to take up in the Senate *cough* we now have all we need to amend the Constitution.,2020-02-13 19:34:42,Twitter Web App,10,56
6/ I say "can now be ratified" because it took us 49 years (!) to get 38 states to finally agree to this measure which was longer than originally contemplated.,2020-02-13 19:33:42,Twitter Web App,5,37
5/ Now as a minor procedural matter the initial amendment which passed the House and Senate in 1972 had language in the preamble that some have taken to imply it would sunset.  What we voted on today was to remove any ambiguity and confirm that it can now be ratified.,2020-02-13 19:32:49,Twitter Web App,10,43

@GOP 16/ What's on the ballot in 2020 is not a contest between Democrats and Republicans.  It is a contest between Democracy and kleptocracy.  Between the rule of law and the law of the jungle.,2020-02-01 23:19:02,Twitter Web App,14,80
@GOP 15/ That's ultimately what the impeachment trial was about: withhold the truth so we can get back to appointing unqualified judges and protecting those who seek to corrupt our democracy.,2020-02-01 23:18:00,Twitter Web App,5,50
14/ Because the @GOP - a once great party - has been totally captured by a base and donor class who's interests are wildly opposed by the majority of the country.  Absent reform they have no path to retain power that is not based on lies and disenfrachisement.,2020-02-01 23:16:57,Twitter Web App,9,73

10/ The fact that you can go from AOC to Joe Manchin and still be in the same party is a testament to a party that reflects the full diversity of the majority of the country.  And that diversity only happened because Americans got engaged after Nov '16.,2020-02-01 23:12:08,Twitter Web App,9,98

I'm upset they confirmed Kavanaugh after he lied under oath to the US Senate.  But yeah let's talk about crocodile tears. https://t.co/tKffrXl7B7,2020-01-25 02:54:04,Twitter for Android,59,414
We all took an oath to defend the Constitution against all enemies foreign AND domestic.  There is no way to listen to the Senate proceedings and not conclude that Trump is precisely the enemy we pledged to defend against.,2020-01-25 01:45:51,Twitter for Android,88,479
Our country is better for Marie Yovanovitch's patriotism courage and public service.  Neither Trump nor his enablers can hold a candle to her.  And they know it. https://t.co/7GrdHrKjot,2020-01-24 16:57:58,Twitter for Android,46,272

@ellysaysopa @angiegaz As is proper.  At least according to my high school typing teacher in 1985.  Also your s's are supposed to look like f's when written on parchment with a quill pen.,2020-01-23 14:52:45,Twitter Web App,0,2
15/ That informs many of us.  Most of us.  The best of us. Demand it of all of us.  It is how democracy survives and thrives.  But do not assume it's absence.  /fin,2020-01-23 14:38:09,Twitter Web App,0,28
14/ Edmund Burke said it best: "Your representative owes you not his industry only but his judgment; and he betrays instead of serving you if he sacrifices it to your opinion.",2020-01-23 14:37:24,Twitter Web App,0,22
13/ So if you want to criticize the politician who's moral compass seems to shift with electoral wins who stands for nothing other than winning the next election have at it.  Those approaches do in fact cheapen our democracy.  But do not generalize those exceptions to us all.,2020-01-23 14:35:45,Twitter Web App,2,24
12/ Are there elected officials who have hit their career peak who could never get a better job than the one they're in right now?  You bet they are.  And they are a problem.  But they are in the minority.,2020-01-23 14:34:27,Twitter Web App,3,19
11/ I don't raise that to ask for your sympathy.  To the contrary - I love this job!  But the idea that one would sacrifice morals and higher ambition to hold this job is an amazingly naive view of our political system.,2020-01-23 14:33:33,Twitter Web App,1,21
10/ Keep this in mind: for most members of Congress leaving public service would allow them with the opportunity to increase their salary spend more time with their family and not have to watch out for opposition trackers every time they shop for groceries.,2020-01-23 14:32:13,Twitter Web App,1,19
9/ Do we have to think about how to win our next election?  Of course.  And in the private sector I had to think about how to secure and maintain the support of my board and my coworkers and my boss.  These are all "political" but that doesn't make them ignoble.,2020-01-23 14:30:26,Twitter Web App,2,23
8/ But when journalists suggest that  the process of elections supercedes our patriotism or other larger ambitions it reinforces a believe that elected public service is venal and appointed public service is noble.  This is fundamentally anti-democratic and dangerous.,2020-01-23 14:28:54,Twitter Web App,8,43

6/ I did not run because I have long aspired to be elected.  And I'm not unique in this regard!  Many (most?) of my colleagues are in this line of work because they care about things bigger than themselves and believe passionately in defending the beauty of our democracy.,2020-01-23 14:26:28,Twitter Web App,5,37
5/ I am in Congress because I am desperately concerned about climate change.  I worked to address it as a scientist then an engineer then an entrepreneur now in Congress.,2020-01-23 14:25:20,Twitter Web App,6,50
4/ But what about those jobs that are elected? You can be a career EPA scientist by traditional job application but you can't serve on the Science Committee in Congress overseeing the EPA's budget and mandate without winning an election.,2020-01-23 14:24:13,Twitter Web App,2,23
3/ We also rightly recognize that they chose to pursue careers that placed public service ahead of the sorts of things (financial reward an unexamined private life etc.) that might otherwise be available to them.,2020-01-23 14:22:42,Twitter Web App,2,27
2/ When we talk about public service in this country - whether our military our firefighters our teachers our diplomats etc. we rightly praise them for their patriotism and sacrifice.,2020-01-23 14:21:18,Twitter Web App,2,35
1/ I won an election. I'm on the ballot in 2020.  By rights that makes me a politician.  But the idea that politicians highest ambition is to win elections is dangerous and totally at odds with the democracy our founders envisioned.,2020-01-23 14:20:12,Twitter Web App,11,77

WH argument that no Congressional subpoena is valid unless voted on by the full House would defang every Congressional committee and by extension our oversight powers.  Any Senator who buys that argument is voting to permanently weaken the US Goverment.  It is anti-patriotic.,2020-01-21 21:20:41,Twitter for Android,37,183

Speaking as someone who’s done 23 town halls in the same period: politicians don’t avoid town halls because they might run into constituents who disagree with them; that’s the nature of the job.   They avoid them when they’re too ashamed of their record to defend it. https://t.co/MxI4Ori9Dl,2020-01-20 15:11:11,Twitter for iPad,87,478
