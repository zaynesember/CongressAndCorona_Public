Aside from lobbying against the #HeroesAct &amp; legal protections for employee and customer safety ALEC is also exploiting the pandemic to gerrymander our districts privatize our public schools &amp; curb federal #COVID19 emergency response. https://t.co/QTyPqGti5O,2020-08-07 20:52:37,Twitter for iPhone,15,22

Without federal aid the virus will continue to ravage our communities killing our loved ones and shuttering our small businesses.

First there’s ALEC’s “State Leaders Say ‘No Thanks’ to Federal Bailout”  This proposal signed by 185 ALEC-affiliated legislators asks the federal government to avoid sending more money to the states.  Read it on ALEC’s website below ⬇️ https://t.co/qXmqqLcvX3,2020-08-07 20:41:22,Twitter for iPhone,11,16
At this moment ALEC is leveraging #CopyPasteCorruption to sell out our public heath in the middle of a deadly pandemic via 2 new model bills ⬇️ https://t.co/zpw6opXOnn,2020-08-07 20:36:30,Twitter for iPhone,17,24
Last but certainly not least-stomach-churning is what ALEC is doing right now—not only exploiting a pandemic that’s killing 1000 Americans daily but actively lobbying states to turn down federal aid needed to save lives open schools safely &amp; prevent further devastation.,2020-08-07 20:31:58,Twitter for iPhone,12,31
Now for ALEC’s decades-long commitment to sabotaging health care.   Before I #ExposeALEC’s role selling out public health during #COVID19 &amp; jeopardizing our economic recovery it’s important to understand their long history of #CopyPasteCorruption on undermining #AffordableCare. https://t.co/xeJdZfgLT3,2020-08-07 20:25:20,Twitter for iPhone,12,17
ALEC’s #CopyPasteCorruption on our justice system has cost parents their children cost taxpayers billions and contributed perhaps more than any other organization to the systemic racism that makes black men 2.5 times more likely than white men to be killed by police. https://t.co/0BmNm1YDWQ,2020-08-07 20:19:44,Twitter for iPhone,9,13
From “stand your ground” “three strikes” and “truth in sentencing” model bills to private prisons and for-profit bail ALEC’s role in designing the inherently racist and inequitable justice system that now draws bipartisan calls to reform cannot be overstated.  #ExposeALEC https://t.co/4tXFsPx6wV,2020-08-07 20:16:02,Twitter for iPhone,12,21
Beyond Stand Your Ground ALEC’s #CopyPasteCorruption on guns helps explain why our communities schools churches and synagogues are subject to mass shooting after mass shooting without any progress on measures as simple as background checks which 90% of Americans support. https://t.co/cQQqxLYabe,2020-08-07 19:52:16,Twitter for iPhone,11,12
This bloody iteration of ALEC’s #CopyPasteCorruption is a lot to unpack. Here’s the backstory. https://t.co/QwPF7V9K7T,2020-08-07 19:48:07,Twitter for iPhone,9,10
Let’s start with Trayvon Martin and how ALEC turned the Florida “Stand Your Ground” law that allowed George Zimmmerman to kill an unarmed black teenager into a model bill that was later adopted in *27* states. https://t.co/JvxkOYp9No,2020-08-07 19:21:36,Twitter for iPhone,14,13
Now that we’ve covered climate it’s time to #ExposeALEC’s #CopyPasteCorruption and how it’s exploited our justice system made it harder to #EndGunViolence &amp; is *currently* selling out public health &amp; jeopardizing American lives to help its donors profit off a deadly pandemic.,2020-08-07 19:12:22,Twitter for iPhone,9,13
Aside from the #CopyPasteCorruption ALEC frequently schedules prominent #ClimateChange deniers to speak at its conferences attended by thousands of legislators.   #ExposeALEC https://t.co/Fhxnmsddxy,2020-08-06 18:46:30,Twitter for iPhone,20,30
Who funds ALEC’s #CopyPasteCorruption? They don’t want you to know.   Because ALEC operates as a tax-exempt non-profit they don’t have to disclose donors like a lobby shop.   Here’s a list of attendees from ALEC’s 2019 meeting via @NickSurgey https://t.co/IeXWP86Ewh,2020-08-06 18:40:09,Twitter for iPhone,25,30
Of course you also may have heard of HB 6 as it’s featured at the center of a corruption and bribery scandal in recent weeks.   Naturally one of the sponsors of the Ohio bill was a *dues-paying member* of ALEC.   #CopyPasteCorruption #ExposeALEC https://t.co/o1x5SQ2Oce,2020-08-06 18:32:07,Twitter for iPhone,14,18
HB 6 in Ohio had all sorts of ALEC ideas all over it. Even if Ohio didn’t take ALEC’s language from its policy briefs the result was the same:   1. Gutting the state’s renewable power generation requirements  2. Eliminating any incentive for clean energy development in the state,2020-08-06 18:30:18,Twitter for iPhone,13,19
John Lewis sacrificed his safety and dedicated his entire life to the fight to protect voting rights for EVERY American.   To honor him we MUST Restore the Voting Rights Act. #VRA55 https://t.co/bWp6rZf66w,2020-08-06 18:07:10,Twitter for iPhone,7,11
Ever since Shelby state lawmakers have been stacking the deck against minority voters—disenfranchising voters through rolling back early voting discriminatory voter ID laws purging voter registration &amp; refusing to allow vote by mail during a pandemic. https://t.co/OIylkrj73K,2020-08-06 17:46:16,Twitter for iPhone,1,6
In 2013 the Supreme Court struck down section 4 of the Voting Rights Act with the Shelby County v.

On the 55th anniversary of the #VotingRightsAct we have a responsibility to honor John Lewis’ legacy by  1. Educating ourselves on the painful history of voting rights in America  2.

But with folks across Illinois now relying on our Postal Service for everything from mail-in ballots to life-saving medications protecting the USPS has never mattered more.  https://t.co/qnmdf8ZPCI,2020-07-28 14:46:31,Twitter for iPhone,21,45
4.2 million Americans have confirmed cases of coronavirus. Children are going hungry and families are struggling to make rent. It is unconscionable that my colleagues across the aisle would even consider cutting off millions Americans unemployed through no fault of their own.,2020-07-28 11:38:49,Twitter for iPhone,36,116
Americans shouldn't have to choose between their jobs and their health parents shouldn't have to choose between their children's education and their safety and voters shouldn't have to risk their lives to participate in our democracy.  https://t.co/HCfWKqFjf3,2020-07-27 20:33:51,Twitter for iPhone,18,70
I am deeply grateful to have had the opportunity to know John learn from him and witness firsthand the strength of his service and leadership.    I extend my deepest sympathy to his family the citizens of Algonquin and McHenry County for this tremendous loss.,2020-07-27 01:40:06,Twitter for iPhone,1,8
Whether it was flood mitigation or access to reliable transportation John was at the forefront working to create and implement solutions.   I knew him to be a humble leader one who shunned the spotlight unless it was a means to facilitate improvement.,2020-07-27 01:39:27,Twitter for iPhone,2,10
In addition to leading the Village of Algonquin for the past 18 years John also served on the McHenry County Council of Governments' Executive Committee where he worked diligently and collaboratively to improve the lives of all those throughout the region.,2020-07-27 01:39:08,Twitter for iPhone,1,4
In the midst of so much loss I am saddened by the passing of yet another dedicated public servant Algonquin’s Village President John Schmitt.  https://t.co/4ZuyBmJzkG,2020-07-27 01:38:09,Twitter for iPhone,13,33

My ESP #FamilyLeave Act is a small but critical step toward giving school employees the support they deserve because EVERY worker supporting our students should be able to take care of their own family.,2020-07-23 23:03:41,Twitter for iPhone,3,11
It is unconscionable that many of the dedicated Americans who care for and teach our children have to choose between their health – not to mention our children’s – and their livelihoods when faced with #COVID19 or any other illness.,2020-07-23 22:59:55,Twitter for iPhone,4,13
But right now the gap in federal law means that many of the workers we entrust to feed transport and teach our students are unable to access basic leave benefits without risk of losing their job.   This is wrong.,2020-07-23 22:58:16,Twitter for iPhone,11,37
Janitorial staff   Social workers   Paraeducators  Clerical support professionals   Maintenance workers   Food service employees   Bus drivers   Work every day to support our nation’s students. They ALL deserve access to family and medical leave.,2020-07-23 22:55:00,Twitter for iPhone,16,61
#COVID19 has made even clearer what we already knew: workers need access to family and medical leave to keep themselves their families and our communities safe.,2020-07-23 22:50:30,Twitter for iPhone,10,32
BREAKING: @SenDuckworth and I just introduced bipartisan legislation to ensure ALL education professionals have access to family and medical leave.,2020-07-23 22:49:12,Twitter for iPhone,73,341

Fatal drug overdoses hit a record high in 2019. As data comes out from recent months there’s no doubt that #COVID19 is making this tragedy even worse.   https://t.co/HytTZcfhfw,2020-07-23 16:13:34,Twitter for iPhone,4,7
Today we passed the Great American Outdoors Act which implements recommendations from our @ClimateCrisis action plan to protect at least 30% of all U.S. lands &amp; ocean by 2030—helping fragile ecosystems &amp; communities become more resilient to the impacts of the #ClimateCrisis. https://t.co/kBScaN1j2G,2020-07-23 01:31:28,Twitter for iPhone,21,103

As we continue working together through this pandemic it’s so important that our firefighters &amp; first responders have the supplies they need to keep themselves &amp; our communities safe. This grant will provide Westmont Fire with PPE &amp; supplies crucial for their #COVID19 response.,2020-07-22 18:08:48,Twitter for iPhone,0,1
Some great news: Westmont Fire Department has been awarded a $38205 federal grant for #COVID19 response from @nUSAHomeland.,2020-07-22 18:05:30,Twitter for iPhone,5,21
Our #NDAA takes major steps to address the #ClimateCrisis including:  ✔️Establishes a new National Academies Climate Security Roundtable ✔️funding for long-range forecasting of seasonal and subseasonal weather patterns.   ✔️$5 million for research into extreme weather events,2020-07-22 00:53:12,Twitter for iPhone,0,7
#COVID19 has taught us that effective pandemic response depends on resilent supply chains &amp; manufacturing infrastructure.    Our #NDAA also Creates the Small Business Industrial Base Resiliency Program committed to purchasing from small business in responding to COVID-19.,2020-07-22 00:52:01,Twitter for iPhone,1,11
Protecting our national security means protecting Americans’ public health.   That’s why our #NDAA also includes $1 billion for Pandemic Preparedness and Resilience to ensure we are prepared for and equipped to respond to future pandemics.,2020-07-22 00:51:26,Twitter for iPhone,2,11
The #NDAA passed by the House tonight reflects Americans values:  ✔️Payraise for our servicemembers  ✔️Funding to clean up contamination of drinking water on our military bases ✔️Sexual assault prevention and response programs,2020-07-22 00:49:55,Twitter for iPhone,1,6
Taxpayer dollars should never subsidize for-profit colleges preying on U.S. servicemembers and veterans.   This afternoon the House passed a bipartisan amendment the #NDAA to close this loophole once and for all. https://t.co/T2NMRAw4eh,2020-07-21 23:04:04,Twitter for iPhone,8,45
#ClimateRisk = financial risk   While I’m glad to see the financial industry sound the alarm and begin to take action it is clear that more needs to be done. https://t.co/eTZdaLL80x,2020-07-21 22:14:00,Twitter for iPhone,2,4
@MorganStanley’s decision will better inform investors and shareholders about the bank’s climate exposure as it’s reported to have invested more than $90 billion in fossil fuels from 2016 to 2019.https://t.co/yp7DP6a0zA,2020-07-21 22:07:50,Twitter for iPhone,3,7
Yesterday Morgan Stanley took a step in the right direction—announcing it will begin disclosing the climate risks arising from its loans and investments. https://t.co/yp7DP6a0zA,2020-07-21 22:03:06,Twitter for iPhone,5,15
The climate crisis is daunting enough – we need to take action now to ensure that it doesn’t spark an additional economic crisis.   #COVID19 has proved the cost of unpreparedness. I’m thrilled that investors are beginning to agree.,2020-07-21 21:18:54,Twitter for iPhone,3,7
That’s exactly what @brianschatz and I proposed in the Climate Change Financial Risk Act. https://t.co/HVA5mZxnqf,2020-07-21 21:15:23,Twitter for iPhone,2,9
But risk disclosure isn’t the only element important to upholding our financial system – the letter also asked the Fed to stress test financial institutions to determine how they’d withstand various climate scenarios and how our financial system would fare as a result.,2020-07-21 21:13:09,Twitter for iPhone,2,5
That’s why @SenWarren &amp; I sponsored the Climate Risk Disclosure Act which would require public companies to report their emissions amount of fossil assets they manage how their valuations would change under different climate scenarios and their strategy to manage that risk.,2020-07-21 21:10:47,Twitter for iPhone,2,6
The volatility caused by climate change could be debilitating to our financial system. The solution is for companies to be more transparent around their exposure to climate-related risks.,2020-07-21 21:08:41,Twitter for iPhone,6,11
Disclosing #ClimateRisks is the right thing to do for our environment &amp; our economy. This letter led by @CeresNews points out why requiring companies to disclosure their climate risks is necessary to avoid an economic disaster caused by climate change. https://t.co/xFodKCRIHf,2020-07-21 21:07:10,Twitter for iPhone,25,47

Bottomline reopening schools safely and keeping our businesses open &amp; our communities safe requires:   1. More Testing  2. Contact tracing 3. PPE,2020-07-21 20:11:42,Twitter for iPhone,3,12
With new cases rising to over 70000 per day and infection &amp; hospitalization rates spiking from coast to coast Trump must finally use the full power of the Defense Production Act to address PPE shortages.,2020-07-21 20:10:44,Twitter for iPhone,8,20
Experts say the United States needs 2.1 million daily tests three times what we have now. Ending this shortage is what the Defense Production Act is meant to help achieve.   Our health care workers can’t wait. The Administration needs to act now.  https://t.co/DI4ADXHGz3,2020-07-21 20:10:13,Twitter for iPhone,11,36
To get through this crisis we need a vaccine that will work for every American. Last month @RepUnderwood and I called on @US_FDA &amp; @HHSgov to ensure diverse and representative participation of women and minorities. https://t.co/k3FVHmWIwe,2020-07-20 21:12:30,Twitter for iPhone,3,15
For too long women have been under-researched in vaccine development. In fact it was only in 1993 that the National Institutes of Health mandated that clinical trials include women for the first time. https://t.co/ZEfR6UUrc7,2020-07-20 20:57:35,Twitter for iPhone,3,21

At a moment when we’re seeing the devastating consequences of ignoring scientists play out in real time it’s not surprising that two-thirds of Americans agree that the government should do more to #ActOnClimate before it’s too late. https://t.co/atNZJi6gny,2020-07-16 22:57:11,Twitter for iPhone,0,3

There’s much more work to be done on this issue and I’ll keep you informed at every step.  But this commonsense market-based bill currently collecting dust on @senatemajldr’s desk is an obvious place to start.   It’s time for the Senate to act. https://t.co/oLuPcQNix5,2020-07-16 00:59:47,Twitter for iPhone,2,8

In his suicide note Kearns said he “had no clue what he was doing” and never intended to “take this much risk.”   Bottom line if @RobinhoodApp is going to continue to market itself to young &amp; inexperienced investors it must take action to ensure they’re protected.,2020-07-16 00:47:14,Twitter for iPhone,3,16

But this problem isn't limited to Wells Fargo – this is a problem for our entire financial sector and it’s just going to get worse.   And as we all remember from 2008 a crisis in the financial sector is a crisis that spreads to the rest of the nation.,2020-07-15 15:15:28,Twitter Web App,8,31

I’m proud that my colleagues and I have come together to move us one step closer to changing the law in order to protect our children from life-long addictions and severe illnesses.,2020-02-28 21:12:40,Twitter Web App,1,5
It is shameful that these tobacco executives have used predatory practices to line their pockets while knowing full-well that our children are developing serious sometimes life-threatening health conditions.,2020-02-28 21:12:40,Twitter Web App,1,7
For years the tobacco companies have developed specific flavors of e-cigarettes and designed marketing campaigns to get our children addicted to their products recycling their playbook from the nineties.,2020-02-28 21:12:40,Twitter Web App,0,4
When nearly 30% of high school students self-report e-cigarette use there is no question that youth vaping has become an absolute epidemic in this country. https://t.co/QVSlGiSzD7,2020-02-28 21:12:40,Twitter Web App,3,12
I encourage everyone to read the @CDCgov information page to learn more: https://t.co/IXilBRoOZV,2020-02-28 19:56:45,Twitter Web App,5,10
As the situation surrounding COVID19 develops I want to remind everyone to take precautions like washing your hands staying home if sick and making sure to disinfect surfaces regularly. https://t.co/ckeK0dwB0O,2020-02-28 19:56:45,Twitter Web App,20,50
This Administration wants a pat on the back for this horrific budget but I’m going to hold them accountable and fight to make real investments in saving our planet.,2020-02-27 21:32:24,Twitter Web App,4,26
@HouseScience @WhiteHouse In reality the #TrumpAdministration has continued their #WarOnScience by cutting 16% of @ENERGY’s R&amp;D funding 35% of @EPA’s R&amp;D funding and eliminating @ARPAE. These proposed budget cuts are anti-science and threaten our country’s ability to combat the #ClimateCrisis.,2020-02-27 21:32:23,Twitter Web App,5,20
Today in @HouseScience Dr. Kelvin Droegemeier the Director of the @WhiteHouse’s Office Science and Technology Policy testified before the committee lauding this Administration’s fiscal year 2021 budget proposal for research and development. https://t.co/uddvvHAtzX,2020-02-27 21:31:39,Twitter Media Studio,9,22
I will also be honoring a member of our greatest generation with an @osssociety Congressional Gold Medal at this town hall.,2020-02-27 20:21:06,Twitter Web App,1,5
REMINDER: Please join me for a 6th District Town Hall this Saturday at 2 PM to discuss recent events &amp; updates on my legislation. As always all are welcome &amp; I’m happy to answer any #IL06 constituent questions. RSVP now: https://t.co/HIhnkuDDw4,2020-02-27 20:21:06,Twitter Web App,4,13
It is absolutely shameful that Mitch McConnell will not give #HR8 a vote. I stand with the majority of Americans in demanding Senate action to finally end this epidemic that is ravaging our communities and schools. #EndGunViolence,2020-02-27 19:00:36,Twitter Web App,10,27
Today marks the 1-year anniversary of the House passing #HR8 a bipartisan bill requiring universal background checks on all gun sales which over 90% of Americans support. Yet this bill has sat on @senatemajldr’s desk despite 45000 Americans dying from #GunViolence in 2019. https://t.co/DR6OgUcSl9,2020-02-27 19:00:36,Twitter Web App,10,33
I’m glad that students from @DePaulU’s School of Public Service several of whom are #IL06 residents got to stop by my office &amp; chat about what it’s like to be a member of Congress.  I wish you all success with your program &amp; I know you all have bright futures in public service! https://t.co/Qkfpy1dTEE,2020-02-26 22:44:00,TweetDeck,2,25
Between 1882 and 1968 4743 people were lynched in the United States. Nearly 75% of these victims were black. Today we have the opportunity to correct this national tragedy with real justice by passing the #EmmettTill Antilynching Act. #OutlawLynching https://t.co/3G5N8vbYEI,2020-02-26 19:02:04,TweetDeck,5,25
I’m so glad I was able to give students from Downers Grove North High School a Capitol tour this morning. It is always nice to share the interesting and deep history of this place with #IL06 residents. https://t.co/dPHZoNXl3K,2020-02-26 16:00:06,Twitter Web App,9,84
In Congress I will always fight to protect safe legal abortion in this country.,2020-02-25 23:09:10,Twitter Web App,5,32
Reproductive health care decisions like these should be made solely by a woman with the counsel of her doctor not by politicians who want to cast their religious dogma on women they know nothing about.,2020-02-25 23:09:10,Twitter Web App,3,33
Make no mistake these two measures are Senator McConnell and congressional Republicans’ latest attempt to limit a woman’s right to live work and make decisions about her health and future.,2020-02-25 23:09:10,Twitter Web App,1,10
As someone who represents the 6th District of Illinois the same District once represented by Henry Hyde a fierce opponent of women’s rights I take particular pride in standing up for women’s rights. https://t.co/GkH9ELPFAU,2020-02-25 23:09:09,Twitter Web App,14,118
I’m proud to have received a 100% rating from @ActiveRetirees. In Congress my top priorities will always include fighting to lower prescription drug prices standing up for seniors against predatory lending scams and protecting their hard-earned pensions. https://t.co/9O89saa9ws,2020-02-25 18:13:00,TweetDeck,12,42
President Trump’s budget proposal aims to cut $5 billion from public education in 2021 alone. This is unacceptable. Public schools are the foundation of success for our children &amp; we need to invest the resources so every child receives a quality education. #PublicSchoolsWeek https://t.co/bGZqpTscqh,2020-02-25 17:15:00,TweetDeck,15,44
I will also be honoring a member of our greatest generation with an @osssociety Congressional Gold Medal at this town hall.,2020-02-24 22:52:38,Twitter for iPhone,2,5

I am incredibly saddened to hear that the world lost the trailblazing scientist Katherine Johnson today. Her work with #NASA broke so many barriers for women people of color and those in #STEM. Although she is gone her legacy will always live on. #HiddenFigures https://t.co/BPs3fXjoTc,2020-02-24 19:53:12,Twitter Web App,21,99
Thank you to everyone who came out to my 6th District town hall in South Barrington this weekend. As always I enjoyed answering your questions about my legislative work and recent happenings in Congress. #IL06 https://t.co/FJEB5aKEPL,2020-02-24 18:52:00,TweetDeck,4,29
One of #IL06’s many strong suits is that we have so many businesses that are looking ahead to the economy of the future. Yesterday I visited @CompTIA in Downers Grove to learn more about their work and to discuss how we can keep growing our local technology sector &amp; workforce. https://t.co/uZysJyybPk,2020-02-21 20:05:00,Twitter Media Studio,3,22
That’s why I am proud to join my colleagues @RepCindyAxne @RepDonBacon &amp; @RepPeteKing to send a bipartisan letter requesting that multiple federal agencies make accommodations for their employees as soon as possible.,2020-02-20 19:02:13,Twitter Web App,4,10
Last year Congress acted on this issue by ensuring that all federal employees have 12 weeks of paid family leave starting in October 2020. But federal workers across the country are facing these important family matters now &amp; need this benefit to avoid dire financial straits.,2020-02-20 19:02:13,Twitter Web App,4,11
For far too long Americans across this country have faced financial hardship when they take time off work to care for a new child or a loved one battling a health crisis. https://t.co/56lwFuFM4v,2020-02-20 19:02:13,Twitter Web App,5,16

Today I was proud to partner with @DuPageHD and several experts to speak to local physicians about the importance of children’s environmental health current challenges in this realm and my legislative work that helps combat &amp; cleanup environmental toxins. https://t.co/iKRA6faFXf,2020-02-19 21:43:47,Twitter Web App,3,30
Last month I led a letter with @SenatorDurbin @SenDuckworth and my Illinois House colleagues to Secretary @BetsyDeVosED asking her to put these bans in place nationwide. Let’s all follow Illinois’ lead. https://t.co/BUJBfrrXm5,2020-02-19 17:07:32,Twitter Web App,0,4
I’m grateful to see Illinois has banned locked seclusion rooms and prone restraint in schools. All students including those with disabilities deserve to be safe at school. https://t.co/3mcAQkEwDv,2020-02-19 17:07:31,Twitter Web App,5,22
I had a great discussion this morning with members and guests of the @GEchamber about a whole host of political and economic issues. In Congress I will always fight for the resources that help the #IL06 business community continue to grow and prosper. https://t.co/LPRMPq50zS,2020-02-18 21:08:05,Twitter Web App,7,31

In addition to voting for the resolution to remove the deadline to ratify the #ERA this week I also voted for @RepMaloney’s bill to establish a @smithsonian Women’s History Museum to honor the accomplishments of the litany of great women in American history.,2020-02-14 21:06:55,Twitter Web App,6,41
February 14 also marks two years since the deadliest high school shooting in US history. But the gun safety movement led by survivors are making an impact around the country. In honor of those we lost we must continue fighting to keep our communities safe. #MSDStrong https://t.co/QWeHfxFOSA,2020-02-14 18:37:15,Twitter Web App,5,21

Yesterday I stopped by @storage_ESA’s policy forum to discuss the current opportunity &amp; challenges surrounding #CleanEnergy technology deployment onto our grid. While I was there I met so many innovative energy professionals and I’m glad that I can be their partner in Congress. https://t.co/B83kimSxOR,2020-02-13 21:14:24,Twitter Web App,7,18
I was proud to celebrate this historic vote with all my hardworking female staffers. #ERANow https://t.co/rcTAHPVEZW,2020-02-13 18:53:27,Twitter Web App,11,55
I urge the Senate to immediately take up and pass this resolution so we move to add the ERA as an amendment to the Constitution and by doing so finally achieve this landmark accomplishment in the fight for equality.,2020-02-13 18:53:26,Twitter Web App,2,17
Although discrimination against women will not end immediately if ERA is ratified this is an important step in ensuring equality in this country and showing that in America we value all of our citizens equally.,2020-02-13 18:47:19,Twitter Web App,2,8
Gender-based discrimination cannot stand – we are all equal. For far too long the legal distinctions of gender have played a discriminatory role against women in employment divorce and property ownership.,2020-02-13 18:47:19,Twitter Web App,1,6
When I cast my vote today to remove the deadline I thought of all the generations of women that have marched and fought tirelessly for the explicit constitutional right of equality dating back to 1923 when the first version of the ERA was drafted.,2020-02-13 18:47:19,Twitter Web App,1,6
Today I was incredibly proud to vote for the #ERA resolution and stand with women across the US giving them this critical legal tool to combat everyday discrimination that they face including pay discrimination pregnancy discrimination &amp; sexual and domestic violence.,2020-02-13 18:47:19,Twitter Web App,7,55
I promise to never stop fighting for #GunViolence prevention measures that make our communities and schools safer. To learn more about this bill read my full release here: https://t.co/jUyrRBjcAx,2020-02-12 22:50:25,Twitter Web App,14,43
I’m proud that this bill has gained the support of @Everytown @NewtownAction @AMarch4OurLives @GiffordsCourage and the @Brady_Campaign.,2020-02-12 22:50:25,Twitter Web App,9,36
In 2019 Chicago seized over 10000 illegally possessed guns; annually guns illegally trafficked across state lines comprise about 60% of this total. The Gun Trafficker Detection Act is poised to stem this onslaught.,2020-02-12 22:50:25,Twitter Web App,7,22
Efforts by states like #Illinois to prevent gun violence are often undermined by traffickers taking advantage of the looser laws in neighboring states like Indiana.,2020-02-12 22:50:25,Twitter Web App,8,23
The bill would also make traffickers liable for any damage done by their guns and makes repeat violators ineligible to buy guns for five years.,2020-02-12 22:50:25,Twitter Web App,7,27
This requirement would help law enforcement identify &amp; prosecute traffickers who often claim their gun was lost or stolen when it turns up at a crime scene across state lines.,2020-02-12 22:50:24,Twitter Web App,7,21
Today I introduced the Gun Trafficker Detection Act with @RepRobinKelly and @RepTedDeutch which would create a federal requirement that gun owners must report their gun if lost or stolen within 48 hours.,2020-02-12 22:50:24,Twitter Web App,16,67
When I ran for Congress I vowed to take legislative action to combat this epidemic: like voting to pass universal background checks and supporting an assault weapons ban.,2020-02-12 22:50:24,Twitter Web App,6,25
The anniversaries of these two tragedies make it absolutely clear that we have a #GunViolence problem in this country where mass shootings happen far too often.,2020-02-12 22:50:24,Twitter Web App,8,22
1 year ago Saturday 5 people lost their lives &amp; many more were injured when a gunman entered an Aurora Illinois workplace &amp; began shooting. 2 years ago Friday a former student entered a #Parkland FL high school &amp; killed 17 innocent students critically injuring just as many.,2020-02-12 22:50:24,Twitter Web App,37,93
🚨LEGISLATIVE UPDATE: I’m proud to announce my bipartisan Clean Industrial Technology Act passed out of @HouseScience &amp; my Promoting Grid Storage Act passed out of @EnergyCommerce.

His answer reaffirmed the need for @SenBrianSchatz and I’s Climate Change Financial Risk Act which would require the Fed to conduct stress-testing on large financial institutions to ensure they are prepared for the future effects of #ClimateChange.,2020-02-11 23:03:42,Twitter Web App,2,11
@federalreserve @FSCDems During the hearing I asked him if the Federal Reserve was taking into account systemic climate-related risks and if so what action the Fed is taking to mitigate these risks?,2020-02-11 23:03:41,Twitter Web App,1,6
Today @federalreserve Chairman Jerome Powell testified before @FSCDems to give us an update on monetary policy and the state of the economy. https://t.co/hix8Q5t9ZS,2020-02-11 23:03:05,Twitter Media Studio,9,15
I am proud that I was given a 100% rating from @ActForParks. Our beautiful #NationalParks bring joy to so many Americans. In Congress I’ll always fight to preserve our national parks and advocate for adequate funding. https://t.co/e4FAUzgEWw,2020-02-11 21:45:53,Twitter Web App,4,37
More backward logic from the Trump Administration: While our nation faces a looming climate crisis the #TrumpBudget proposes to slash EPA funding by 26.5% slash DOE Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy funding by 74% &amp; eliminate the Advanced Research Projects Agency – Energy. https://t.co/mMhqW1hEyY,2020-02-11 18:21:55,Twitter Web App,5,14
That’s why I was proud to vote for a bipartisan bill last night that would direct @DHSgov to take #ClimateChange into account when crafting homeland security policies &amp; emergency planning as well as provide adequate funding to respond to these threats.,2020-02-11 16:44:34,Twitter Web App,6,26
The #ClimateCrisis is not only a threat to our environment public health &amp; financial sector it is also a threat to our national &amp; homeland security and we must actively plan for these challenges.,2020-02-11 16:44:34,Twitter Web App,14,48
I had a great time today speaking w/ mayors &amp; other local officials from across the US &amp; globe on what they can do on the local level to help combat the #ClimateCrisis. A threat of this magnitude takes all hands on deck &amp; I’m glad to see so many dedicated to this important work. https://t.co/WHkiorgAbB,2020-02-10 23:29:22,Twitter Web App,6,38
That is why I have introduced H.R. 5194 Climate Change Financial Risk Act which would require bank regulators to treat #ClimateChange as a systemic risk. I look forward to engaging w/ Chair Powell in @FSCDems tomorrow on how we can work to protect our economy from these risks.,2020-02-10 22:03:05,Twitter Web App,6,25
That is just one of the many systemic risks that #ClimateChange imposes on our economy but which are not previously factored into our economic forecasts.,2020-02-10 22:03:05,Twitter Web App,1,17
It’s estimated that $900 billion of U.S. property is at risk of total loss from rising sea levels. This is magnified through the financial system by the debt securing that property and insurance against the same risks. https://t.co/jTiHcvk3IK,2020-02-10 22:01:33,Twitter Media Studio,20,108

Yesterday in @FSCDems we held an oversight hearing on @CFPB. One of their key responsibilities is protecting student loan borrowers from bad actors but under Director Kraninger’s leadership it has completely failed to comply with the law and protect students. https://t.co/P4tfZlPhxI,2020-02-07 15:00:59,Twitter Media Studio,31,68
#MedicaidExpansion has saved at least 19000 lives since 2014 it is absolutely shameful and inhumane that President Trump values destroying his predecessor’s legacy more than helping Americans access quality affordable health care.,2020-02-06 23:00:35,Twitter Web App,7,25
He is attacking #PreExistingConditions protections in court his @HHSGov has issued countless rulings to undermine the #ACA which has driven up health insurance costs and now he is trying to take away health care from people that cannot afford it otherwise.,2020-02-06 23:00:35,Twitter Web App,9,26
The Administration’s guidance would allow states to rip away health care coverage from low-income Americans particularly one’s that gained coverage under #MedicaidExpansion. Make no mistake this is just the President’s most recent assault in his war on the #AffordableCareAct.,2020-02-06 23:00:34,Twitter Web App,1,9
I am proud to vote tonight to condemn the President’s attempt to cap and slash Medicaid by block granting funds a move which his Administration announced last week. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/7oV5D4cFRe,2020-02-06 23:00:34,Twitter Web App,15,65

The funding will incrementally increase to $475 Million in five years to clean-up &amp; protect Lake Michigan and all of our #GreatLakes.,2020-02-06 16:10:44,Twitter Web App,7,58
Lake Michigan is not only a crucial part of Illinois’ economy; it also brings joy to so many who use it for swimming and boating during the summer months. It is absolutely critical that we clean-up current pollution and ensure its health for years to come.,2020-02-06 16:10:43,Twitter Web App,8,73
One in five Veterans who served in Iraq or Afghanistan suffer from either depression or PTSD. That’s why I’m proud to cosponsor &amp; have voted for the #PAWS4VetTherapy Act.

These #TrumpAdministration officials are making non-partisan processes extremely partisan &amp; are preventing the #CleanEnergy technology deployment we need to combat #ClimateChange.

We cannot get to a zero carbon economy under the current regulatory regime and this bill is a critical and necessary step to achieve that goal.,2020-01-30 22:52:58,Twitter Web App,2,12
This bill serves a critical and necessary function to remind FERC that they have an affirmative obligation to structure rules and markets to ensure that the needs of all stakeholders – consumers investors and the environment – are met.,2020-01-30 22:52:58,Twitter Web App,0,5

Strong national security requires an Administration ready to act with Congress to put the safety and wellbeing of Americans above all else and provides our troops clear directives.,2020-01-30 19:58:07,Twitter Web App,1,4
As we consider a strong national security plan we must take into account new and evolving threats. The Administration must engage Congress and seek the appropriate approvals to expand current military conflicts.,2020-01-30 19:58:07,Twitter Web App,1,5
Ending this out of date authorization is appropriate and will not affect any current military operations in the region. We cannot use obsolete authorizations to start new wars without Congressional consideration.,2020-01-30 19:58:06,Twitter Web App,0,0

However these votes also make clear that any additional military action must have the proper Constitutional checks including Congressional approval.,2020-01-30 19:58:06,Twitter Web App,0,0

#ICYMI: Last week I led a letter to @BetsyDeVosED imploring her to immediately ban seclusion and life-threatening restraint practices in all public schools.

Yesterday I stopped by @Metra’s facilities to learn about their work rehabilitating rail cars. In the past decade they have successfully revitalized 214 passenger cars extending their life by 10-14 years.

@HouseScience In the hearing I urged my colleagues to develop and pursue solutions based on what is scientifically necessary rather than politically palatable. We can’t afford to play politics with a threat of this magnitude. #ClimateActionNow.,2020-01-23 21:39:26,Twitter Web App,1,11
Last week in @HouseScience we received an update from experts on the severity of the #ClimateCrisis.
