Too often we are told we must accept these tragedies.   I refuse to accept that. This Congress refuses to accept that.  Millions of people across America refuse to accept that.  We have passed bipartisan legislation to provide tools to help save lives. We must act.,2020-02-05 16:06:32,Twitter Web App,49,164

“A reasonable plan to control drug prices #ForThePeople is sitting on Mitch McConnell’s desk. If Republicans wanted to do something to help the American people they would bring it to the floor.” -Dr. Jamie Weisman #StateofHealthCare,2020-02-04 20:57:42,Twitter Web App,3,19
“We are in a health care crisis of our own making. These medications are the difference between life and death. And as in my father’s case the price tag is almost unbearable.” #StateOfHealthCare,2020-02-04 20:57:42,Twitter Web App,2,14
“Medicare Part D explicitly prohibits Medicare from negotiating drug prices with pharmaceutical companies. As a result Americans pay far higher prices for medications than any other country.” #StateOfHealthCare,2020-02-04 20:57:42,Twitter Web App,0,9
“The costs of these drugs are so high that people like my father become part of a system that cares more about profit than patients. As he struggled for his life he worried what he would be able to leave for my mother." #StateOfHealthCare,2020-02-04 20:57:42,Twitter Web App,0,8
“I’m attending the #SOTU with Rep. McBath. As a doctor and a patient I know that in three years we’ve made zero progress on controlling runaway drug prices and the suffering of patients goes unchecked.” #StateOfHealthCare,2020-02-04 20:57:41,Twitter Web App,0,9
