Happy Thanksgiving! This year is a little different than others but I pray everyone finds happiness on this day. God bless 🧡 https://t.co/ThazZEIjv2,2020-11-26 22:36:11,Twitter for iPhone,19,257
But until God decides that day has come my promise to you is that I will continue to fight for you and your legacy. To make this world a safer place for families like ours.  Thank you for watching over me as my guardian Jordan. I love you so much.  Forever your mom  Lucy https://t.co/rZqd7cu2gE,2020-11-23 16:46:01,Twitter for iPhone,203,3958
I know that you were not taken from us in vain eight years ago today. It cannot be that way.  Not a day goes by that I don’t think about you but I take comfort knowing that one day I’ll get to hug you again and hear your voice and your laugh when I join you. https://t.co/iZwVtbcwFQ,2020-11-23 16:45:59,Twitter for iPhone,152,2709
I know you’re looking down on me &amp; I pray I’m making you proud - taking on the work that I know you were meant to do Jordan.  Can you believe I’m about to start my second term in Congress? This wasn’t in the cards or on any life plan that we had. https://t.co/FZgoqtI1f9,2020-11-23 16:45:58,Twitter for iPhone,136,2703
You didn’t deserve to die that way but our laws failed you failed us and countless families like ours. I know the man who killed you was not raised the way I raised you.  But I decided not to be silent — to challenge the laws that failed us. https://t.co/rQXF2DylFk,2020-11-23 16:45:56,Twitter for iPhone,149,2334
To Jordan:   I miss you. It’s been eight years since I got to hug and kiss you.   I had no way to know that the last time I hugged you would be the last time I embraced you in this life. https://t.co/i337IaUz6q,2020-11-23 16:45:55,Twitter for iPhone,146,2370

My opponent called me a “one-issue activist.”  @karenhandel - I ran for this seat after my son was murdered because politicians like you refused to stand up to the gun lobby.  It is why I am in office and you are not. Let’s keep it that way ⬇️  https://t.co/ofBU9tEAQJ https://t.co/8mkc5Ak8QU,2020-10-13 23:36:07,Twitter for iPhone,297,1184
In Congress - I fought hard for our communities. I wrote legislation protecting our veterans ensuring quality healthcare - and yes passing gun safety measures.  I am asking for your vote - so we can build upon the work we started. #GA06 #APCDebates https://t.co/71uNyjjrdR,2020-10-13 17:26:23,Twitter for iPhone,46,129
My opponent Karen Handel votes with President Trump 98% of the time.   She led on his policy of separating children from their parents she stands with him on gutting health care and even abortion bans. #APCDebates #GA06 https://t.co/vcbHjDaONR,2020-10-13 17:24:03,Twitter for iPhone,117,298
When COVID-19 started impacting the US I immediately got to work.  I voted for legislation to cut taxes to ease the financial burden facing families get free testing to all who need it and protect our seniors #GA06 #APCDebates  https://t.co/NhQGVFOmqf,2020-10-13 17:19:31,Twitter for iPhone,26,58
My opponent is trying to hide her record.   ❌ She chose to ignore the warning signs from healthcare advocates. ❌ She slashed over a billion dollars from the CDC’s budget.   In contrast - I believe we must always follow the science and listen to our doctors. #APCDebates #GA06 https://t.co/KpHrn5XjE9,2020-10-13 17:12:20,Twitter for iPhone,25,54
Everyday I talk w/ constituents who are hurting due to COVID-19.   Before the pandemic reached our shores I worked across the aisle to draft plans to provide funding for the CDC. When faced with COVID-19 this funding was rushed into the nation’s pandemic response. #APCDebates https://t.co/i6z0O6Ghzc,2020-10-13 17:10:39,Twitter for iPhone,12,37
In Congress I supported reforms that increased funding for election security while Karen Handel has a long history of suppressing GA votes.  As Secretary of State she was found to have violated the Voting Rights Act while also making it harder to vote.  https://t.co/ovDqulnEyx,2020-10-13 17:08:39,Twitter for iPhone,22,60
In the Georgia primary the nation watched as thousands were stuck waiting in line to vote until after midnight and polling stations were left unprepared.   We must ensure voting is fair and transparent in our state. #APCDebates   https://t.co/GE6acPvT9c,2020-10-13 17:07:28,Twitter for iPhone,26,62
Actions speak louder than words. @karenhandel will repeat over and over and over again she wants to protect those with preexisting conditions - yet her record proves otherwise. #GA06 #APCDebates   https://t.co/RebhjbdItM,2020-10-13 17:05:58,Twitter for iPhone,30,46
As a two-time breast cancer survivor I can tell you that when I was facing my own mortality the last thing on my mind was hospital bills.  We need to ensure those with preexisting conditions can still access quality healthcare services. #APCDebates #GA06 https://t.co/tnsrllZfyM,2020-10-13 17:04:39,Twitter for iPhone,43,98
This election is about common sense vs. extremism about electing leaders vs. those who seek personal gain.   We need leaders in Congress who stand on principle not people who sell out to the gun lobby. #GA06 #APCDebates https://t.co/Zk7z6e0ntH,2020-10-13 16:58:40,Twitter for iPhone,20,54

When my son Jordan was shot and killed in 2012 I experienced the worst pain imaginable -- and I stood up to do something about it.   I spoke out against the NRA. I spoke out against the gun lobby.
