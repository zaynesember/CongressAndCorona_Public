Now #China's Communist Party supports an investigation into #COVID19.  The catch?

Even if — and that’s a big "if" — the Taliban are sincere and join forces with the Afghan Army they both lack the military capabilities to keep Al Qaeda and ISIS at bay meaning a U.S. military presence will STILL be required.,2020-02-29 16:18:53,Twitter Web App,1,9
The agreement also says little about terrorist sanctuaries in Pakistan where ISIS and Al Qaeda are headquartered.,2020-02-29 16:18:52,Twitter Web App,1,5
This will fracture the Afghan Army and create a vacuum for ISIS and Al Qaeda 3.0.   We could find ourselves in a much more precarious situation where America is fighting its way back to a sustainable position without local allies losing even more US soldiers along the way.,2020-02-29 16:18:52,Twitter Web App,1,4
@realDonaldTrump However I have two big concerns: the reality of pulling all U.S. troops out on a 14-month withdrawal timeline and the terrorist sanctuaries in Pakistan.   If we remove our presence in Afghanistan too quickly the ethnic minorities historically opposed to the Taliban will rearm.,2020-02-29 16:18:51,Twitter Web App,3,9
