Back in Yates Center to provide a federal legislative update to the Woodson County Farm Bureau.   As a member of Whip Scalise’s USMCA Whip Team seeing this vital trade deal implemented has been one of my top priorities.   #KS02 #ksleg https://t.co/a2ONQhCh8Q,2020-02-29 22:35:11,Twitter for iPhone,4,10
Great to be back in Holton speaking with the Jackson County GOP about  my work as an honorary chairman of @realdonaldtrump’s re-election campaign in Kansas.  2020 is our year to take back the house and deliver a majority for the President.   #KS02 #ksleg https://t.co/3SO6L7NVQT,2020-02-29 18:41:40,Twitter for iPhone,5,11
