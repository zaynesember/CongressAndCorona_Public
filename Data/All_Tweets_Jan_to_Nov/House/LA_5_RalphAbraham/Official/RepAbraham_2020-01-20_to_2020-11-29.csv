.@realDonaldTrump’s proactive response to the Wuhan coronavirus will limit incoming sources of infection identify&amp;treat the infected &amp; protect vulnerable populations from future infection. If China had been transparent &amp; taken outside help to begin with we’d be better off now.,2020-03-12 17:41:29,Twitter for iPhone,11,34
I could not in good conscience vote for a bill that gives politicians special treatment above the rest of America – Nancy Pelosi should be ashamed of this bill. https://t.co/PyJWB7ZsD0,2020-03-12 12:41:10,Twitter for iPhone,15,41

Unfortunately it’s been all too common from Democrat leaders since President Trump was elected. For a senior Senator to threaten sitting Supreme Court Justices unless they rule the way he and his radical followers demand is an attack against all that we as Americans hold sacred,2020-03-05 23:12:30,Twitter for iPhone,5,25
The Senate should take immediate and drastic action to address Senator Schumer's words. This is the kind of incendiary rhetoric that leads to tragic situations like what happened with Congressman Steve Scalise.,2020-03-05 23:12:30,Twitter for iPhone,15,74
I was happy to join my colleagues to pass a bipartisan bill free of unrelated riders and unnecessary limitations to give the President the tools and funding to confront this threat and find a vaccine.,2020-03-04 23:50:18,Twitter for iPhone,2,20
I'm proud to say President Trump has been on top of the Coronavirus threat from day one.

Today @RepClayHiggins &amp; I sent a letter asking @USTradeRep to focus on opening U.K. &amp; Kenya markets to American rice - which is the finest in the world - in future trade agreements. @realDonaldTrump &amp; his trade team have made historic gains for U.S. farmers &amp; manufacturers! https://t.co/1eyEIUf94b,2020-02-26 19:01:49,Twitter Web App,12,22
Justice Sotomayor should step down from the bench. How unthinkable for a sitting Justice to impugn the motives and reputations of her distinguished colleagues in order to score cheap political points.   https://t.co/WYc4SlLqFZ,2020-02-25 23:05:22,Twitter Web App,181,350

The New Way Forward Act shows how far off the deep end Nancy Pelosi’s Democrats have gone by decriminalizing illegal immigration &amp; bringing back those deported.

The American people deserve to know how much money was wasted on the sham impeachment of @realDonaldTrump which is why I joined @RepByrne in support of the Support Taxpayer Accountability for Impeachment (SHAM) Act to call for an audit of funds spent on this charade. https://t.co/MamZFUeyYQ,2020-02-07 12:26:41,Twitter for iPhone,48,137

President @realDonaldTrump's acquittal is great news for the American people.

Bold &amp; decisive leadership from @realDonaldTrump &amp; @IsraeliPM Netanyahu is something we've come to expect. No other President in history has supported Israel so strongly.

I laugh when I hear hypocrites like Warren &amp; Pressley feigning outrage over the deportation of an Iranian with ties to terrorist organizations.
