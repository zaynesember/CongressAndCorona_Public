If you're looking for someone to blame @CheriBustos look in the mirror. Our internal polls were spot-on. It's a sign of poor leadership when you flail &amp; blame others for your own party's shortcomings. Voters rejected what House Dems were selling. Own it. https://t.co/5wWZA4wUEH,2020-11-06 02:32:57,Twitter Web App,19,56

I'm proud to be endorsed by @NFIB FedPAC and small businesses across #IL13. In Congress I'm working to strengthen our #smallbiz by cutting red tape lowering taxes and helping them get through this pandemic with bipartisan initiatives like the Paycheck Protection Program. https://t.co/Q2lfoWfTQP,2020-10-29 21:45:36,Twitter Web App,4,7
Politicians in Springfield and DC have let us down. My opponent is part of the Madigan Machine and she'll bring more dysfunction and corruption to DC. I'm fighting for bipartisan solutions to lower healthcare costs and strengthen #smallbiz. I'd appreciate your vote. https://t.co/ujb3xgy3Tn,2020-10-29 18:00:01,Twitter Web App,6,18
Mike Madigan and lawmakers in the #IL General Assembly should not be given more power to raise income taxes. They've mismanaged taxpayer dollars for decades. This tax hike will hit #smallbiz and farmers in #IL13. Please vote no on the tax hike amendment. https://t.co/NPF1MxbP0h,2020-10-29 15:00:01,Twitter Web App,4,6
I'm proud to have the support of @necanet. I'll always have the back of our working men and women.

It's sad that my opponent Betsy Londrigan is lying about me and my family in TV ads. Independent fact checkers have repeatedly said she's not telling the truth. I'm proud to support the bipartisan Paycheck Protection Program because it saved over 2 million #IL jobs. https://t.co/K1bO99yIPJ,2020-10-28 20:59:57,Twitter Web App,4,7
I'm proud to be supported by the men &amp; women of @UAPipeTrades. I'll always fight for working families even if it means standing up to my own party.

It’s sad my opponent asked a small business owner to lie in a TV ad just so she could win an election. This is right out of the Madigan Machine playbook. Instead of debating issues she smears every #smallbiz helped by the Paycheck Protection Program. https://t.co/wA3oFPKtvl,2020-10-27 16:00:32,Twitter Web App,3,4
I'm proud to be supported by the letter carriers of @NRLCA. The Postal Service is vital to #IL13 communities particularly our rural towns.

Protecting coverage for pre-existing conditions is personal to Rodney. His wife Shannon is a 21-year cancer survivor. That’s why Rodney has introduced and co-sponsored several bills to protect pre-existing conditions. #IL13 #WICSdebate,2020-10-24 00:28:37,Twitter Web App,2,5
Betsy Londrigan wants to put government in the driver’s seat of the American health care system. She supports a govt-run insurance plan that would cut hospital funding by $800 billion and close up to 39 rural hospitals in #IL. #IL13 #WICSdebate,2020-10-24 00:20:26,Twitter Web App,1,3
Rodney has worked with both parties in Congress to fix our nation’s health care system. Rodney supports a bipartisan solution to fix Obamacare and improve upon our private and employer-sponsored insurance system. #IL13 #WICSdebate,2020-10-24 00:18:43,Twitter Web App,1,1

Betsy Londrigan is lying to get elected. Londrigan says she doesn’t take campaign cash from Madigan or corporate interests but that’s not true. Madigan has spent nearly $300k to elect Londrigan and her campaign has received $82k from corporate lobbyists including Big Pharma. https://t.co/alMZMLLHw4,2020-10-01 17:44:20,Twitter Web App,43,36
Betsy Londrigan supports a massive government-run health insurance plan. It could have disastrous consequences for rural hospitals in #IL13 and jeopardize your care.

Betsy Londrigan supports a government-run insurance plan that could force the closure of up to 55% of America's rural hospitals including up to 39 rural hospitals in #IL.

My opponent Betsy Londrigan is part of the Madigan Machine. Londrigan's campaign is bankrolled by Madigan and she raises campaign cash for him. She refuses to call on Madigan to resign even after his implication in a bribery scheme. Londrigan would make Washington more corrupt. https://t.co/Y8BHg0BQqG,2020-09-09 14:00:01,Twitter Web App,14,30
Betsy Londrigan won't call on Madigan to resign because her campaign needs his financial support even though that support comes with Madigan’s corruption baggage. That doesn’t matter to Londrigan though because she will do anything to win. https://t.co/4wHqA77JHp,2020-09-08 22:00:00,Twitter Web App,3,8
Unlike my opponent I oppose the Pritzker-Madigan tax hike amendment because it would raise taxes on many #IL13 small businesses &amp; family farms during this tough economy. That's wrong. #IL politicians don't deserve more power to raise your taxes. Vote no. https://t.co/ugk3WU2YJT,2020-09-04 20:35:11,Twitter Web App,6,13

It was great to join the McLean and Sangamon Co. Farm Bureaus this morning. It's an honor to be named a "Friend of Agriculture." Ag is critical to the #IL13 economy.

Betsy Londrigan announced her support for Mike Madigan's tax hike on #smallbiz and farmers. Londrigan wants to give politicians more power to raise taxes even in this tough economy.

I was at the RNC yesterday. The protests were far from peaceful. When Speaker Nancy Pelosi calls Republicans "enemies of the state" we shouldn't be surprised when this happens. The violence and looting across our country must come to an end. https://t.co/98246zY8RQ,2020-08-28 15:45:00,Twitter Web App,142,131
If we expect frontline workers to go to work every day elected officials should do the same. The people of #IL13 need to know their member of Congress will show up. That’s why I’m committed to participating in 3 in-person debates. https://t.co/7b0Rbh6zxl,2020-08-26 17:08:39,Twitter Web App,2,3

Betsy Londrigan is lying about support she's received from Mike Madigan because she knows he's toxic. Londrigan's campaign has received over $293000 from a political committee Madigan has chaired for decades. https://t.co/j8azLN1SuI,2020-08-18 17:48:57,Twitter Web App,6,10
When Mike Madigan issued his "I'm not resigning" statement last week he took time to say he'll "continue to lead the effort" to elect Democrats like Betsy Londrigan to Congress. That tells us all we need to know about Londrigan. https://t.co/c0kvgnSzwa,2020-08-03 17:30:00,Twitter Web App,3,2

Advocating for funding cuts to hospitals &amp; health care workers in the middle of a pandemic is a terrible idea. Maybe that’s why Londrigan dodged a question about her plan that she’s supported for years. Partisan plans like hers won’t work. https://t.co/EEx4D05lSV,2020-07-06 17:10:31,Twitter Web App,1,0
My opponent @BetsyforIL supports Medicare X also known as the Medicare public option. A key part of the plan’s “cost savings” is achieved by cutting funding for hospitals doctors and nurses by $800 billion over a 10-year period. https://t.co/nJxXXzug7F,2020-07-06 17:10:30,Twitter Web App,1,3
