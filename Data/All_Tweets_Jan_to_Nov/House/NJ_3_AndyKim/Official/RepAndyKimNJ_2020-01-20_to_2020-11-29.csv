So how do we fix this? We need more testing we need guarantees that results are processed rapidly we need to be able to surge testing capacities to hotspots as we see spikes and we need to follow up with major investments in tracing and isolating.,2020-07-15 01:26:07,TweetDeck,1,11
Testing is a tool. The goal isn’t to test – the goal is to get data so you can act on it. Right now we’re failing to act because we’re not taking the data we need to act seriously.,2020-07-15 01:25:27,TweetDeck,0,14
If you’re forced to wait a week to get results it makes contact tracing harder which makes containment harder.,2020-07-15 01:25:18,TweetDeck,0,9
So what about the claim that we’re testing more than before? Yes that’s the case. But in too many places across the country it takes a week or more to get those test results. At that point those tests don’t have the impact they would if you got results within 24 hours.,2020-07-15 01:24:49,TweetDeck,2,8
His obsession only with the total number of positive cases misses three major benefits of testing: to provide proper care to those that test positive to see where the surges are and to ensure we try to isolate/treat those infected and contact trace.,2020-07-15 01:24:16,TweetDeck,1,10
Why? Because following recommendations from public health leaders brings down cases not tests. If you have a rodent problem you don’t solve it by turning the lights out. You solve it by finding out where the mice are coming from and sealing those areas off.,2020-07-15 01:22:01,TweetDeck,1,9
In April rate of positive tests in my state of NJ was around 50%. We were running fewer than 7k tests per day. We’ve completed almost triple that per day now but the number of positives is much lower than in April.,2020-07-15 01:21:20,TweetDeck,2,8
Therefore halving the tests then halves the number of positive cases. In that line of thinking doubling testing doubles the number of positive cases.,2020-07-15 01:21:04,TweetDeck,1,10
First let’s look at why it’s wrong. An important flaw of his logic is that it assumes that positivity rates for infections are constant across all levels of testing and throughout our country.,2020-07-15 01:20:33,TweetDeck,2,9

In a lot of ways New Jersey’s signers to the Declaration of Independence reflected our early country; they weren’t perfect and in some cases deeply flawed but they built a foundation for us to continue to build upon. That’s our charge and our challenge on this day.,2020-07-04 15:42:16,TweetDeck,2,9

Finally on this #IndependenceDay I want to recognize Richard Stockton who is more than just a namesake of a rest stop on the Turnpike. Stockton was captured early during the war and suffered as a prisoner.,2020-07-04 15:41:52,TweetDeck,0,6
Witherspoon may have been a critical voice in the freedom of our country but strongly opposed the freedom of enslaved Blacks in America. You can read more about his views that put him on the wrong side of history here: https://t.co/2K8q0U9CZr,2020-07-04 15:03:47,TweetDeck,0,7

The next NJ founder I want to recognize on this #IndependenceDay is Francis Hopkins. He wasn’t just a lawyer and a judge; he was a musician and composer. He helped design the great seal of our country and went on to marry Ann Borden – the founder of Bordentown.,2020-07-04 14:06:00,TweetDeck,3,13
The next of NJ's founders I want to recognize is John Hart. He didn't live to see the end of the Revolutionary War but was the Speaker of the NJ Assembly and a farmer. He was a community leader and public servant.,2020-07-04 13:46:00,TweetDeck,2,10
Abraham Clark was a lawyer and was known as "the poor man's councilor" because of his dedication to helping those without means. He died in 1794 but his legacy lives on in Clark Township.,2020-07-04 13:11:30,TweetDeck,1,12

And last Admiral Giroir is the US representative to the WHO but made it clear he wasn’t consulted on the decision to withdraw from the org. If we’re not listening to him who are we listening to?,2020-07-02 17:26:10,TweetDeck,2,8
Second I was disappointed that yet again I can’t get a straight answer on why in the height of this crisis my request for a third federally-backed testing site was turned down by the White House.,2020-07-02 17:25:52,TweetDeck,2,11
@COVIDOversight First the Admiral made it clear that we are not flattening the curve and testing isn’t leading to more cases – the spread of the virus is leading to more cases.,2020-07-02 17:25:21,TweetDeck,3,11
A couple hours ago we finished our most recent hearing of @COVIDoversight. I had a chance to talk with Admiral Giroir one of the top officials leading the federal response to the Coronavirus. The full video is below but there’s a couple things worth pointing out (thread) https://t.co/WVe2x5KPwy,2020-07-02 17:24:44,Twitter Media Studio,18,32
Only 45 mins away from our next hearing. This one comes at a critical time as we're seeing record numbers of new cases - I'll be talking with top Administration officials to see if we're ready for these new cases and if we learned from the failures of the past months. Tune in. https://t.co/d3SQImWC4y,2020-07-02 12:16:04,TweetDeck,14,38
Disturbing to see the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs parroting the line that more testing is responsible for more cases. https://t.co/D6VOUz4jJD,2020-07-02 11:19:43,Twitter for iPhone,13,20
We just finished the NDAA markup with a fully bipartisan 56-0 vote. A bill named after our ranking member @MacTXPress and achieved by putting aside our parties to work for the national security of the American people. https://t.co/1CG6RMp4lP,2020-07-02 03:49:21,TweetDeck,8,26
This is a start but until we get this public health crisis under control it can’t be the end. https://t.co/0LB9oehWwO,2020-07-02 00:49:18,Twitter for iPhone,6,21
Tomorrow's @COVIDOversight briefing comes at a critical point in our fight against this virus - we've either learned from the mistakes of the past months and we're ready to handle the massive surges we're seeing or we're in for some tough days ahead. https://t.co/d3SQImWC4y,2020-07-01 22:38:06,TweetDeck,6,10
We're still in the middle of this crisis and this is a good move to make sure that our small businesses get the help they need until they can safely reopen. Glad to see it done in a bipartisan way. https://t.co/ezHbKeXTOu,2020-07-01 21:48:14,TweetDeck,3,7
When an #NDAA amendment is good you don't have to say a lot to show your support. This amendment by @RepSlotkin would make sure dangerous PFAS chemicals in our communities are cleaned up to the highest standards. Proud to be a strong yes on this effort. https://t.co/dg7ipE8T1G,2020-07-01 21:08:27,Twitter Media Studio,24,81
Hope isn't going to save a single life or bring a single person back to work. The Administration owes us a national strategy to put an end to this crisis. Four months in and we're still waiting. https://t.co/l42g4Os1JJ,2020-07-01 19:30:48,TweetDeck,20,48
Earlier today I joined @MSNBC to talk about the next steps to support our small businesses during the Coronavirus crisis. But that's not enough - we need to pass aid to our states and localities who are hurting so much right now. Check out the clip below. https://t.co/QxmDGmpbB2,2020-07-01 19:08:23,Twitter Media Studio,8,13
We know that PFAS poses real risks to our families - especially to those living near our Joint Base. That's why last year I led the charge to phase out its use and I'll be continuing that fight today during the NDAA process. https://t.co/JydJZ800Qm,2020-07-01 18:12:27,TweetDeck,4,6
It's been a month and a half since the House passed the Heroes Act. The Senate needs to come to the table and act in a bipartisan way to deliver immediate relief to the American people during this crisis. https://t.co/AVkmGINwr5,2020-07-01 12:29:00,TweetDeck,3,7
I wanted to share another question from our town hall this Sunday - one that I've gotten a lot - is about military equipment when it comes to our police. Should equipment used in Iraq and Afghanistan be used in our streets. My answer below. https://t.co/kmuZ0JQp7Y,2020-07-01 11:56:26,Twitter Media Studio,9,12

and finally because our Joint Base is a pillar of our community it's important that it stand ready for any crisis. It's why I pushed for more base resiliency exercises that will keep our Joint Base at the center of crisis response. https://t.co/tRsFLs5eUJ,2020-06-30 21:06:45,TweetDeck,0,4
Because jobs are important I was proud to deliver more than $40M back home for the HELIOS laser which will bring jobs to Burlington County. https://t.co/bXKzarvkno,2020-06-30 21:05:45,TweetDeck,0,4
Next I was proud to work with @RepStefanik to pass the SERVICE Act which would lower military spouse unemployment by making a key job training program accessible to additional military spouses.,2020-06-30 21:04:22,TweetDeck,0,5
Third I was able to work with my colleagues to phase out the use of dangerous PFAS chemicals which have lead to dangerous conditions in drinking water near our Joint Base. More on that here: https://t.co/tjRDmdFX47,2020-06-30 21:02:47,TweetDeck,0,6

The jobless claims underscore the importance of the vote I'll take tomorrow to deliver relief to working families and small businesses throughout Burlington and Ocean Counties who have been impacted by this crisis.,2020-03-26 22:12:28,TweetDeck,3,5
My daily update for today is on two big numbers: 3.3 million jobless claims filed in just the last week and 2492 new positive cases in NJ in the past day. https://t.co/Lr90R52HbJ,2020-03-26 22:11:31,TweetDeck,5,10
and if you want to know exactly how we should do that. I broke it down into three easy steps. https://t.co/zPnLyH1r5L,2020-03-26 16:20:52,TweetDeck,2,2
It’s not just enough to have supplies to last today we need to be prepared for the long haul. The best way to do that is to fully utilize the #DefenseProductionAct. https://t.co/9Z8XIoAtiw,2020-03-26 16:19:40,Twitter for iPhone,15,26
Good information here on a day when we saw the largest jump in new jobless claims in history. It's also why tomorrow I'll be voting to expand unemployment insurance for people impacted by this crisis. https://t.co/wr2RsPT2oa,2020-03-26 14:09:34,TweetDeck,10,16
If you're in Burlington County there will be a testing site up today from 1-5pm. You can find more information below. https://t.co/7pxdosakvE,2020-03-26 13:53:31,TweetDeck,5,7
This is just one of a number of steps we're working on together to bring more resources to NJ. It's going to take a lot more but we're going to keep fighting for it and fighting for you as long as this crisis continues.,2020-03-26 13:41:41,TweetDeck,1,2

This is a battle being waged in our communities by our friends and family. They need all the help they can get and one way to get it to them would be a major disaster declaration.

This is progress but we can't solve this problem incrementally; we need to take bold steps to not only produce what we need today but what we're going to need as this crisis continues. #DefenseProductionAct #coronavirus https://t.co/4ZlPVdrkc2,2020-03-24 13:54:52,TweetDeck,12,38
A good reminder of the challenges we face. Our health care workers still need PPEs and our counties still need tests. We can't fully enact an economic recovery until we fully end this public health crisis. https://t.co/WXJ1mZz0jQ,2020-03-24 12:23:05,TweetDeck,6,14

You may know this program from efforts post-Superstorm Sandy to help our communities recover. In a lot of ways #coronavirus is like a very slow moving Hurricane. It'll require a lot of the same tools we used then and supporting the CDL program is an important one.,2020-03-23 15:23:30,TweetDeck,0,4
The #coronavirus pandemic is having a massive impact on our families and businesses but it's also having an impact on our counties and towns. We can help by strengthening the Community Disaster Loan Program. https://t.co/HoRnXqhb7K,2020-03-23 15:21:33,TweetDeck,1,5

ICYMI earlier today @GovMurphy announced 590 new positive #Coronavirus cases in New Jersey. We're still fighting to get more equipment for our first responders and health care personnel. My update and an explainer on the #DefenseProtectionAct here: https://t.co/lstNmnFH11,2020-03-22 21:39:07,TweetDeck,6,9
PPE shortages aren't a federal or a state issue; it's an American issue. And it needs every level of American government working together to solve it. https://t.co/tSU3EtQt3Y,2020-03-22 17:21:49,TweetDeck,18,34

Finally we need to provide immediate support to manufacturers who will have to make changes to their facilities to meet these needs. Funding and waivers should be passed and passed now.,2020-03-22 16:31:40,TweetDeck,4,8
Next we need to not only immediately provide a national order for equipment we need to stand up transparency and tracking mechanisms to make sure there's enough and they're getting to where the demand is and will be.,2020-03-22 16:30:24,TweetDeck,4,7
Let's walk through it step by step. First we need to increase command and coordination. FEMA's National Response Coordination Center and the Defense Logistics Agency should take point on a national effort instead of having states fend for themselves.,2020-03-22 16:29:27,TweetDeck,4,8
This morning I called on the Administration to fully enact the #DefenseProductionAct. Having helped manage crises before at the White House I thought I'd provide a plan to help get them started: https://t.co/zPnLyH1r5L,2020-03-22 16:27:43,TweetDeck,40,51
More than a week ago we asked the Administration for more PPEs. We've gotten a fraction of that request. Now demand has outstripped what we've asked for so we asked to fully enact the #DefenseProductionAct to produce more. That hasn't been done. Absolutely unacceptable. https://t.co/IYMNJ7mA3P,2020-03-22 14:25:33,TweetDeck,457,1097

Worth mentioning this again and again until we have enough tests to accurately measure the extent of the #coronavirus outbreak. https://t.co/8vUa0ePMCt,2020-03-12 01:38:12,Twitter for iPhone,12,29
Talking with @tax about the impact the #coronavirus outbreak will have on small businesses who are always the first to get hit in an economic crisis. https://t.co/QVeM4O3MfA,2020-03-11 20:10:46,Twitter for iPhone,2,7
While we're working - at the county state and federal level - I want to take a moment to recognize the incredible work our doctors nurses home health care professionals and others are doing. They're absolute heroes in this crisis and we need to give them our full support.,2020-03-11 19:07:03,TweetDeck,11,21
I've also heard frustrations about testing delays which is why I joined with @RepJoshG and my NJ colleagues to call on the @CDCgov  to provide answers on when we'll get confirmation on pending cases and when we'll get more testing capacity. https://t.co/qzenO5yg59,2020-03-11 19:05:05,TweetDeck,9,13
It's why I voted last week to provide $8.3 billion in funding; $14 million of which was just announced is heading to NJ to make sure our state can continue its efforts to keep people safe.,2020-03-11 19:03:06,TweetDeck,5,5
These are professionals on the frontlines. They need more supplies faster testing and assurances that critical programs like Meals on Wheels will be supported as we see further disruptions from this outbreak.,2020-03-11 19:01:32,TweetDeck,8,22
There's a lot going on today as we work to contain the #coronavirus outbreak. Let's start with our most vulnerable population: seniors. Earlier today I heard from a number of senior health leaders who shared their concerns. I take those very seriously. https://t.co/tgsaYkVow4,2020-03-11 19:00:18,TweetDeck,6,12

Meredith is a small business owner in Moorestown and submitted testimony to the @HouseSmallBiz today to tell my colleagues about the impact these taxes are having on our businesses on NJ.

Earlier this week I was proud to announce a $1.9 million grant for Burlington County to fund early education and head start programs. There's more to do - for both Burlington and Ocean Counties - and we're going to fight to deliver for our children. https://t.co/XhVbk3pDme,2020-03-01 17:54:00,TweetDeck,6,17
Finally we should also take a moment to recognize that American families have lost too many loved ones in a war that has spanned a generation. Let us remember their sacrifice.,2020-02-29 16:47:34,Twitter for iPhone,1,2
This deal must be a starting point not an end towards our aim of supporting the Afghan people and providing real regional stability and prosperity in the years to come. It must be done in a way that ensures America's security interests are kept and our homeland remains safe.,2020-02-29 16:47:01,Twitter for iPhone,1,7
Implementation will matter however and this deal does not resolve real concerns I have about protecting our homeland integrating the Afghan government and securing civil rights protections especially for women.,2020-02-29 16:46:20,Twitter for iPhone,0,2
This announced peace deal could be a major step towards ending America’s longest war. A few thoughts... https://t.co/k3HIh4OAcc,2020-02-29 16:45:35,Twitter for iPhone,1,7
Some good information here for veterans in our community who want to take advantage of the great benefits at JBMDL. https://t.co/aRkKehABgT,2020-02-29 15:39:00,TweetDeck,2,6

We can do better. The House has taken action but as long as the Senate refuses to act we're going to continue to lose America's sons and daughters to gun violence. That isn't acceptable and we should all continue the fight to get #HR8 and #HR1112 signed into law.,2020-02-27 15:36:52,TweetDeck,3,5
In the past year we've lost an estimated 38000 Americans to gun violence. Let's provide some prospective: Mt. Laurel  and Berkeley Township both have about 41k people. Willingboro has 32k and Lacey has 30k. We lose the equivalent of one of our communities every year.,2020-02-27 15:34:10,TweetDeck,2,8
It's been one year since the House passed #HR8 - common-sense gun safety legislation that would make sure we not only have background checks that make our communities safer but that the vast majority of Americans support.,2020-02-27 15:30:31,TweetDeck,5,13
It is long overdue and I'm proud to have voted to make this right. This bill is named after #EmmettTill but is in the memory of the thousands of African Americans who were tragically murdered over the span of decades. https://t.co/x5SXxAK2Sm,2020-02-26 21:48:00,TweetDeck,4,23
I'm also proud to work with @RepRatcliffe on this bill. Regardless of party or part of the country we all have neighbors like Judith who have given so much to our country. It's time we gave them the remembrance they truly deserve.,2020-02-26 19:49:54,TweetDeck,0,4
In my remarks I mention Judith Young one of my neighbors in NJ who lost her son in the Marine Barracks bombing in Beirut in 1983 and a fierce advocate for Gold Star Families. I'm proud to carry Judith's story to the House Floor and her cause forward.,2020-02-26 19:48:33,TweetDeck,1,7
Honoring our Gold Star Mothers and Families is the least we can do for those who give so much for our country. Earlier today I took to the floor to call on my colleagues to pass this bill. https://t.co/Z7UsKVTufe,2020-02-26 19:45:56,TweetDeck,4,13

The answer was simply staggering: 70 percent said yes. With the vast majority of us living on streets in need of repair the time is now to come together and invest in infrastructure. #MovingForward,2020-02-20 17:11:43,TweetDeck,2,6
We all know that investing in our roads and bridges is a major priority but I wanted to find out from people like you in our community how bad things have gotten. Recently I conducted a survey of people in#NJ03 to ask a simple question: is your road in need of repair?,2020-02-20 17:10:50,TweetDeck,5,13
We’ve taken real steps in the past year that would make a serious impact in the lives of NJ seniors. Bills like #HR3 would put money back into the pockets of people in our communities and ensure they can afford the care they need. https://t.co/j4bi6oIFjl,2020-02-19 21:48:15,Twitter for iPhone,4,6
Making progress on lowering the cost of prescription drugs starts with listening to our experts back home. Thanks to the team and patients at @encompasshlth for sharing their stories and ideas to make progress on this issue. https://t.co/EF04POY4jv,2020-02-19 21:46:30,Twitter for iPhone,4,13

There’s a lot we can do to help those who need it most especially seniors. I’ve fought to pass #HR3 and we need to expand programs that help make sure that no one ever has to choose between food on the table and the prescriptions they need. https://t.co/zPnGaBVAF5,2020-02-17 16:08:44,Twitter for iPhone,4,16
Boyd’s Pharmacy in Florence is an institution and a place where a lot of our neighbors stop to get their prescription drugs.

Spent time today with veteran leaders in Willingboro and got a chance to hear what’s on their minds.

I want to thank @RepTrentKelly @RepTimRyan @CongPalazzo @TomColeOK04 and @RepSlotkin for their leadership in bringing this bill forward. Together we're going to get this done and give our members of the Guard and Reserve the support and thanks they deserve.,2020-02-13 21:42:02,TweetDeck,2,8
We have Guard and Reserve personnel at our Joint Base who depend on that hazard duty pay to pay bills and put food on the table. Pay equity would make a big difference for them.,2020-02-13 21:39:40,TweetDeck,1,6
When members of the Guard and Reserve go into harm's way they don't get equal hazard pay with Active Duty service members. Today I introduced a bipartisan bill to change that. https://t.co/hxCi2IJz3i https://t.co/BHjoF8Kp6Q,2020-02-13 21:38:52,TweetDeck,3,18

@DonaldNorcross Let's be clear: New Jersey faces real threats that @fema funding addresses. We've seen our places of worship threatened amid a rise of anti-Semitism. We've got critical infrastructure that the rest of the country depends on. All could be made more secure with this funding.,2020-02-13 14:32:56,TweetDeck,2,7

There’s a reason why our Founding Fathers gave Congress the authority to authorize war: because sending our sons and daughters into harm’s way requires the voice of the American people. My statement on today's vote on #AUMF: https://t.co/alCENsr3AR,2020-01-30 21:40:14,TweetDeck,7,13
