@RuichiTina @NancyTwinMama Respectfully you are misinterpreting this section of the bill. The bill created a NEW 2020 tax credit - i.e. the economic impact payment people are getting right now. The IRS is distributing the new credit immediately rather than waiting until 2021. That's what this section says,2020-04-16 22:37:44,TweetDeck,0,3
@RuichiTina @NancyTwinMama Q20. Is the Payment taxable as 2020 income?   A20. No the Payment is not income and you will not owe tax on your Payment. It will not reduce your refund or increase the amount you owe when you file your 2020 tax return next year.  See here (question 20): https://t.co/0K4uYkwx4u,2020-04-16 22:28:14,TweetDeck,0,1

@EvolvingNation @ResisterDoggie Yes and that money is required to be spent to cover employee wages salaries and benefits. In any case your original assertion was trillions in corporate bailouts and now you're talking about $46 billion in payments to cover wages.

@EvolvingNation @ResisterDoggie ...the $500 billion in loans to impacted industries requires the companies be prohibited from conducting stock buy-backs subject to public disclosure laws and have to pay the government back for the loan.

@EvolvingNation @ResisterDoggie I'm not sure what you are quoting but it is not accurate.

It makes no sense to spend millions of dollars spraying toxic chemicals into the very same waterways where we are currently spending billions of dollars on restoration projects.

Those who put on the uniform risk their lives to protect our democracy. The very least we can do is ensure those serving around the world are able to participate in that democracy by casting a vote by mail ballot.

You’ve heard me say it before but it bears repeating… if we wouldn’t put it in the bathtub with our children then it doesn’t belong in our waterways.  That’s why I believe @MyFWC should implement alternatives to spraying! https://t.co/S5l9jWjZyh,2020-02-21 16:00:00,TweetDeck,16,48

FL Oceanographic Society @AudubonFL &amp; @SCCF_SWFL are right. Managing Lake O artificially high is not sustainable.
