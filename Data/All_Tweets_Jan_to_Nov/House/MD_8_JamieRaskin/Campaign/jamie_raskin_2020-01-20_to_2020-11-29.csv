Dropped into the @NHforWarren Manchester Field Office to chat with fired-up volunteers about why I’m in this fight for @ewarren.  I got to write it down too ⤵️ https://t.co/c5OuzNeoht,2020-02-02 01:30:02,Twitter for iPhone,6,51

Thank you @JohnDelaney for your classy and substantive run for President. At a time of danger and despair for our Republic you spread some badly needed hope and calm. You made Maryland proud.,2020-01-31 21:52:47,Twitter for iPhone,2,30

Hey @JillianSinger_! I talked to your Mom and am bringing up her famous home-made authentic Maryland banana bread to share with all the #TeamWarren volunteers who join us in braving the New Hampshire cold. Psyched to see you! https://t.co/J5NEPEfDKM,2020-01-30 20:36:56,Twitter for iPhone,20,153
Psyched to join #TeamWarren in NH this weekend and to meet all the great people up there I’ve been hearing from. From Maryland to New Hampshire we’re going all out to knock on doors and get votes for @ewarren. #FITN https://t.co/YuXSzf5cmv,2020-01-30 20:22:19,Twitter for iPhone,22,87
Wonderful to see my little activist constituent Xiomara &amp; her Mom @ElenaHung202 who is President &amp; co-founder of @LittleLobbyists in this uplifting video. The whole family’s fighting to protect health care for all our people and so is @ewarren! We’re in this together. https://t.co/aeOjq6aS3Z,2020-01-30 19:21:56,Twitter for iPhone,2,13
Exhilarating to speak to hundreds of Potomac polar plungers and climate defenders before they dived in for change with @CCAN. Forgot my bathing suit so had to go in like this. Anything to fight climate chaos. https://t.co/zhk7nBF5OG,2020-01-26 02:09:06,Twitter for iPhone,4,47
Senator Elizabeth Warren has always stood with the American people and she has always stood with me. I am proud to stand with her now in her surging and historic campaign for President. Go @ewarren! https://t.co/8Mv3ITijmG,2020-01-22 16:15:10,Twitter Media Studio,1166,4899
