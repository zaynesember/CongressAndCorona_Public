Democrats are focused on attacking President Trump.  Tonight the President will focus on how we’re winning again:  -Our booming economy -Lowering healthcare costs for American families -Securing our border -Protecting America’s national security,2020-02-04 17:58:04,Twitter for iPhone,5464,22600
Schiff says he has no regrets about this impeachment sham.  REALLY??  He doesn’t regret: -Saying “we have not spoken directly with the ‘Whistleblower’” - Saying “we... look forward to the ‘Whistleblower’s’ testimony” -His misleading “parody” of the President’s call,2020-02-03 23:09:42,Twitter for iPhone,14258,49778

Remember the witness count is already 17 to ZERO in favor of Democrats.  But they need one more (still none for us) to make their case?  How’s that fair?,2020-01-29 15:30:14,Twitter for iPhone,14137,45503
Schiff's memo: "DOJ met the rigor transparency and evidentiary basis needed to meet FISA's probable cause requirement."  WATCH Inspector General Horowitz debunk that false claim: https://t.co/zmibWG8VAF,2020-01-28 21:24:31,Twitter Media Studio,7130,15629
House Democrats STILL haven’t scheduled a hearing for Inspector General Horowitz to testify about his report on the FBI’s FISA abuse.  Thankfully Horowitz is here on an unrelated matter. And we have plenty of questions for him. https://t.co/NWCgUXsB7E,2020-01-28 20:02:04,Twitter for iPhone,9441,26838
Dems run the same old play.  Someone leaks to the New York Times what a draft of Bolton’s book supposedly says.  This last-ditch effort doesn’t alter the four fundamental facts of the case.,2020-01-27 19:11:57,Twitter for iPhone,12033,43253

Democrats are never going to stop. They’re desperate to attack President Trump by any means necessary.

.@RepAdamSchiff spent his opening arguments trying to relitigate the fake “Russia collusion” narrative.
