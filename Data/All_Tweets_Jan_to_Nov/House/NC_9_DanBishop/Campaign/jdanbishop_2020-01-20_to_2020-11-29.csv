Levin is right that SCOTUS is likely also to be intimidated. But POTUS should keep fighting and the Roberts Court will make a fateful choice to bow to power or follow the law.

The claim is plenty cogent: disparate practices on ballot cure inculcated by Secy Boockvar without legislative dispensation and obstruction of count-observers placed the Trump campaign at an actionable disadvantage. This court is just too cowardly to do what the law commands.,2020-11-22 06:52:44,Twitter Web App,1,7
The dismissal order is a game of dodge ball. The reasoning rejecting the Trump Campaign's assertion of competitive standing is so childlike it should be written in crayon.

15/Oct 7 in Judge Osteen’s court in Greensboro is going to be 🔥  So far timely action by federal judges has prevented corrupt state officials and partisans from using a rogue state judge to throw open this election to widespread fraud. May they stick to their guns. #ncpol,2020-10-04 04:26:31,Twitter for iPhone,41,105
14/Remember this is the politicized manipulation of the State Board of Elections by Roy Cooper under legal advice by Josh Stein in collusion with Marc Elias facilitated by Dem Judge Collins. Cooper Stein and Collins are all candidates on this year’s ballot. Brazen.,2020-10-04 04:26:31,Twitter for iPhone,30,61
13/Judge Dever restrained all of these actions and transferred the new cases to Judge Osteen for further proceedings.,2020-10-04 04:26:31,Twitter for iPhone,13,32
12/“The memoranda by materially changing the electoral process in the middle of an election after over 300000 people have voted undermines that confidence and creates confusion for those North Carolinians who have yet to cast their ballots.” Pp 15,2020-10-04 04:26:31,Twitter for iPhone,15,35

10/“At bottom the NCSBE has ignored the statutory scheme and arbitrarily created multiple disparate regimes under which N.C. voters cast absentee ballots.” ...,2020-10-04 04:26:30,Twitter for iPhone,14,37
9/Dever pointedly noted that NCSBE hid the ball from Judge Osteen and found that it “materially changed the rules under which the election was taking place” on Oct 2 after “319209 NC voters had cast absentee ballots.  Pp 9 14  Then Judge Dever really unloaded:,2020-10-04 04:26:30,Twitter for iPhone,16,35
8/Judge Dever’s order recognized that NCSBE’s “settlement” eliminated not only “the statutory witness requirement” but also “the statutory deadline for absentee ballots” AND the requirement of in-person mailing or delivery by the voter.  Pp 7-9,2020-10-04 04:26:30,Twitter for iPhone,13,35
7/And then TODAY in litigation filed last Sat by legislative leaders Trump campaign RNC and yours truly   Judge Jim Dever entered this beast of a TRO in Raleigh federal court:  https://t.co/BMPb58qavG,2020-10-04 04:26:30,Twitter for iPhone,14,40

5/So with that background here’s the new action since Wed.:  Thu Oct 1: Notwithstanding Osteen’s Sept 30 order Dem state Judge Collins obligingly approved the Dem plaintiffs’ &amp; Elections Bd’s collusive settlement which would end protections from fraud in absentee balloting.,2020-10-04 04:26:29,Twitter for iPhone,13,31

3/The same Dem attacks also failed before a 3-judge state court in early Sept.

12/Judge Osteen was so alarmed by this development that he ordered the lawyers to appear before him "at the earliest possible date and time" for further inquiry including "[w]hether this court's [prior] order was used or asserted as a basis for a revision of election procedure.",2020-10-01 03:20:07,Twitter Web App,19,51
11/Judge Osteen further noted that SCOTUS often reiterates that "lower federal courts should not ordinarily alter the election rules on the eve of an election" and that NCSBE has now altered procedures while voting is in progress and on the pretext of compliance with his order. https://t.co/TjmkMlAeZ0,2020-10-01 03:20:07,Twitter Web App,16,40
10/Doing so was NOT required by his previous order Judge Osteen observed and was not consistent with that order which "upheld the one-witness requirement and ... found that it was a reasonable measure to deter fraud." #ncpol,2020-10-01 03:20:06,Twitter Web App,11,21
9/Although Cooper’s/Stein’s media acolytes credulously swallowed Judge Osteen unprompted came to the same conclusion as legislative leaders: “it now appears that ... [NCSBE] has eliminated the one-witness requirement under the guise of compliance with this court’s order.”#ncpol,2020-10-01 02:24:33,Twitter for iPhone,9,27

7/This is what legislative leaders observed last week effectively eliminates the witness requirement. Omitting the witness triggers the sending of a form. The voter signs the form certifying his own identity; no witness ever enters the picture. Cooper/Stein terms. #ncpol,2020-10-01 02:24:32,Twitter for iPhone,9,30
6/What precipitated Judge Osteen’s order was Elections Board’s (NCSBE) filing of “notice” of “numbered memo 2019” which advised county boards of elections not to disqualify ballots lacking a witness signature if the voter signs a form certifying the voter’s identity. #ncpol https://t.co/WenDsDxY2w,2020-10-01 02:24:31,Twitter for iPhone,13,23

2/Ex meru motu is a legal phrase meaning when a court acts on its own initiative and not in response to a litigant’s motion or complaint. Today’s order was ex meru motu which in itself is unusual.  #ncpol,2020-09-30 21:59:45,Twitter for iPhone,26,56

@burn_watch Signed log books for in-person delivery of absentee ballots at county boards of elections is how irregularities were discovered in 2018 #NC09. A few individuals were signing in 100’s.

In NC the Cooper/Stein collusive settlement with Mark Elias would count all ballots harvested like this and left in an unattended drop box.

Well over a month ago Trump was blocking flights from China and saving American lives. Obama would have waited the month and then talked to experts so he’d “know whose ass to kick.”  https://t.co/BNrafTeFla https://t.co/AphZZpDrql,2020-03-13 01:47:59,Twitter for iPhone,20,41
So Dems have decided not to put the #NoBanAct on the floor after all.  They know that @realDonaldTrump’s decision (and power) to ban flights from China (and now Europe) has saved lots of American lives.  #Covid_19 https://t.co/iPW3vEp5OM,2020-03-13 01:25:44,Twitter for iPhone,20,59
