While the CARES Act gives relief to millions of Americans current law doesn't allow $500 payments per child to taxpayers with dependents over 16.

This is the proper decision by the IRS. With all that everyone is going through during this crisis Social Security recipients should not have to jump through a series of hoops to get their relief.

I attended many #ERA events representing the League of Women Voters in the early 1970s.
