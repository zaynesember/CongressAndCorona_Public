After the infamous thumbs down vote on ACA repeal I began working on a health care solution. It's one of the most contentious issues in politics but it shouldn't be. Contrary to popular belief the GOP has a plan: the bicameral bipartisan Fair Care Act. https://t.co/BSSFwIal93,2020-10-14 14:14:56,Twitter Web App,6,13
The Trillion Trees Act takes clear bipartisan action against carbon emissions and toward a cleaner environment. @realDonaldTrump has supported the idea from the start and his executive order enables federal agencies to work together on our shared goals. https://t.co/rvoKZPnale,2020-10-13 19:56:09,Twitter Web App,6,14
Democrat senators are using the #ConfirmationHearing to talk about the ACA but this accepts a precedent of SCOTUS legislating from the bench. It must end. It’s not the Court’s duty to legislate health care it’s Congress’s. Bills like the Fair Care Act are the solutions we need.,2020-10-12 15:12:23,Twitter for iPhone,4,4
Think Republicans don’t have a health care plan? False! @SenatorBraun and I introduced the Fair Care Act of 2020 with dozens of bipartisan provisions. It gives more Americans coverage at lower costs even people with preexisting conditions.  It’s the solution we need. #debates,2020-10-08 02:00:50,Twitter for iPhone,19,54
Lots of talk about the Green New Deal but punitive measures like this don’t work. We need market-based solutions like the Trillion Trees Act to incentivize conservation and sustainability.
