“People on opposing teams didn’t like it when I ran right over them either. But that’s how you get the job done.” Great job @HerschelWalker @GOPconvention https://t.co/EcjDpwivtx,2020-08-25 01:38:49,Twitter for iPhone,9,39
What a misleading &amp; poorly written opinion! The only partisan congressional or leg. districts ever drawn in AR were drawn by Dems. Republicans have never drawn the lines yet have super majorities in the legislature &amp; hold all federal offices. #sorelosers  https://t.co/kHutghxpqL,2020-07-10 17:46:33,Twitter for iPhone,7,3
Still lots of empty gates at #ATL but most activity in the airports I’ve seen during the pandemic. Essential airline workers are still on the job. Congress should be too. @SpeakerPelosi https://t.co/HIvpmcl4no,2020-05-29 14:22:48,Twitter for iPhone,2,0
Today House Dems tossed the Constitution and cast proxy votes for the first time in the 231-year history of the House.  We must uphold the Constitution. That’s why I joined the lawsuit against Pelosi. https://t.co/6fDJFpE3kO,2020-05-28 02:21:37,Twitter for iPad,2,1
In 2016 Democrats broke House rules by staging a sit-in and streaming video from the House floor. It was appalling to me but didn’t seem to bother them to toss out over 200 years of decorum  during their temper tantrum. https://t.co/Eqe3kKfHZp,2020-05-28 02:20:29,Twitter for iPad,1,3
