I'm honored to have the opportunity to continue serving the Inland Empire in Congress and grateful for all the support that made this win possible.

.@JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris get it. They see the strain being placed on working families and they have a plan to get through this crisis and build back better. That’s why we have to keep working to get left the Biden-Harris ticket on November 3. https://t.co/o73c0K3xcV,2020-10-21 14:46:08,Twitter for iPhone,4,4

Proud to stand alongside our frontline workers to call upon @realDonaldTrump and Postmaster General DeJoy to put politics aside and finally fund the #PostOffice. Our safety and the fairness of our elections depends on it. https://t.co/JagPt8UM2R @RedlandsNews @sbsun,2020-08-21 16:36:40,Twitter Web App,1,1

We need a leader who will unite us.  We need a leader who will fight for systemic change.  We need a leader who cares about our country more than himself.  @JoeBiden is that leader. https://t.co/8S9ntUWOuo,2020-06-02 20:35:07,Twitter for iPhone,0,1
Speaker @TeamPelosi came to Congress to chew bubble gum and kick ass and she’s been out of bubble gum for a while.   Happy birthday Madam Speaker. https://t.co/6aFfHQulH2,2020-03-27 01:53:31,Twitter for iPhone,179,1254
Standing up against some of the biggest threats facing our community – like gun violence and climate change – is not about party politics. It’s about working together.  We need a president who has a record of getting big things done. That’s why I’m endorsing @MikeBloomberg. https://t.co/8YRFFheYmb,2020-02-21 00:58:56,Twitter for iPhone,1,3
