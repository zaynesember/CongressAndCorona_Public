The Lily Ledbetter Act  - signed 11 years ago today - was a major step toward economic justice and eliminating the gender pay gap. But the fight to #CloseTheGap – especially for women of color – isn’t over. The Senate must pass the #PaycheckFairness Act to end this inequity.,2020-01-29 21:23:00,TweetDeck,4,9
For rural New Mexico broadband expansion will bolster education opportunities and help address the crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls.

Let’s be clear: The Trump administration’s failed #RemainInMexico policy – like the rest of their anti-immigrant policies – is making the humanitarian crisis worse.   On President Trump’s watch children and families are suffering and basic human rights are systemically violated. https://t.co/6DpO3GWAP3,2020-01-29 20:01:06,Twitter Web App,47,90

Pres. Trump’s new anti-immigrant rule will disenfranchise low-income communities &amp; make families including those with children with citizenship status lose critical services for fear of risking green card &amp; citizenship eligibility.  I stand with immigrants against these attacks https://t.co/0KmuN6PSev,2020-01-27 23:08:26,Twitter Web App,24,52

President Trump’s Muslim Ban remains an affront to our American values.   Since the announcement of this immoral travel ban three years ago the Trump administration has continued to demonize Muslim communities. We cannot let this stand.,2020-01-27 19:29:14,Twitter for iPhone,13,34

President Trump will always side with special interests over the health and safety of our families.   By rolling back crucial environmental protections the president is jeopardizing New Mexico’s rivers and arroyos that we depend on for clean water.    https://t.co/pVbJOvx8nQ,2020-01-23 20:37:00,TweetDeck,34,59

Roe v. Wade established the right to safe and legal abortion and the right of all women to make their own choices about their health.   Today on the anniversary of this decision we must continue to protect Roe from the GOP’s relentless attempts to roll back the rights of women. https://t.co/B2FTL1vEFu,2020-01-22 16:32:21,Twitter Web App,10,26

Ten years ago the Supreme Court opened the floodgates of dark money in our politics.   We must #EndCitizensUnited for the American people — that’s why @HouseDemocrats passed #HR1 to bolster transparency in elections and #GetMoneyOut. https://t.co/va7U3yfhuM,2020-01-21 18:55:59,Twitter Web App,16,29
