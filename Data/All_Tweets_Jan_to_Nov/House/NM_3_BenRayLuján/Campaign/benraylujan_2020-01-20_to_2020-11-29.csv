I’m glad to hear that the Trump administration is finally beginning the presidential transition after weeks of delay. @JoeBiden won the 2020 election with a clear margin of victory and the American people deserve a smooth transition of power. https://t.co/PmApdUc0sI,2020-11-24 03:45:12,Twitter for iPhone,6,78

Your ballot is safe and secure — and every vote counts. https://t.co/CFhiotGSEe,2020-11-22 21:39:23,Twitter Web App,15,58
I ran for Senate because I was sick and tired of watching the Senate GOP fight to make life harder for working people.  COVID-19 has shown how important it is for every family to have high-quality affordable health care. When I'm in the Senate that will be my priority on Day 1.,2020-11-21 21:45:26,Twitter Web App,9,118
Let me be clear: New Mexico's elections were safe and secure thanks to the efforts of elections officials &amp; poll workers.  Efforts to cast doubt on our elections are baseless &amp; wrong — and they distract from the smooth transfer of power Americans deserve.  https://t.co/mlgdo6lvOC,2020-11-20 22:51:58,Twitter Web App,11,68
Happy Birthday @JoeBiden! Thank you for your lifetime of service to our country and your commitment to unifying our nation and building a strong future for all our families. https://t.co/zmMJ3Mno6r,2020-11-20 19:33:34,Twitter Web App,5,58

Across America Native voters played a key role in winning close races and electing @JoeBiden.  The Native vote is powerful — and the Senate has a clear mandate to strengthen tribal sovereignty and build a better future for all working families.  https://t.co/gpamSXjqiu,2020-11-18 20:56:20,Twitter Web App,3,24
New Mexicans should not have to live in fear that their health care will be stripped away during a pandemic.  Republicans must stop their destructive efforts to damage the ACA and come to the table for common-sense progress on health care — now.  https://t.co/JYT8SUSC0W,2020-11-17 23:15:35,Twitter Web App,5,29

President Trump's tax scam made it easier for companies to outsource American jobs &amp; delivered huge benefits to foreign investors.  @MarkRonchettiNM said that plan didn't go far enough for corporations.

Let's get the facts straight. I don't support guaranteed salaries for those unwilling to work and I never have.   My Mom and Dad raised me to work hard.

I'm fighting for a better health care system because no family should have to choose between seeing a doctor and putting food on the table.  @MarkRonchettiNM's plan would raise premiums &amp; end protections for pre-existing conditions. That's wrong — especially during a pandemic. https://t.co/ivbHTaaMhx,2020-10-20 17:45:18,Twitter Media Studio,16,29
On health care the choice is clear:   I fought to create protections for pre-existing conditions &amp; I'll keep working until everyone has high-quality care.   @MarkRonchettiNM would overturn our health care laws &amp; strip insurance from 245000 New Mexicans.  https://t.co/inmBaxzKRb,2020-10-20 00:24:54,Twitter Web App,18,45

I worked to secure $136 million for New Mexico’s law enforcement because I believe every family deserves to feel safe in their communities.   @MarkRonchettiNM talks a big game about supporting law enforcement — but only one of us has fought to make our streets safer. #nmpol,2020-10-19 00:58:44,Twitter Web App,17,58

The GOP's health care plan would: ❌ Increase premiums for millions ❌ Eliminate protections for pre-existing conditions ❌ Put an age tax on seniors   That's the plan @MarkRonchettiNM would have voted for in the Senate — and it's the opposite of what we need. #NMpol #NMSenDebate https://t.co/JdLGccNN7N,2020-10-19 00:19:07,Twitter Media Studio,21,30

Instead of voting on a #COVID19 relief package to help working families Senate Republicans are holding the second day of hearings for a #SCOTUS nominee who would strip health care from 245000 New Mexicans.

By staying silent after President Trump’s despicable comments about the military Mark Ronchetti has demonstrated that he values party loyalty more than he values our troops.    New Mexicans deserve better than that. (4/4).,2020-09-06 19:08:57,Twitter Web App,11,26

Why won’t @MarkRonchettiNM stand by New Mexico’s service members?  3 days have passed since journalists from the Atlantic &amp; Fox News reported that President Trump called troops who died in combat "losers" &amp; "suckers" and tried to keep wounded vets out of military parades.

New Mexico's school districts have worked hard to provide meals throughout #COVID19 &amp; I'm grateful for their efforts.  But they can't do it alone. The #HEROESAct includes billions for child nutrition because keeping kids fed should always be a top priority https://t.co/fLFwANxdKA,2020-08-09 21:46:05,Twitter Web App,10,21
President Trump’s payroll tax plan means the destruction of Medicare and Social Security.  New Mexicans have paid into these programs for years and deserve to know they’ll be there when we retire. Instead President Trump is willing to sacrifice our future for political points. https://t.co/vDILsvL2IR,2020-08-09 15:54:50,Twitter for iPhone,16,30
On Monday we celebrated the legacy of Miguel Trujillo a champion for equal rights who challenged bigoted laws &amp; won the right to vote for Native Americans.

Americans deserve better — and when we win back the Senate and the White House Democrats will lead the charge to restore the protections of the VRA and ensure that every eligible voter can cast their ballot.  Democracy is strongest when everyone's voice is heard. (7/7),2020-08-06 23:51:18,Twitter Web App,3,6
Over the past decades Democrats have fought to restore the VRA &amp; expand the wins of the civil rights movement.  Instead of joining us too many Republicans have worked to undermine voting rights &amp; increase barriers to the ballot box for historically disenfranchised voters. (6/7),2020-08-06 23:51:17,Twitter Web App,2,6
In New Mexico we’ve taken the opposite path — expanding same-day voter registration and automatic voter registration to make it easier for people to cast their ballot.  Here's the bottom line: Elections matter. (5/7),2020-08-06 23:51:17,Twitter Web App,0,7
Since the Supreme Court’s devastating decision more than a half-dozen states across the country have passed laws to restrict voting rights and make it harder for voters of color to make their voices heard in our election (4/7),2020-08-06 23:51:17,Twitter Web App,0,3
In 2013 five conservative Supreme Court judges ruled against common sense and struck down provisions of the Voting Rights Act that protected voters in areas of the country where voter discrimination had been rampant. (3/7),2020-08-06 23:51:17,Twitter Web App,0,3
When the VRA passed civil rights advocates knew the fight wasn’t over. For decades after Congress and the courts agreed with them &amp; the VRA was expanded 5 times to increase its protections.  But in recent years the Supreme Court has turned back the clock on civil rights. (2/7),2020-08-06 23:51:16,Twitter Web App,0,3
55 years ago today thanks to John Lewis and fellow civil rights leaders the Voting Rights Act — landmark legislation that prohibited racial discrimination in voting — was signed into law. (1/7),2020-08-06 23:51:16,Twitter Web App,15,29
For many New Mexicans a diagnosis like my Dad’s could mean choosing between quality health care &amp; paying the bills.  No one should have to make that choice.

Under legislation I just passed through the House communities around Abiquiú Lake could have more water for farming recreation &amp; sustainability.

Mitch McConnell's plan to slash fed. unemployment insurance would be an act of cruelty against millions of Americans who have lost their jobs during #COVID19.  The Senate must pass the #HEROESAct &amp; extend the $600/week payments now. NM families can't wait. https://t.co/ZnBSoNIJFK,2020-08-04 19:59:47,Twitter Web App,9,13
When my dad was battling lung cancer he was lucky to have insurance. But for many a cancer diagnosis means bankruptcy or worse.

Today we mourn the 23 lives taken one year ago during the El Paso Walmart shooting.  Hatred and xenophobia are deadly forces that must be stopped at every turn.

Voting is a fundamental right — &amp; thanks to advocates like Miguel Trujillo we've moved closer to making that right a reality for all.  But our work is far from finished.

In 2018 I introduced the Native American Voting Rights Act a bill that would:  ✅Increase polling site accessibility  ✅Expand bilingual ballot access ✅Validate tribal IDs for voting and voter registration ✅Ensure an equal right to vote for Native Americans (3/4),2020-08-03 17:00:27,Twitter Web App,5,7
Democracy demands that every eligible voter be able to register and cast their ballots easily without onerous barriers.  But for generations Native Americans have been systematically denied this right. That's unacceptable. (2/4),2020-08-03 17:00:27,Twitter Web App,2,3
Today on #MiguelTrujilloDay we celebrate the hard work of Native American voting rights activists who have fought tirelessly to secure the equal right to vote. (1/4) https://t.co/xVhjsaSOPh,2020-08-03 17:00:26,Twitter Web App,9,15

The #CARESAct was an important 1st step against #COVID19 but many small communities &amp; businesses didn't get the help they need.

For the last ten weeks McConnell has refused to allow a vote on the #HEROESAct which would extend federal unemployment benefits.   Now we're down to the wire. Unless the Senate acts by 7/31 the extra $600/week families currently receive will expire.,2020-07-23 22:18:00,Twitter Web App,5,9
10 weeks ago I fought to pass a House extension of fed. unemployment insurance for tens of millions of Americans out of work due to #COVID19.

John Lewis has often been described as the conscience of the Congress.  But truly he was the conscience of the country.  Rest in peace my friend and mentor.

These comments are racist and offensive.  Hispanics are disproportionately represented among the essential workers keeping our country going and are paying the price by suffering from #COVID19 at greater rates.

(6/8),2020-05-18 16:26:21,Twitter Web App,4,12
Dr. Bright testified that his superiors pushed him to make hydroxychloroquine widely available even without proof that the drug was safe or effective for #COVID19 treatment. (5/8)  https://t.co/4BPuzvxGTi,2020-05-18 16:26:21,Twitter Web App,5,14
I asked Dr. Bright if President Trump spoke accurately when he said that hydroxychloroquine was a safe treatment for #COVID19.   Dr. Bright said no. (4/8),2020-05-18 16:26:20,Twitter Web App,4,13
On Thursday I asked Dr. Bright if President Trump spoke accurately when he said — in a nationally-televised press conference — that hydroxychloroquine showed “very encouraging early results.”  Dr. Bright said no. (3/8),2020-05-18 16:26:20,Twitter Web App,2,10
When President Trump began promoting hydroxychloroquine in March scientific experts agreed that the drug needed more testing before it was recommended as a treatment for #COVID19. (2/8)  https://t.co/dLlIZxhbVI,2020-05-18 16:26:20,Twitter Web App,3,7
For weeks President Trump has promoted the unproven use of hydroxychloroquine to treat #COVID19.  On Thursday I questioned Dr. Rick Bright a former public health official.
