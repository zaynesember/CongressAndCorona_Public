GOP plan should be:  Every single elected Republican from  .@realDonaldTrump to USCongress down to every last state assemblyman needs to use twitter &amp; FB to link to #NYPost #BidenCorruption story.   Dare #BigTech to take down all those GOP accounts!!  @GOPLeader,2020-10-19 03:09:31,Twitter for iPhone,162,612
Hey Wisconsin crazy  @SarahKSilverman is helping Biden “laugh his way to the WH”. Funny how she only cares about WI 3 weeks before election. If conservatives turn out on vote Nov 3rd we’ll be the ones laughing as we send Biden back to his basement &amp; Silverman back to Hollywood! https://t.co/ZATxuOGztq,2020-10-18 15:38:26,Twitter for iPhone,32,115

#FB #twitter suppression of legit #NYPost story about #HunterBiden is a seminal moment in US history. If they get away with it it will be the end of free speech &amp; expression in USA.

From The Kitchen Table: Rachel &amp; I take on the abuse Judge Amy Coney Barrett is taking from the Left &amp; how it will backfire on Democrats AND we discuss the Presidential debate on Tuesday.

Catholics praying around  statue of St. Louis beaten by BLM mob. Not a good look for Dems who need to win the critical Catholic vote.
