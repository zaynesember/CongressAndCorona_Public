Glad to have had the opportunity to welcome Dominican leaders from Rhode Island alongside @SenJackReed @SenWhitehouse &amp; @davidcicilline.

President Trump put his own personal and political interest above the nation. He betrayed his oath of office. However instead of conducting an impartial trial and hearing the testimony of witnesses Senate Republicans abdicated their responsibility to the American people. https://t.co/6TWP7tUptx,2020-02-05 22:44:00,Twitter Web App,12,25
Rhode Island has so much to offer visitors including world-class hotels such as @WeekapaugInn and @OceanHouseRI in #Westerly which were recently recognized by @usnews. https://t.co/E49DxVUC5J,2020-02-05 18:00:50,Twitter Web App,1,0
The #SOTU is a uniquely American institution grounded in our Constitution &amp; I respect the President’s accepting Congress’s invitation to fulfill his duty. However the night was also a somber occasion. Full statement: https://t.co/RLukTpUhyM,2020-02-05 17:40:42,Twitter Web App,1,2
One of my chief priorities in Congress has been to ensure that workers have the skills to succeed. My #SOTU2020 guest @TacoComfort’s John White has played an important role in strengthening #RI's manufacturing industry w/ employee education &amp; training https://t.co/OhiRpGxsou,2020-02-05 01:21:15,Twitter for iPhone,2,2
What an honor to have the opportunity to share some of my thoughts on #cybersecurity w/ @NavalAcademy midshipmen! @USNAcyber has done pioneering work to develop its Cyber Operations major and I was floored by the talent and dedication of the young service members I met. https://t.co/kFcFkTwliw,2020-02-04 20:26:49,Twitter for iPhone,3,15

President Trump has banned travelers from six additional countries but he still has no real immigration strategy. Instead he continues to push inefficient divisive policies that like his border wall are not supported by actual intelligence. https://t.co/LykOTeIBjh,2020-02-01 00:33:31,Twitter for iPhone,2,9
Innovation is a part of Rhode Island’s DNA. I had a close look at the incredible camera systems being worked on at the veteran-owned Night Vision Technology Solutions in #Jamestown. https://t.co/tIMTZlblhw,2020-01-31 21:18:25,Twitter for iPhone,2,3

ICYMI: The credit reporting system that many rely on to buy a home/car or get a job is broken. With #HR3621 Congress took a step to make the system fair &amp; accurate b/c too many consumers feel like they are at the whim of agencies that are too big to care https://t.co/8dbN8K9BNr,2020-01-30 19:31:30,Twitter Web App,1,3
Mentors offer encouragement &amp; support that help keep youth on a path to success. Representatives from @MentoringRI &amp; @Bigs_RI stopped by my office yesterday to highlight #NationalMentoringMonth and discuss how we can continue to build these important relationships. https://t.co/t3tUkId6la,2020-01-30 18:28:44,Twitter Web App,1,5
I supported the #NeverAgainEducationAct to educate the next generation about the heartbreaking tragedies of the Holocaust.

Credit reports with inaccurate/adverse info can prevent someone from getting a job or taking out a mortgage - yet credit reporting agencies make it difficult to dispute. The Comprehensive CREDIT Act will provide long-overdue reforms to a broken system. https://t.co/tQMt5LrDVE,2020-01-29 21:44:03,Twitter Web App,1,4
School counselors play an important role in supporting students in their educational journeys. It was great to speak to @ASCAtweets about ways Congress can better support them including through passage of the Counseling for Career Choice Act I introduced w/ @CongressmanGT. https://t.co/wcjByKY0FS,2020-01-29 19:51:19,Twitter for iPhone,13,61
The Internet was not created with security in mind and in a world that is more interconnected each day critical systems to deliver essentials like water &amp; power are at risk. Subpoena authority allows @CISAgov to say something when they see something. https://t.co/BayjMliVLk,2020-01-29 19:03:28,Twitter Web App,2,11
I’m on the House floor getting ready to speak in support of the Comprehensive CREDIT Act a reform package that will improve accountability of credit reporting agencies &amp; better protect consumers from fraud and abusive lending.

.@USDA's #SNAP rule would take food away from 700000 vulnerable Americans. Many recipients are either attempting to find work or face hardships that prevent them from doing so. Sadly this Administration would rather demonize them than help #HandsOffSNAP https://t.co/c1CvQa6C1E,2020-01-28 23:46:21,Twitter Web App,5,7

Older Americans should not have to foot the bill for the disastrous #GOP tax law. It’s shameful to target essential programs like #Medicare that people rely on to cover Trump’s deficits. https://t.co/Pi5MjspJuD,2020-01-26 18:34:53,Twitter for iPhone,6,5
Congratulations to the changemakers recognized @RWULaw's #ChampionsofJustice reception. #RI is stronger because of your steadfast commitment to ensuring equality fairness and opportunity for all.,2020-01-25 01:42:24,Twitter for iPhone,1,3

10 years ago the Supreme Court issued its disastrous #CitizensUnited decision that opened the floodgates of dark money in politics.

#MLK believed that life's most persistent &amp; urgent question is: "What are you doing for others?" As we celebrate his life and tremendous impact at Ebenezer Baptist Church I keep in mind that it is through service &amp; comradeship that we will continue to build a stronger society. https://t.co/z4thUitRqd,2020-01-20 22:55:26,Twitter for iPhone,4,12
It's "a day on not a day off" for the volunteers who've rolled their sleeves up to make improvements at @324Hope in honor of #MLK 's legacy.
