I'm thankful that @GOPLeader is focused on the growing threat from China. In addition to covering up the spread of #COVID19 they led a propaganda effort to blame the U.S. &amp; are quickly militarizing the South China Sea.

This is outrageous! Volunteers who have gone to NY to help fight the #COVID19 pandemic should not have to pay NY state taxes. @realDonaldTrump is correct we should not bailout states that continue to have bloated out of control budgets.  https://t.co/NAdIRw0ia0,2020-05-06 18:45:58,Twitter Web App,29,45

Regardless of what Democrats and their media allies say the second allocation of #PPP has processed 2.2 million loans with an average loan size of $79000. This is another indicator that the program is assisting our struggling small businesses and not large corporations.,2020-05-04 19:22:17,Twitter Web App,7,26

If Pelosi truly wanted bipartisan oversight of the #COVID__19 response she would not have put Maxine Waters on the committee.

The select committee on the #COVID19 response is yet another political hitjob on @realDonaldTrump. This committee would be led by Rep.

Instead of providing additional funds for the Paycheck Protection Program when @realDonaldTrump requested Speaker Pelosi put politics over people and delayed the program an additional two weeks.

Last week Speaker Pelosi stated that there was “no data” to prove small businesses need more funds from the #PaycheckProtectionProgram. Senate Dems then blocked additional funding and today due to their negligence the program has run out of funds.,2020-04-16 19:22:52,Twitter Web App,32,49
Pelosi and Schumer have allowed the #PaycheckProtectionProgram to run out of money. I'm astounded that Democrats would play partisan games while everyday Americans are struggling. We must increase funding for the PPP immediately.,2020-04-16 16:15:54,Twitter Web App,64,241
Despite the significant demand for this program the #PaycheckProtectionProgram is scheduled to run out of money this week. Speaker Pelosi and Leader Schumer continue to block more funding for this program that is providing emergency relief to the American people.,2020-04-15 20:35:13,Twitter Web App,63,117
In Colorado over 28000 loans have been approved totaling over $5.8 billion dollars from the #PaycheckProtectionProgram. Pelosi and Schumer must quit their partisan games and deliver more funds to help save our small businesses and their employees.,2020-04-15 17:25:22,Twitter Web App,27,85

Democrats should be ashamed that they continue blocking additional job-saving funding. We must pass a clean bill allocating more funds to the #PaycheckProtectionProgram.

January Recap:  @realDonaldTrump  -Signed #USMCA into law  -Signed trade deal with China -Introduced a Middle East peace plan -Eliminated terrorists    Dems -Complain about lack of witnesses while also stating that there is overwhelming evidence to impeach @POTUS,2020-02-03 22:18:51,Twitter Web App,47,199
Americans are tired of hearing from Shifty Schiff &amp; Nervous Nadler. Dems would drag this out until the 2020 election if they could. Thankfully @senatemajldr stood firm and didn’t cave to the Dems who couldn’t make their case in the House. @realDonaldTrump will be exonerated.,2020-01-31 23:59:10,Twitter for iPhone,67,208
The vote is in. The Senate does not want to extend the farce against @realDonaldTrump any longer. It is past time to move on. #Shampeachment,2020-01-31 22:44:58,Twitter Web App,98,415
Furthermore impeachment should never be based on pure hatred. We were warned about this exact style of hyperpartisan impeachment by our Founding Fathers. @realDonaldTrump has continued to prioritize the needs of the American people. Dems prefer a witch-hunt #Shampeachment.,2020-01-31 22:26:22,Twitter Web App,84,210
The only compelling &amp; overwhelming evidence is that @realDonaldTrump did not commit any impeachable offense. The only bipartisan vote was against impeachment. Five impeachment managers voted to impeach @POTUS before the Ukraine call. This is a targeted hit-job. #ShamImpeachment,2020-01-31 22:02:01,Twitter Web App,85,187
It is not the Senate's job to fix a shoddy House investigation. It's time to move on and end the charade. House Dems had 18 witnesses Republicans had zero. They weren't able to prove their case. This is over @realDonaldTrump will be fully exonerated.,2020-01-31 21:53:30,Twitter Web App,908,2399

Schiff's alternate made-up scenario is not only false but it's completely idiotic. @realDonaldTrump did not ask for Zelensky to do "me" a favor he said US (the United States). @POTUS also did not threaten aid on the call.

Dems failed to provide due process for @POTUS &amp; weaponized the most important constitutional process. They're trying to strongarm the Senate after a failed House investigation. https://t.co/T2eVSkpwuT,2020-01-21 21:56:35,Twitter Web App,49,150
Democrats can't contain their glee over impeaching @POTUS. Their actions and cheers speak louder than their hollow poll-tested words. Dems have called for impeachment since day one because they are consumed by their complete hatred of @realDonaldTrump. #shampeachment https://t.co/29z0KRkZXl,2020-01-21 19:16:06,Twitter Web App,89,314
