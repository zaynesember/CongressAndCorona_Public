In 2019 Texas produced more energy from wind than coal.  As wind and solar power continue to grow we also see that building renewable energy sources are not only good for the environment but are also less costly than traditional energy sources.  https://t.co/LhBRpfRhAO,2020-01-23 19:46:41,Twitter Web Client,5,12

Russia continues to threaten and attempt to meddle in our institutions and progress as a nation. Their behavior reinforces the importance of our strong alliances like NATO in order to stand up to Russian and collectively protect our common interests. https://t.co/DV7aCpnU4X,2020-01-22 17:15:24,Twitter Web Client,7,7

@callerdotcom @POTUS' reckless diversion of military funds to build his wall harms the Texas 34th and the brave men and women of our armed forces. Ignoring $116 billion of unfunded military construction work ultimately hurts the readiness security and quality of life for our military.,2020-01-21 18:45:28,Twitter Web App,0,2
It is especially important for me to bring these pinning ceremonies to my district "mainly because our Vietnam War veterans weren't honored back then. It's taken us a long time to show them that we appreciate what they did." https://t.co/a7Lsptx1Wl via @KRBNNews,2020-01-21 18:42:47,Twitter Web Client,1,3

Let me be clear: The funds sought by @POTUS would rob from the schools &amp; housing that military families depend on; the hangars that protect aircraft &amp; vehicles; the security mechanisms that keep our bases safe; &amp; the infrastructure that allows us to be ready for the future fight.,2020-01-21 18:31:49,Twitter Web App,1,3
On a recent visit to Naval Air Stations Kingsville and Corpus Christi two bases critical in training our Navy and Marine Corps aviators of the future the facilities were not only crumbling around our aircraft but also — and most importantly — around our military personnel.,2020-01-21 18:31:49,Twitter Web App,0,1
I have seen firsthand how this diversion of critical funds would negatively impact urgent infrastructure projects at our military installations.,2020-01-21 18:31:48,Twitter Web App,0,0
@DeptofDefense’s approval of this massive transfer would have a direct and negative impact on our defense installations and readiness nationwide.,2020-01-21 18:31:48,Twitter Web App,0,0
@POTUS' latest call to siphon $7.2 billion from our Defense Department’s military construction and counter-drug budgets to fund his border wall is yet another attempt by this administration to harm our military to pay for its political agenda.,2020-01-21 18:31:48,Twitter Web App,1,4

I am excited to read this novel written by one of the Rio Grande Valley's very own. "Throw" is the story of a young teen dealing with love loss and belonging. Tribulations I think everyone can relate to. https://t.co/MU7FJIQYxJ via @Valley Morning Star,2020-01-21 17:35:05,Twitter Web Client,2,9
