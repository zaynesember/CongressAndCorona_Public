Congress authorized military force in 2002 to remove Saddam Hussein in Iraq. That mission has long ended. Today I voted to repeal that #AUMF because I don't want the Trump Administration to misuse that legal authority to justify war with Iran. https://t.co/GenOrILla6,2020-01-30 19:03:43,Twitter Web App,7,35
Removing congressional offices from this facility would have created more barriers for veterans to receive constituent services.

I'm calling on House leadership to swiftly pass the NO BAN Act legislation that would allow us to protect our national security while staying true to our nation’s core values.

I will keep working on a bipartisan basis to ensure that Congress swiftly provides Puerto Rico with the resources it requires to recover and that aid reaches the American citizens who need it with full accountability and transparency (2/2).  #flapol #fl07,2020-01-21 17:43:50,Twitter for iPhone,0,10
The people of #PuertoRico &amp; federal taxpayers are right to be angry &amp;  disappointed about unused emergency supplies found in a warehouse.
