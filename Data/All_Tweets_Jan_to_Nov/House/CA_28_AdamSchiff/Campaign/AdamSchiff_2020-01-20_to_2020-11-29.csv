It’s been 3 weeks since Election Day and I wanted to sit down and share some initial thoughts.  The first goal was defeating Donald Trump. And we did it. Now we can begin to repair the damage.

Donald Trump’s promise to eliminate the payroll tax is a promise to bankrupt Social Security.  In three years.  Not surprising for a man who managed to bankrupt a casino in a single year.  A casino where the house ALWAYS wins.  With Trump’s payroll scam seniors ALWAYS lose. https://t.co/fMu9asRX4L,2020-08-25 17:08:54,Twitter for iPhone,1297,2841

Trump's Postmaster General refuses to reverse his changes to the Postal Service.  Americans' access to essential food and medicine and our votes are still under threat.

Trump promises Americans that Mexico will pay for the wall.  They don’t. It is a lie. Taxpayers foot the bill.  Bannon promises donors all their money will pay for the wall.  It doesn’t.

In 2009 Obama and Biden saved a million auto industry jobs and created 250000 new ones.  In 2020 Trump called for a boycott of a U.S. tire manufacturer that employs 63000 in a state suffering double-digit unemployment because he got mad while watching Fox.  Vote for Joe. https://t.co/b7yEqwemoj,2020-08-20 02:10:59,Twitter Web App,583,2092
Trump’s Postmaster General has been sabotaging the postal system for months.  So his empty promises just don’t cut it.

The House is acting to save the Postal Service.  We will return to DC and hold hearings.  We will pass legislation to protect the mail and stop the cutbacks.

Trump and his hand-picked Postmaster are sabotaging the Postal Service. Right before the election.  Banning overtime cutting staff decommissioning mail-sorting machines and more.

It’s the 85th anniversary of Social Security.  A program to keep seniors veterans and the disabled out of poverty.  Trump campaigned on preserving it.

Trump has proposed executive orders on evictions and student loans that do nothing.  His payroll tax plan reduces funding for Social Security and Medicare.

Trump has been unable to explain his second term agenda but yesterday he finally gave us a preview.  He says he wants to eliminate payroll taxes which pays for 90 percent of Social Security.

The power to pardon can be used to right a wrong give people a second chance or provide leniency when it's deserved.

For all the families who have been touched by our justice system  Roger Stone’s commutation is a slap in the face.  It’s not about legal and illegal or right and wrong.

Trump has engaged in countless abuses of his office.  But commuting Roger Stone’s sentence after he lied to Congress to cover up for Trump is a new low.

In the two weeks since the GOP Senate refused to hold Trump accountable he has:  —Intervened in the sentencing of his accomplice —Called for prosecution of his “enemies” —Punished those who spoke out out —Fired the DNI for briefing Congress   Are they proud of their vote now?,2020-02-23 16:59:17,Twitter for iPhone,14881,44851
Mick Mulvaney is saying the quiet part out loud:  GOP was only concerned about deficits because Obama was President.  That concern has disappeared under Trump.  Easy to adjust your principles when they were never sincere in the first place. https://t.co/fhwDUFgtjy,2020-02-21 00:53:24,Twitter Web App,1154,4035
In 2018 Florida voters overwhelmingly passed a referendum to re-enfranchise 1.6 million ex-felons who served their time.  The governor and the legislature are trying to nullify that vote.  Now a federal appeals court says it's unconstitutional.  Not to mention unconscionable. https://t.co/c79hOxMri3,2020-02-20 16:45:26,Twitter for iPhone,537,1956
Pardons can be used to right a wrong or show mercy to the repentant.  Instead Trump pardons Fox News guests the wealthy and well-connected  And those convicted of the same serious crimes his associates are accused of.  It’s unjust at best. Corrupt at worst.,2020-02-19 21:31:31,Twitter Web App,4989,19770

We have seen the devastating cost of a president without fundamental decency in our government.  But it goes beyond that.  Children are learning from his example and using his rhetoric.  Yet one more reason why decency matters. https://t.co/2ymgr462Zb,2020-02-15 16:00:57,Twitter for iPhone,3060,10613
Trump is attacking the independence of our justice system.  He's attacking anyone independent enough to disagree with him.  The fact that his latest abuses are taking place out in the open makes them all the more insidious.  This is a wholesale assault on the rule of law. https://t.co/4cUqMuoRxp,2020-02-14 20:51:13,Twitter Web App,2440,8010
Senate Republicans have blocked three critical election security bills. Again.  That make voting machines harder to hack.  And require illegal foreign interference to be reported to authorities.  All blocked.  Americans want to know: why won’t the GOP protect our elections?,2020-02-13 03:19:57,Twitter for iPhone,18672,51316
Trump promised not to touch Social Security Medicare or Medicaid.  His budget cuts them all.  It also cuts affordable housing education and the EPA.  Promises made. Promises broken. https://t.co/4nKpD1nRJY,2020-02-11 02:24:15,Twitter Web App,4619,11523
We did our constitutional duty and upheld our oath even as many Senators did not.   They declined to hear from witnesses and refused to convict even as they admitted the case against the President was proven.  The voters will hold them and the President accountable. https://t.co/YOgq7Wj1jy,2020-02-09 17:44:56,TweetDeck,4103,17337
We still don’t know how much Trump is profiting at taxpayers’ expense. He refuses to tell us.  But with $650 a night hotel bills we know it’s a lot.  Americans deserve to know what the President is charging the American people for his vacations. https://t.co/3nxrZnTKLF,2020-02-08 16:05:09,Twitter for iPhone,9627,28799
At the State of the Union Trump asked the House to pass a bill to lower the cost of prescription drugs.  That’s good.  The only problem? We already did. And he threatened to veto it. https://t.co/NFWFD2EAj0,2020-02-06 17:59:27,Twitter for iPhone,4567,11083
We have impeachment for a reason:  For a man who would sell out his country for a political favor  Who would threaten the integrity of our elections  Who would invite foreign interference in our affairs  Who would undermine our national security  For a man like Donald Trump.,2020-02-03 23:05:40,Twitter for iPhone,15988,62454
It’s enormously important that the country understand exactly what the President did.  When he sought to coerce an ally into helping him cheat in the next election. And that he’s at it still.  We have proved our case. The Senate should find him guilty and remove him from office. https://t.co/rhUpFfliPC,2020-02-02 22:56:19,Twitter for iPhone,5389,17771
There’s no basis to expand the travel ban except to block immigrants and refugees.  America has been a beacon for generations of immigrants from all around the world and they have helped build our nation.  This is discrimination pure and simple. We can’t let it stand. https://t.co/Z0QYq6c2r0,2020-02-01 03:11:29,Twitter for iPhone,1341,5841
The Trump Administration's attack on health care continues this time with an effort to turn Medicaid into a block grant.  Medicaid block grants have been a far right dream for years.   If allowed to go into effect this will mean vulnerable Americans lose their health care. https://t.co/XnI19XrfXL,2020-01-30 23:58:35,Twitter for iPhone,973,2114
If Senators have more questions about the President's motives they can ask someone who has first hand knowledge:  They can call on John Bolton to testify. https://t.co/W1eDafzYZm,2020-01-30 14:39:10,Twitter for iPhone,1072,4780
An Arizona law making it harder for people to cast their ballot has been found to violate the Voting Rights Act.   It’s an important victory in the fight against voter suppression.  Every eligible voter should be able to cast a ballot. It’s that simple. https://t.co/P2ay8HQWt2,2020-01-29 01:19:46,Twitter for iPhone,1397,5261
The President’s misconduct poses a particularly acute danger because it goes to the very heart of our democracy.  He sought to cheat in an election by soliciting foreign interference.  That’s why he was impeached and why he must be removed. https://t.co/vvfZ3xROnF,2020-01-27 01:23:31,Twitter Web App,3132,12983
We all knew this was coming.   After a massive tax cut for the wealthy that lead to trillion dollar deficits Trump now says it’s time to look at cuts to Social Security and Medicare.  Once again he wants working Americans to pay the bill for corporations and billionaires. https://t.co/D6kJAyscch,2020-01-23 15:43:05,Twitter for iPhone,10526,23653
Martin Luther King Jr. led the fight for racial equality and economic justice.  His strength and moral courage challenged us to live up to our ideals and inspired generations of new leaders.  Today and every day we commit to honoring his life and carrying on his legacy.,2020-01-20 22:33:03,Twitter for iPhone,372,2444
