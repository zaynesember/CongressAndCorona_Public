Donald Trump has repeatedly abused the pardon power to reward friends and protect those who covered up for him.  This time he pardons Michael Flynn who lied to hide his dealings with the Russians.

What happens when the bill comes due?  We know one thing: He always puts his interests above the nation’s. https://t.co/tXzkk7XADx,2020-09-29 21:05:27,Twitter for iPhone,2911,8047
This story deeply moved me.  No one's health care should suffer because of the color of their skin. No family should have to advocate for the humanity of their loved one as they await care.

Trump lives a life of luxury and lets working families pay the taxes.  The year he was elected he paid $750 in income taxes.  No wonder his signature policy is cutting taxes for the wealthy and cutting healthcare for everyone else.  It’s who Trump is.

COVID-19 cases are once again on the rise nationally.  Instead of acting to slow the spread Trump is taking $300 million from the CDC for an election season ad campaign.  On masks? No. Distancing?

Here's why Republicans are rushing Amy Coney Barrett into a lifetime appointment:  So she can strike down healthcare and overturn Roe v. Wade.

This is how democracy dies.  A president so desperate to cling to power that he won’t commit to a peaceful transition of power.  That he seeks to throw out millions of votes.

Trump misled the country in February when he downplayed the severity of the virus but told Bob Woodward that COVID-19 was deadly airborne and worse than any flu.

The Postmaster General must resign.  He’s slowed delivery banned overtime &amp; decommissioned mail-sorting machines.  Right before the election. During a pandemic.  The House must demand answers.

Trump’s promises aren’t worth the paper they’re written on.   First he was going to extend unemployment benefits.   Then he said he would cut them to $400.

More than 120000 Americans have died. Tens of millions are unemployed.   Families are witnessing their loved one’s last moments by FaceTime.

To the same extent that John Bolton indicts Trump for unfitness he indicts himself for cowardice and greed.  Col.

Trump asked Russia for help in his election. He coerced Ukraine.  And now according to Bolton Trump asked China too:  Begging President Xi to help his reelection in exchange for trade concessions.  No wonder he praised China's handling of COVID.  Congress must expose it all. https://t.co/COTlTZ2Etz,2020-06-21 16:13:37,Twitter Media Studio,5899,17166
Another Friday night another attempted massacre this time SDNY U.S. Attorney Berman.   Barr does Trump’s dirty work again.

Another Supreme Court decision worth celebrating (and I don’t say that very often):   The Trump Administration's decision to rescind DACA protections was cruel and callous — and now it is illegal.

Bolton’s staff were asked to testify before the House to Trump’s abuses and did. They had a lot to lose and showed real courage.  When Bolton was asked he refused and said he’d sue if subpoenaed.

Flynn pled guilty to lying to the FBI about his illicit Russian contacts.  His lies do not now become truths.  This dismissal does not exonerate him.  But it does incriminate Bill Barr.

Ahmaud Arbery just 25 years old was gunned down while jogging in his own neighborhood.  Despite the existence of a video neither attacker has been arrested or charged. An all-too familiar story.

To help here’s a valuable summary of where we are and what we know: https://t.co/wvGWpTXrpt,2020-03-26 13:56:53,Twitter for iPhone,7679,21457
First Trump fails to take Coronavirus seriously losing precious weeks.  Then claims he’s a wartime president and follows expert advice.  Now he's going weak at the knees watching Fox and debating deadly laxity.  Leaders make tough calls for the greater good.  Based on facts.,2020-03-24 17:27:48,Twitter Web App,19098,77979
The same guy who said “I alone can fix it”  And then said “I take no responsibility”  Now wants to be in charge of a $500 billion slush fund with the power to reward friends and punish enemies and says “I will be the oversight.”  My answer: “No you won’t.” https://t.co/8SKWPxxYBE,2020-03-24 01:03:25,Twitter for iPhone,35769,114235
Experts agree: Coronavirus can be stopped.  We need to listen to scientists and doctors. Practice rigorous social distancing. Restrict non-essential activity. Make tests widely available. Produce more ventilators and masks.  We can do this — and will — by working together. https://t.co/xdwNReNsOh,2020-03-23 18:41:32,Twitter Web App,6310,21170
We need to put families first not corporations.  A $500 billion slush fund where states have to compete with big businesses?  Controlled by Secretary Mnuchin with no oversight transparency or protections for taxpayers?  That should be unacceptable to everyone. https://t.co/BsJwjgOCy9,2020-03-23 13:55:24,Twitter Web App,18697,57072
We need to bring people together to fight Coronavirus.  Blaming China may seem like good politics but it doesn’t solve anything or mitigate the Trump Administration’s failures.  Calling it the “Chinese virus” only breeds disunity discrimination and division.  Enough already.,2020-03-21 23:17:40,Twitter for iPhone,16299,77397
Months ago I warned the Intelligence Community was being politicized by Trump.  Withholding testimony on climate and documents on Russia and Ukraine.   Purging community leadership and misleading on election interference.  This is dangerous. And just the way Trump wants it. https://t.co/qQuydzlkgR,2020-03-21 01:51:33,Twitter for iPhone,18244,48144
Congress is doing its job by providing emergency funding. But the president must do his.   Where are the tests? Where are the field hospitals? Where are the ventilators? Where are the masks?   We won’t be distracted by his baseless attacks on the press.,2020-03-20 21:02:54,Twitter for iPhone,27307,92964
A real president would answer:  We will tap into the immense talents of the American people to find effective treatments and a vaccine and produce all the ventilators and gear we need.  We’ll respect and care for each other even at a distance.  That‘s how we’ll get through this. https://t.co/IQM2IG3XQ5,2020-03-20 17:54:41,Twitter for iPhone,24728,84793
Last night California issued a mandatory statewide order to stay at home.  Essential services like health care groceries and banks will remain open.  The rest of us must do our part – now – to flatten the curve.  We will get through this as a community state and nation. https://t.co/PrAFu8lnWG,2020-03-20 15:08:54,Twitter Web App,2569,11066
Freelance contract and gig economy workers are being hit hard by the economic impacts of this pandemic.  Especially my constituents in the entertainment industry.  Many can’t qualify for unemployment or other benefits.  We are working to fix that in the next relief bill: https://t.co/Ny3qhPXEXV,2020-03-19 18:29:52,Twitter for iPhone,1900,6373
Our nurses doctors and hospital staff are telling us that they need more ventilators and protective gear. Now.  This isn't a future problem. There’s no time to delay.  The President must use every power to increase critical medical supply production. Lives are at stake. https://t.co/t5THjs8g8G,2020-03-19 14:28:41,Twitter for iPhone,10807,34903
Health care workers and hospital staff are our first line of defense against Coronavirus — and they’re telling us they don’t have sufficient supplies.   President Trump must use his authority under the Defense Production Act to address this critical medical supply shortage. https://t.co/d0uTarH6UU,2020-03-17 23:08:43,Twitter for iPhone,7996,22738
This brazen assault on the free press by the Chinese Communist Party is appalling.  That it occurred in the midst of a public health crisis when the flow of unbiased information to the public is critical is also dangerous.  China’s attempts to silence the truth must not stand. https://t.co/Sd6krWKysY,2020-03-17 20:17:34,Twitter for iPhone,7313,24630
The doctors nurses and other health care workers treating patients and keeping our hospitals &amp; clinics open are heroes.  To help we must do all we can to flatten the curve so they can care for the most at-risk patients.  Thinking of them as we do our part and keep our distance. https://t.co/d8ZrdYuvng,2020-03-17 14:59:42,Twitter for iPhone,3613,14622
We need an economic response to this crisis as well as a health response.  Let’s start by keeping it simple.  An immediate payment of $1000 for every adult. $500 for every kid.  This will help keep families afloat and businesses that depend on them.  We are all in this together.,2020-03-16 20:44:31,Twitter for iPad,22877,92827
I’m working (and tweeting) from home today. And will be for some time.  Not just because someone I know came down with the virus. But because it’s good for everyone.   Slowing the rate of infection means hospitals won’t be overwhelmed which saves lives.  Help flatten the curve. https://t.co/DYGThKBgPm,2020-03-15 20:04:30,Twitter for iPhone,13046,52799
Mr. President keep your focus on the current crisis. The delay in testing and your failure to lead are already costing us dearly.  Your attacks on the independence of the justice system and rewarding of cronies who lied for you can wait.  Incompetence kills. https://t.co/uebbLzWBtE,2020-03-15 18:34:04,Twitter for iPhone,21343,75076
I was informed that a former staffer who left our office 10 days ago has tested positive for COVID-19.  Although doctors believe the staffer contracted the virus after leaving my office I'm taking additional distancing precautions including postponing meetings and teleworking: https://t.co/EfwsDo1BZG,2020-03-15 15:40:08,Twitter for iPhone,5664,25503
The House passed legislation to respond to the health and economic crisis.  This is just a first step.  I represent thousands in the entertainment industry who have lost their jobs but may not qualify for unemployment insurance.  More will be needed for Americans everywhere.,2020-03-14 18:24:21,Twitter for iPad,4040,18716
The House just passed another bipartisan bill putting American families first as we respond to Coronavirus:  Coronavirus tests at no cost to all who need them. Paid sick leave expanded food security enhanced unemployment insurance and more.   We’re all in this together.,2020-03-14 04:58:46,Twitter for iPhone,15833,84665
Hundreds of constituents have contacted our office with questions about Coronavirus so I sat down with Dr. @RebeccaKatz5 a public health and infectious disease expert to get answers.

In any public health crisis time is precious.  We lost valuable weeks while the Administration was downplaying the seriousness of this now-pandemic instead of surging our capacity to test treat and slow the spread of Coronavirus.

No Mr. McCarthy nationality has no bearing on your likelihood of contracting or spreading the coronavirus.  Misinformation like that leads to discrimination against Asian-Americans.

Mr. President you are wrong. As usual.  Today’s briefing for all House Members focuses on the threat of foreign interference in our election.  The briefers are agency heads and senior officials. They are your own people.  We will insist on the truth whether you like it or not. https://t.co/bl4HUlPprj,2020-03-10 16:07:10,Twitter for iPhone,19790,71816
Any plan to address the economic impacts of Coronavirus must center on protecting American families and small businesses:  →Paid sick leave →Enhanced unemployment insurance →Low interest loans  →Expanded food security programs →Free accessible testing →Affordable treatment,2020-03-09 20:42:30,Twitter Web App,11050,39983
Staying home when you're sick shouldn't mean losing a paycheck—especially during a public health emergency.   The Coronavirus crisis has made it abundantly clear:  America needs guaranteed paid sick leave for all.

Notwithstanding Trump’s assault on the rule of law and democratic institutions the system can hold.  One reason why? The independence of the lower courts.

We all commend Mr. Rogers' patriotic commitment to voting.  But it shouldn't be this way.  Long lines form when states close polling locations to suppress the vote.

Elaine McCusker warned withholding military aid from Ukraine may violate the law. It did.

Trump is trying to roll back discrimination protections for LGBTQ people under the guise of religious liberty.

Trump’s lawyers convinced two judges of their unprecedented legal theory that courts CANNOT enforce congressional subpoenas.  This was after they argued during the impeachment trial that the House was REQUIRED to enforce subpoenas in court.

Managing pandemics requires trustworthy and accurate information.

Nice deflection Mr. President. But your false claims fool no one.  You welcomed Russian help in 2016 tried to coerce Ukraine’s help in 2019 and won’t protect our elections in 2020.

There are 175000 federal prisoners. Many are serving harsh sentences and deserve mercy.

Barr admits he intervened in the sentencing of a man who lied to Congress to cover up for the President.  He’s only upset that Trump’s tweets made the political nature of his intervention obvious.

After two and half centuries of our nation's history it's come to this:  The President's lawyers argue on the Senate floor that he can withhold aid coerce an ally and try to cheat in an election  And there's nothing we can do about it.  Our Founders would be aghast. https://t.co/3uHFnaY44q,2020-01-31 03:56:27,Twitter Media Studio,33916,119531
When we have a President who so egregiously abuses and corrupts his office unlike other countries we have a remedy:  Impeachment.  This trial is now part of our Constitutional heritage.   But if we refuse a fair trial it diminishes the example we set for the rest of world. https://t.co/0BgC9IaPZO,2020-01-31 00:06:46,Twitter Media Studio,16781,64441
Over the past week we've seen a descent into Constitutional madness.  The President and his team argue that any conduct is okay as long as a president thinks it will benefit him.  That's an argument of pure desperation — one you only make when you know your client is guilty. https://t.co/InfbVzjpd6,2020-01-30 20:53:45,Twitter Media Studio,20079,68002
We’ve seen a remarkable lowering of the bar.   According to Trump’s lawyers everything is okay as long as the president believes it helps his reelection.  It’s not okay to solicit foreign election interference even if you fail.   It just makes you a failed crook. https://t.co/jHm82CHyw0,2020-01-30 14:16:24,Twitter Media Studio,22718,80436
It's clear what the President's lawyers are saying:  If you want a fair trial we're going to make this endless. We're going to make this painful.   But a fair trial isn't a threat. It's a cornerstone of American democracy.  And you can't have a fair trial without basic fairness. https://t.co/eK43g4Fggc,2020-01-30 02:57:03,Twitter Media Studio,19725,74738
The idea that abuse of power isn’t impeachable would’ve terrified our Founders.  You can’t write off a consensus of Constitutional scholars by calling them “Never Trumpers”  Unless we're prepared to accept that Article II really does allow the President to do whatever he wants. https://t.co/hY5hBv9AJ4,2020-01-30 00:23:49,Twitter Media Studio,10515,35334
As Trump said they “have all the material.” And there’s a reason they won’t provide it.  The White House is blocking all witnesses and documents and Senators can infer why.  But Senators don't have to infer. They can demand to see it.  And they must. https://t.co/anKQH9CMoR,2020-01-29 23:42:19,Twitter Media Studio,15782,55390
The pattern of his words and conduct is clear: President Trump thinks he is above the law. He thinks he is the state.   Trump said it himself: Under Article II I can do whatever I want.   Precisely what our Founders feared. Precisely why they drafted the remedy of impeachment. https://t.co/9rOgTzfpUo,2020-01-29 20:57:14,Twitter Media Studio,18222,61905
Here are my takeaways:   Trump’s lawyers cannot and did not defend him on the facts.   Their defense has evolved to this: he did it so what?   His lawyers strengthened our case that the Senate must hear from Bolton.   A fair trial requires key witnesses. Will America have one?,2020-01-28 20:06:38,Twitter for iPhone,31537,123123
The President’s lawyers say this is about a “policy debate.”  It is not.  Unless that policy provides that a president can be as corrupt as he chooses and there is nothing Congress can do about it.  That must never be the policy of the United States.,2020-01-28 19:35:29,TweetDeck,17293,68186
Trump's defense boils down to this:  Sure the President did it.  We all know he did it.   We just don't want the American people to see even more evidence that he did it.  Besides he is allowed to do whatever he wants.  Get over it.  Well the American people know better. https://t.co/r92J8ILk20,2020-01-28 16:33:34,Twitter Media Studio,22881,76523
Trump has broken our nation’s promise to immigrants:  Give me your tired your poor your huddled masses yearning to be free.  Generations of immigrants have come to the U.S. with nothing and helped make our country great.  The American dream is always worth defending. https://t.co/lh0xEZ6UKz,2020-01-28 14:50:08,Twitter for iPhone,10098,36393
A few takeaways:  The President’s lawyers made the case for calling John Bolton falsely claiming the President never told anyone the aid was conditioned on investigations.   They don’t deny Trump sought foreign interference in 2020.  They smear the Bidens.  They have no defense.,2020-01-28 02:32:38,Twitter for iPhone,25840,109838
On Holocaust Remembrance Day we remember the six million Jews and other victims of Nazism.  We honor their memories by speaking out against anti-Semitism injustice and hatred in all forms. Never Again.,2020-01-27 16:14:10,Twitter Web App,10536,51179
We already have strong and direct evidence that Trump withheld military aid to demand political investigations.  Bolton further corroborates it.  Senators have taken an oath to be impartial. Don’t they want to hear the full truth?  Bolton must testify. https://t.co/UXl9b2x2ZX,2020-01-27 14:55:27,Twitter Media Studio,17999,65261
Facial recognition technology is racing ahead of privacy laws creating the potential for abuse by the government law enforcement corporations and bad actors.  This is an area crying out for Congressional oversight and action. https://t.co/ivSq0K6n4g,2020-01-27 02:39:39,Twitter Web App,5277,20956
There is nothing more important than family. Thinking of my friend and colleague @RepJerryNadler and his wife during this difficult time. His leadership has been crucial.  Jerry we’re keeping you and Joyce in our prayers as we continue our important work together. https://t.co/1x5kGTWw8A,2020-01-27 01:34:44,Twitter for iPhone,12073,76120
The President blocked our request for Bolton’s testimony.  Now we see why:  Bolton directly contradicts the heart of the President’s defense.  If the trial is to be fair Senators must insist that Mr. Bolton be called as a witness and provide his notes and other documents. https://t.co/go9DJdRDEf,2020-01-27 00:15:47,Twitter for iPhone,38225,112410
I join the rest of Los Angeles in mourning the tragic death of Kobe Bryant his daughter and others.  One of the greatest basketball players of all time Kobe had a grace and athleticism unmatched in the NBA.

It requires moral courage to stand up to this President.  There's no doubt that he is vindictive — his threatening tweet about me today is proof positive.  But we all have an obligation to do the right thing.  Moral courage is rare. But it is never more essential than now. https://t.co/sNDdd4Ii9t,2020-01-26 18:39:26,Twitter Media Studio,27014,96174
The President's legal defense boils down to this:  Deprive Americans of a fair trial.  But Americans know what a fair trial looks like. They know it requires witnesses and documents.  If Trump's team succeeds in orchestrating a trial without them  There will be no exoneration. https://t.co/WEJkFMZBbo,2020-01-26 17:41:41,Twitter Media Studio,11513,40846
After listening to the President’s lawyers opening arguments I have three observations:  They don’t contest the facts of Trump’s scheme.  They’re trying to deflect distract from and distort the truth.  And they are continuing to cover it up by blocking documents and witnesses.,2020-01-25 17:06:03,TweetDeck,58475,202176
All over the world those living under oppressive regimes look to us.   They look to us because we have a rule of law. Because in America no one is above that law.   To my Senate colleagues I implore you:  Give America a fair trial.  She's worth it. https://t.co/FoPdno5Qy4,2020-01-25 02:14:18,Twitter Media Studio,35494,128338
Let’s imagine it wasn’t Joe Biden.  Let’s imagine it was any one of us.  Let’s imagine the most powerful man in the world was asking a foreign nation to conduct a sham investigation of us.  What would we think about it then?  Because next time it might be. https://t.co/WlnlPPGSCY,2020-01-24 20:53:20,Twitter Media Studio,19069,70707
Donald Trump must be convicted and removed from office.  Because he will always choose his own personal interest over our national interest.   Because in America right matters. Truth matters.   If not no Constitution can protect us.  If not we are lost. https://t.co/USfx6v9KsT,2020-01-24 04:10:06,Twitter Media Studio,72548,225940
Americans know about Trump's Ukraine scheme because people with a sense of duty were willing to step forward and speak out.  People like Ambassadors Yovanovitch and Taylor Lt. Col. Vindman Dr. Hill.  They were willing to risk their careers. Can Members of Congress do the same? https://t.co/ac3WvdYULR,2020-01-23 03:38:27,Twitter Media Studio,24334,95823
Time and time again President Trump has shown he will continue to abuse his power unless we hold him accountable.  The only appropriate remedy for a President of the United States so unwilling to be constrained by the rule of law?  Impeachment and removal from office. https://t.co/JOlxRLllUB,2020-01-23 00:01:33,Twitter Media Studio,18989,74297
Senators get 16 hours to ask questions. Wouldn't they like to ask about documents?  If McConnell gets his way they won't see any documents before their questions.  Even if documents are allowed later they can't ask a single question about them.  Americans deserve a fair trial. https://t.co/wF5SBs9xV8,2020-01-22 00:50:04,Twitter Media Studio,23080,77676
Trump's lawyer claimed the House isn't ready to present our case.  We’re ready.  The House calls John Bolton to testify. The House calls Mick Mulvaney.  We’re ready to present our case ready to call witnesses ready to see the documents.  The question: Will the Senate let us? https://t.co/MD5d1bqsxU,2020-01-21 21:55:08,Twitter Media Studio,23441,85534
Americans want a fair trial.  They want to believe their government is still capable of rising to the occasion.  They want to believe we can rise above party to do what’s best for our country.  Sadly a great many Americans doubt this is still possible.  Let's prove them wrong. https://t.co/VGor4FSQdS,2020-01-21 20:06:53,Twitter Media Studio,16949,65157
President Trump has engaged in the trifecta of constitutional misconduct warranting removal.  He invited foreign interference endangered our national security and sought to cheat in the next election.   He is the Framers’ worst nightmare.  Our response: https://t.co/h4rMqq5lTc,2020-01-20 18:12:23,Twitter for iPhone,14727,45682
No Mr. President we did ask John Bolton to testify. You ordered him not to and blocked others like Mick Mulvaney.  All Americans know what a fair trial includes documents and witnesses.   What are you hiding? https://t.co/XIMPtZa74O,2020-01-20 17:03:18,Twitter for iPhone,36290,117291
As we remember and honor the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. we must also challenge ourselves to live up to Dr. King’s example and continue to fight for the principles he held dear – tolerance justice and truth.
