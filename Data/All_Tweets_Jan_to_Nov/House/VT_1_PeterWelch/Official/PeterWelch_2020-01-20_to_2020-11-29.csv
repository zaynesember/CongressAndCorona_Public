VT communities have pulled together to help their neighbors during the pandemic. But Vermonters need more help. The most effective way for Congress to help hungry Vermonters is to boost the proven #SNAP which is the best way to fight food insecurity across the country. #vtpoli https://t.co/9PviM5AHZd,2020-11-24 19:19:02,Twitter Web App,9,39

Congress could learn a thing or two by tuning in to the town meetings happening all over our state today. #vtpoli https://t.co/hqTSfqrYZQ,2020-03-03 18:30:36,Twitter Web App,5,47
“A camel in Vermont?” Saddened to hear the news about Ferrisburgh’s own Ollie who frequently turned heads on Route 7. He will be missed!🐫https://t.co/TxjrGl7K4y,2020-02-28 20:47:08,Twitter Web App,4,19
I am all in to stop this bad idea. #LIHEAP #vtpoli,2020-02-26 22:35:09,Twitter Web App,2,16
President Trump wants to raid funds from a program that helps vulnerable families heat their homes to make up for his slow and inadequate #coronavirus response. We can fight this public health threat without shutting off people’s heat. #LIHEAP #vtpoli https://t.co/ATWHo9gNJY,2020-02-26 22:35:09,Twitter Web App,10,43
Today I visited with Dawn &amp; Greg Tatro at the future home of Jenna’s Promise Cafe named for their daughter who they lost to an overdose. Their tragedy has inspired them to help provide housing &amp; employment to VT’ers in recovery. Thank you for your passion &amp; leadership. #vtpoli https://t.co/9zBb4Mqbso,2020-02-18 20:05:36,Twitter Web App,7,38
Vermont is leading the way to cut down on plastic pollution — it’s time for Congress to do its part. This week we introduced federal legislation to reduce plastic pollution that too often ends up in landfills in the ocean or as litter. #vtpoli    https://t.co/xb1EuaDv6y,2020-02-14 19:22:51,Twitter Web App,8,34
Thank you Jillian for sharing your wonderful story. It was a pleasure to meet you and your dad William! Special thanks to Missy Siner Shea and all the folks at @SOVT. You’re doing great work! #SOHillDay #InclusionRevolution https://t.co/CgiXtTtw80,2020-02-11 22:04:10,Twitter Web App,3,15
This budget is morally and fiscally irresponsible. It’s also DOA. I’ll be working with @SenatorLeahy and @SenSanders to make sure Vermonters are protected. #vtpoli https://t.co/tJjfr5ZS7x,2020-02-11 20:32:06,Twitter Web App,10,34

I sat down with @RepJohnCurtis to talk about the Recreational Trails Program Full Funding Act that we introduced this week. This bipartisan bill will nearly triple the funding for this program that builds recreational trails in Vermont and across America. #vtpoli https://t.co/BG86oNPX6f,2020-02-07 21:47:28,Twitter Media Studio,23,67
Today the House finally reaffirmed its constitutional responsibility regarding the use of military force. I fought hard for two bills that will stop President Trump from getting us into a war with Iran as a result of his erratic use of military force. #NoWarWithIran #vtpoli,2020-01-30 20:48:04,Twitter Web App,8,61
Tomorrow I’ll be hosting a Congress in Your Community event at 12:15 at the Birdseye Diner in Castleton. I want to hear your concerns and offer assistance with federal agencies. I hope you can stop by! #vtpoli https://t.co/zKeeGxRZMY,2020-01-30 19:19:41,Twitter Web App,1,5
Congrats to @MAMAVA for selling 1000 lactation suites. These suites give moms a private place to express milk or take care of their babies in busy spaces. This is social enterprise at its best – a business creating a solution for an important social need. https://t.co/LqCGna5HaZ,2020-01-28 20:10:48,Twitter Web App,3,20
Vermont businesses continue to innovate and pave the way for a cleaner greener future. Friday I visited @Beeswrap a Middlebury business crafting sustainable food storage solutions to cut down on plastic waste in our kitchens. They’re the bee’s knees! #beeswrap🐝 https://t.co/jnBdcf1TBD,2020-01-27 20:00:00,Twitter Web App,5,41
Proposed 100% tariffs on European wine imports will slam VT businesses &amp; consumers. Yesterday at @TheBevie802 I was joined by representatives of our amazing food &amp; beverage industry to highlight the impact these tariffs would have. #vtpoli https://t.co/NfTFQTqhZG,2020-01-23 23:12:27,Twitter Web App,5,12

On the 47th anniversary of #RoevWade women’s rights are under attack across the country. I am fighting to block outrageous attacks on women’s health and proud that Vermont is a leader in protecting women’s rights. #vtpoli,2020-01-22 21:13:52,Twitter Web App,8,45
10 years ago the #CitizensUnited decision opened the floodgate of corporate &amp; unregulated dark money in our elections. The House-passed #ForThePeopleAct will keep billionaires &amp; corporations with blank checks out of our political process. Time for the Senate to act. #vtpoli https://t.co/hQpAzqZ3cp,2020-01-21 19:25:57,Twitter Web App,22,52
America's long journey to achieve MLK's dream where a person is not judged by the color of his skin but the content of his character is under assault. But the memory of Dr. Martin Luther King sustains me and I think millions of Americans. #MLKDay,2020-01-20 15:29:48,Twitter for iPhone,5,20
While the victim of violence he spoke of love. While the road ahead was long and arduous he spoke of hope and commitment. While he worked in a hostile South surrounded by people who wished him harm he spoke of forgiveness. #MLKDay,2020-01-20 15:29:48,Twitter for iPhone,2,14
Before the annual gathering we all attended church at the Ebenezer Baptist Church where MLK was the pastor. I don’t remember his exact words but I remember like it was yesterday how his words stirred me. #MLKDay,2020-01-20 15:29:47,Twitter for iPhone,0,7
In the summer of 1967 I was working with a community organization on the West Side of Chicago. In August I traveled with a group of young people to Atlanta to attend the annual convention of Dr. King’s Southern Christian Leadership Conference. #MLKDay https://t.co/Sty2b92rsx,2020-01-20 15:29:47,Twitter for iPhone,7,32
