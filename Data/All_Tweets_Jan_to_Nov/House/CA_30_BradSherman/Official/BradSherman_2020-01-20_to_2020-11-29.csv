(5/5) Masking protects Americans from unnecessary identification in intelligence docs when they aren’t doing things like running a secret lobbying operation on behalf of a foreign government. Masking is not meant to protect people like #Flynn.,2020-05-14 18:18:34,Twitter Web App,1,3
(4/5) #Flynn subsequently admitted to illegal lobbying for Turkey. Flynn accepted hundreds of thousands from the government of Turkey without registering as a foreign agent. https://t.co/SGVypwtsyt,2020-05-14 18:18:33,Twitter Web App,2,5
(3/5) It turns out that one of the officials that sought #Unmasking that ultimately IDed #Flynn was the US Ambassador to Turkey. It would seem helpful to know (i.e. through whom) a country was trying to influence the US government.  https://t.co/x6qaJiNyef,2020-05-14 18:18:33,Twitter Web App,1,2

(1/5) The “controversy” over the #UnmaskingFlynn requests is completely manufactured.   1) Such requests are routine.   2) When an American is unmasked it’s not as though people can go public with the info to attack the American (it’s still going to be classified).,2020-05-14 18:18:33,Twitter Web App,7,14

What we need from China is not denials. What we need is access for U.S. and international researchers.

See Newsweek article about my Disaster Protection for Workers' Credit Act and the similar Senate bill. Paying a bill late during the COVID-19 crisis should not affect a credit score.

(2/2) To know if you are protected you must first find out if you have a federally-backed mortgage or live in an apartment that receives some form of federal support. The administration needs to publish a list of properties that are covered. See my letter on this: https://t.co/J1d6bKJIcH,2020-04-16 20:51:07,Twitter Web App,8,8

(2/3) I support the big stimulus bill if it’s drafted well &amp; gives big aid to families.

Starr notes virtually all of those convicted and removed by the Senate were judges. A senate made up of our nation’s founders in 1803 convicted Judge Pickering for drunkenness in court hardly a violation of criminal statute. (2/2),2020-01-28 20:31:36,Twitter Web App,5,7
#KenStarr representing Trump sought to define “high crimes and misdemeanors” by looking at precedent. (1/2),2020-01-28 20:31:36,Twitter Web App,6,8
In July of 2017 I filed #ArticlesOfImpeachment. I believe it was our constitutional duty to #Impeach the President whether or not the Senate convicts him.  https://t.co/g4M0N6jNFE,2020-01-28 18:00:25,Twitter Web App,6,14

Tonight the House passed the Never Again Education Act legislation I co-sponsored. The bill will give teachers the tools they need to teach about the Holocaust so we remember today and students will remember for decades to come. #WeRemember,2020-01-28 02:44:09,Twitter Web App,11,32
Bolton was there and has direct evidence of Trump's misconduct. We can't wait for a book release the American people must hear directly from #JohnBolton and other key witnesses now. A trial without witnesses or documents isn't a trial at all. https://t.co/UaCHdcu7Aw,2020-01-28 00:39:06,Twitter Web App,12,33
In 2018 a gunman entered the Tree of Life Synagogue killing 11. It was the worst antisemitic attack in US history but not the last. Only by honoring the millions of lives lost and combating intolerance today can we fulfill our promise of #NeverAgain. https://t.co/rcn2fuc7Fk,2020-01-27 16:56:56,Twitter Web App,6,12

As we mark this occasion may we recognize the vitality and strength that they have brought to our nation.,2020-01-25 23:46:32,Twitter for iPhone,4,22
Ignoring #ClimateChange won't make it go away. The Trump Admin’s latest effort to undo vital environmental protections would let federal agencies move forward with projects without factoring in the #ClimateCrisis. I joined 140 of my colleagues demanding that we #ProtectNEPA. https://t.co/iPsLrXkZgi,2020-01-24 00:22:24,Twitter for iPhone,14,40
After the first day Senate Republicans claim they didn’t learn anything. They did learn some new things but would learn far more if they voted to allow witnesses and subpoena documents. #EndTheCoverUp https://t.co/fSKOTjTFtH,2020-01-23 22:17:07,Twitter for iPhone,17,58

Today marks the 47th anniversary of #RoeVWade. We must redouble our efforts to protect women’s constitutional right to comprehensive reproductive healthcare. This administration is determined to roll back women’s ability to make their own decisions. We can't let them.,2020-01-22 17:18:58,Twitter Web App,12,27

Today marks a decade since the Supreme Court's #CitizensUnited decision allowed wealthy donors &amp; special interests to amass vast amounts of political influence.
