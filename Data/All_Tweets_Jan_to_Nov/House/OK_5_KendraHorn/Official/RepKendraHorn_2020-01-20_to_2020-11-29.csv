The Senate stimulus bill also includes line items totally unrelated to the pandemic: $1.75 billion for new FBI headquarters $8 billion for new fighter jets and weapons programs and other unrelated provisions. This shouldn't be an opportunity for pet projects.,2020-07-29 18:12:11,Twitter Web App,6,46
This bill includes no state and local funds to pay our heroes: our health workers first responders and other frontline employees. It has zero funding to expand SNAP and ends a moratorium on evictions. The American people need help. This doesn't cut it.,2020-07-29 18:12:11,Twitter Web App,2,27
The latest stimulus bill from McConnell is disastrous. It fails completely to meet the three T's: ❌Timely- It's so bad it will never even receive a vote in the Senate ❌Targeted- It's loaded with political pet projects ❌Transparent- Crafted with zero input from the other party,2020-07-29 18:12:11,Twitter Web App,27,172

I'm leading a bipartisan effort to include budget reforms in the next stimulus. Our national debt is on track to reach 108% of GDP by 2021 outpacing debt after WWII.

The $600 benefit ends this month. To prevent a lapse in assistance we need a bicameral bipartisan deal on what that benefit should be.

Tens of thousands of Oklahomans who lost their jobs due to COVID-19 still haven't received unemployment assistance they're entitled to. They are hanging by a thread.

Today I gave my State of the District for OK-5. I ran for Congress challenging the idea that both parties can't work together. Today I'm proud to say we've made real progress uniting lawmakers to pass meaningful reforms.

Over 500000 children rely on SoonerCare for health care access. Block grants put them in danger of losing access to the providers in their communities and to the lifesaving medications they need. That is the wrong direction for our state.,2020-01-30 21:02:38,Twitter Web App,10,33
OK failed to expand Medicaid and turned down many millions of federal dollars. Block grants will only make our state responsible for an even greater share of the cost of Medicaid. Block grants also allow state Medicaid programs to refuse to cover some FDA-approved drugs.,2020-01-30 21:02:38,Twitter Web App,10,27
The announcement that Oklahoma will seek waivers to shift Medicaid into a block grant program threatens health care access for almost 800000 Oklahomans while also increasing the cost and risk to state funds. This is not the answer to our current Medicaid crisis.,2020-01-30 21:02:37,Twitter Web App,8,21
The key to improving access to health care in Oklahoma is simple: expand Medicaid. This should not be a political decision but a decision focused on health care access cost and outcomes for Oklahomans. https://t.co/50czrlpjT7,2020-01-30 21:02:37,Twitter Web App,28,119
On @NASA’s Annual Day of Remembrance we honor and recognize the courageous @NASA_Astronauts and crewmembers who tragically lost their lives while working to advance our nation’s space program. We will always remember those we have lost and their great sacrifice. #NASARemembers https://t.co/R9Cb0hatsM,2020-01-30 18:36:26,Twitter Web App,16,32
Our goal is to strengthen America’s space program to create measures of accountability and transparency that protect taxpayers and to provide NASA with the resources it needs to develop a sound evidence-based plan for space exploration.,2020-01-29 20:53:37,Twitter for iPhone,1,20
The NASA Authorization Act of 2020 takes a thoughtful approach to sending Americans to the moon Mars and beyond an approach that decreases risk and values the stewardship of taxpayer dollars.,2020-01-29 20:53:36,Twitter for iPhone,1,14
For too long NASA’s work has suffered from fits and starts as short-term political priorities change. If we are to remain the world’s leader in space exploration NASA needs a long-term plan that prioritizes transparency accountability and effective programmatic management.,2020-01-29 20:53:36,Twitter for iPhone,0,17
The NASA Authorization Act of 2020 takes a comprehensive approach to supporting NASA’s work as a multi-mission agency emphasizing the importance of balanced exploration science aeronautics technology and education portfolios.,2020-01-29 20:53:36,Twitter for iPhone,1,17
We can no longer afford to play politics with space exploration. I’m proud to have introduced the bipartisan NASA Authorization Act the product of a year of hearings expert testimony and across-the-aisle conversation about the direction of our nation’s civil space program.,2020-01-29 20:53:36,Twitter for iPhone,11,122

Our fight for our military families isn’t over we still have more work to do. But the progress we’ve made over the past year is proof of what we can get done when both parties work together. https://t.co/SPtryQY918,2020-01-26 17:59:03,Twitter for iPhone,11,78

Hearing directly from constituents about the issues most important to them is one of my highest priorities. I enjoyed sitting down over a cup of coffee at Ray's Cafe this morning to discuss what we're getting done for Oklahomans. https://t.co/IICYau4Vz6,2020-01-23 15:28:00,Twitter for iPhone,9,102

May we continue to lift up the voices of those who came before us - like Clara Luper who led the 1958 Katz Drug Store sit-ins - and continue to fight for Dr. King’s dream. 📸 2&amp;3: @zlucerophoto,2020-01-21 17:34:10,Twitter for iPhone,1,16

During her lifetime OKC civil rights hero Clara Luper fought to give a voice to the voiceless. She helped the community around her "believe in the sun when the sun didn't shine." This #MLKDay weekend let us honor Clara Luper and recommit to her fight for justice and equality. https://t.co/9GgJMKZYhN,2020-01-20 02:03:57,Twitter Web App,34,189
