Our work for Oklahoma’s Fifth District is not over.,2020-11-04 16:41:50,Twitter Web App,9,272
We changed minds and built a movement of support in a district that pundits thought was unwinnable. When many voters in this district had lost faith that their vote counted for something we gave them hope. That’s a victory in itself.,2020-11-04 16:41:50,Twitter Web App,9,189
Thank you to all of the staff volunteers and supporters who put their hearts into this campaign. We made a difference by talking with Oklahomans at the doors and on the phones about the issues important to our state.,2020-11-04 16:41:49,Twitter Web App,3,110
The future of our communities is at stake. Those are things worth fighting for and I will not give up that fight. Not when we have so much work to do to give our families our workers and all Oklahomans a better life and a better shot at success.,2020-11-04 16:41:49,Twitter Web App,4,103

My opponent’s first problem is that all she has to say about tackling health care fits into eight sentences of buzzwords. Her second problem is that five of those sentences aren’t even hers. https://t.co/YY0EVyqiuN,2020-10-30 23:54:37,Twitter for iPhone,74,270

At the same time we can and must address climate change. Here in OK we know the value of conservation: my great grandparents packed up their lives to flee the Dust Bowl. I'm proud to have an A rating from LCV. Supporting the environment doesn't mean all-or-nothing solutions.,2020-10-23 11:54:57,Twitter Web App,4,53
Here’s one of the places Biden and I disagree. We must stand up for our oil and gas industry. We need an all-of-the-above energy approach that’s consumer friendly values energy independence and protects OK jobs. I'll keep fighting for that in Congress. https://t.co/9fIaZ8pyY1,2020-10-23 03:04:41,Twitter for iPhone,103,530
In the midst of a pandemic Oklahomans deserve to know the details of candidate plans on health care.

During a pandemic it’s more important than ever that Oklahomans have access to quality health care they can afford including prescription drugs and telemedicine.

FACT CHECK: Bice says she hasn’t cut funding for public schools but her record tells a different story. Cuts like these to public education helped set the stage for the 2018 teacher walkouts. #OK05Debate https://t.co/K1ImyFfyvi,2020-10-20 22:17:34,Twitter Web App,32,67
My bill provides educators an additional 25 percent hazard pay for the time they have to spend in person at schools during COVID-19.

Oklahomans are speaking out against my opponent’s plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act. We cannot afford to abolish health insurance -- especially in the midst of a global pandemic. https://t.co/wb2KUbMyG8 https://t.co/6nhrIv21Pq,2020-10-18 22:42:47,Twitter Web App,200,495
Abolishing the Affordable Care Act would leave hundreds of thousands of Oklahomans uninsured during a pandemic. Replacing their insurance with a savings account wouldn't come close to covering the cost of care especially if they got COVID. This isn't a plan - it's a disaster. https://t.co/KVvmbPV6dy,2020-10-18 20:00:00,Twitter Web App,91,227

We need to rise above politics as usual to see the big picture. The success of Oklahoma families depends on investing in public schools decreasing the cost of health care and protecting people with pre-existing conditions. Seeing the big picture means working for you. https://t.co/6CKJKrNJkP,2020-10-15 19:50:28,Twitter Web App,15,61
I have a record I’m proud to run on:   ✅ 24 bills signed into law by the President ✅ 4th in the House for standing up to the Speaker ✅ 53 town halls hosted   That’s what it looks like to stand up for Oklahoma and shake things up in Washington. #OK05Debate https://t.co/XKaFry0s4O,2020-10-15 16:04:05,Twitter Web App,33,235
Two debates still no plan from Bice to protect people with pre-existing conditions or cover many the Oklahomans who'd lose coverage if the Affordable Care Act were abolished. Instead she wants to replace insurance with health savings accounts. That’s not gonna cut it #OK05Debate https://t.co/32Sm5UEL8u,2020-10-15 02:57:44,Twitter Web App,44,127

Lying again. I’ve always opposed Medicare for All despite what my opponent and dark money groups say. I believe we need to strengthen the Affordable Care Act and expand Medicaid not eliminate private insurance. #OK05Debate https://t.co/rnF5fhCYAk,2020-10-15 02:51:30,Twitter Web App,44,202
I’m a representative for ALL Oklahomans regardless of party. That’s why I’ve hosted a record number of town halls during my first term. I’m beholden to Oklahomans and Oklahomans alone.

My opponent talks a big talk about funding the police but voted to cut $9 million from public safety in this year’s budget. They even had to cancel Trooper Academy in OK. We need action to improve police training not lip service. #OK05Debate  https://t.co/5nKHKq1X7v,2020-10-15 02:39:39,Twitter Web App,8,37
1 in 10 calls for police response involve a person with mental illness.  1 in 4 people killed by police live with mental illness.   That’s why I led a bipartisan bill to train police to recognize deescalate and properly respond to people in mental health crisis. #OK05Debate https://t.co/Zuoq4o2ZWY,2020-10-15 02:38:59,Twitter Web App,14,57

The same old political talking points aren’t going to cut it this election. Facts are facts: I voted against the Speaker more than 99 percent of other members of my party in the House.   I’m never afraid to stand up for Oklahoma.  #OK05Debate,2020-10-15 02:19:56,Twitter Web App,42,225
I supported Mayor Holt and the City Council when they took action to implement a mask ordinance -- because it saves lives. Living up to the Oklahoma standard means helping our neighbors and our community. Right now that means wearing a mask while out in public. #OK05Debate https://t.co/icXwBLW7eh,2020-10-15 02:09:32,Twitter Web App,21,118

Health insurance access is worth fighting for. Protections for people with pre-existing conditions are worth fighting for. The hundreds of thousands of Oklahomans who rely on the Affordable Care Act are worth fighting for. Let’s improve our health care system not throw it away.,2020-10-13 22:23:38,Twitter Web App,57,198
What if you get in a car accident? Would a savings account cover your trip to the emergency room? Or if you can’t afford insulin and slip into a diabetic coma - would your health savings account cover your hospital stay?  Ask most middle-class Oklahoma families. The answer is no.,2020-10-13 22:23:38,Twitter Web App,64,222
Today my opponent said we should abolish the ACA and replace health insurance with health savings accounts. That’s not a plan- that’s a disaster.  The average cost of a COVID hospital stay with no insurance is $73k. A health savings account won’t even come close to covering that https://t.co/abiOhr3wno,2020-10-13 22:23:37,Twitter Web App,333,793
