Nancy Pelosi is completely out of touch.  She calls confronting China a 𝘥𝘪𝘷𝘦𝘳𝘴𝘪𝘰𝘯. She calls peace in the Middle East a 𝘥𝘪𝘴𝘵𝘳𝘢𝘤𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯. She calls those who don’t agree with her 𝘥𝘰𝘮𝘦𝘴𝘵𝘪𝘤 𝘦𝘯𝘦𝘮𝘪𝘦𝘴. https://t.co/9jdi6WYMFx,2020-09-18 14:29:17,Twitter Media Studio,1275,2986

Myth 1: The Postal Service is being 'sabotaged.'  Fact: The Postal Service is properly funded for this election and beyond.

The legislation that Speaker Pelosi introduced at 11pm last night—written by her staff and her staff alone—and plans to vote on just 12 hours later is not only completely partisan. It is unworkable.

With no legislative text yet to read I hope Speaker Pelosi doesn’t abuse this moment for business as usual.

Democrats are trying to keep President Trump—or any future president—from being able to swiftly issue travel restrictions in the face of health threats like coronavirus.

Actions speak louder than words.
