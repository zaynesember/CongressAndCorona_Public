Here are some of my initial notes from looking at @realDonaldTrump’s proposed budget:  ✅Saves $4.4 trillion over 10 years ✅Aims to balance the budget within 15 years ✅Funds the border wall ✅Appropriately funds military ✅Reduces foreign aid spending,2020-02-10 20:35:57,Twitter for iPhone,7,42

Let’s not forget when the Trump campaign hired Mr. Manafort the FBI failed to tell the campaign that Mr. Manafort was under investigation.
