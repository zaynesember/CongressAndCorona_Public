The restaurant industry is probably one of the most impacted industries in the entire county. Millions of jobs nationwide have been lost. Families in Queens and across the country need the Senate to do its job and pass the Restaurants Act. https://t.co/02EylE5Zy1,2020-11-08 02:41:00,Sprout Social,5,28

@BeeForGeorgia @rajivdparikh @tbonier @JoeBiden @a_jan I do want to say that DNC finally made investments in organizers in 2017 &amp; sent many of us as surrogates.

Change is not easy. Humility is not easy. But we need to move forward in a united front. After 2016 we all came together to reform our party our processes. We knew one of the most important tasks was to win back the Presidency. That goal will likely be achieved.  (4/5),2020-11-06 14:13:39,Twitter for iPhone,2,21

“Good trouble” didn’t happen overnight. I’ve witnessed the works of these leaders during my few trips there.
