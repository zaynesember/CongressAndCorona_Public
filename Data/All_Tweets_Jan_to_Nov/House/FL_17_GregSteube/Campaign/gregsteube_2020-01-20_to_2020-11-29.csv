I encourage you to read the article below. The freedoms which we enjoy as Americans continue to be sought by millions throughout the world. President Trump is leading the fight against the world’s most visible oppressor – the Chinese Communist Party.  https://t.co/NIEmgzFpKO,2020-06-04 18:43:05,TweetDeck,3,4
Liberal governors like Roy Cooper have exploited the COVID-19 crisis from the very beginning and are now forcing us to relocate the #RNCConvention.  NC might be closed but Florida is open for business and ready to renominate @realDonaldTrump!  https://t.co/qH0NInvdsM,2020-06-04 17:28:26,Twitter Web App,6,9

When the history of the 2020 COVID Pandemic is written Florida's response and recovery will be seen as a success story. Democrat-led New York and Michigan? Not so much...  https://t.co/spGL1ofLVe,2020-05-30 18:35:00,TweetDeck,3,9
If we’ve learned anything from the pandemic It is that now more than ever we have to take the necessary steps to move our supply chains closer to home – out of China.   https://t.co/DEhFSPNdUG,2020-05-29 17:17:29,TweetDeck,3,6

This is dehumanizing disrespectful and should tell you everything you need to know about how Joe Biden views minority communities.  https://t.co/FS5j4zDQhe,2020-05-22 19:06:47,Twitter for iPhone,3,6
I encourage you to read this piece on how Florida’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic should earn our state praises from the entire country – especially the corrupt politicians and fake news media based out of New Jersey and New York  https://t.co/C98pHYpSCs,2020-05-21 21:37:44,Twitter Web App,5,11
Huge welcome to both @TomTiffanyWI and @MikeGarcia2020 as they are sworn in to Congress today. Their successes in California and Wisconsin are just the start for Republicans across the country in November and beyond.,2020-05-19 13:58:16,Twitter Web App,4,17
I’m working diligently to hold China accountable for its inconspicuous attempts to gather data on American citizens. We cannot let our guard down; the Communists never do.  https://t.co/5zTKbTMWwB,2020-05-18 21:32:49,TweetDeck,3,8
It’s official! We are 100 days out from the 2020 RNC Convention and formally re-nominating @realDonaldTrump.

While I have respect for scientists like Dr. Fauci I agree with Senator Rand Paul that  we’re allowing the opinions of one individual to carry far too much weight in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  https://t.co/rTAmbw2q4g,2020-05-14 20:50:33,TweetDeck,100,145
The SWAMP has been after anyone associated with President Trump from the day he announced his candidacy in 2015. I’m proud to see that General Flynn has had his name cleared.

"The Chinese are trying to shift the narrative from their initial responsibility for not fessing up to what was happening to 'We got on top of it and this is how we helped the world.'  Don't let it happen." - Secretary Rice  https://t.co/eIN9dlHnFe,2020-05-04 14:23:28,TweetDeck,5,7
I agree with the conclusions of the article’s authors. If the global COVID-19 pandemic has taught us anything it’s that we can no longer afford to rely on China and other adversaries to control a majority of our health care supply chain.  https://t.co/ePfGmnVect,2020-04-29 21:31:15,TweetDeck,7,15
The National Institute of Health (NIH) has been funding research by the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) for years. America should never – ever – spend American taxpayer dollars to support research by one of our main adversaries.  https://t.co/EtHs839LGU,2020-04-27 22:44:25,Twitter Web App,9,9

Every democratic candidate for president is fighting over how much they would raise your taxes and how they would decide to spend YOUR money.   Washington should be cutting spending not increasing the deficit and your taxes to fund socialist government programs. #DemDebate,2020-02-26 02:16:58,Twitter Web App,21,51

Last night @60Minutes highlighted @BernieSanders praising of Castro saying he "educated their kids gave them healthcare" and "totally transformed the society."  It's true he totally transformed Cuba...take a look for yourself!  We cannot let this man become president.,2020-02-24 15:37:29,Twitter for iPhone,39,44
