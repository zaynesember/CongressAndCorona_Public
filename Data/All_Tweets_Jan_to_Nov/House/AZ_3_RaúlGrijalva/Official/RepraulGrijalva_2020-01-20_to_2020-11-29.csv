Impeached President Trump only knows how to stir division and treat #SOTU like a campaign rally.   Meanwhile the American people are struggling to figure out their future  We deserve better.   Watch my video statement below. https://t.co/ANinbM1Z8O,2020-02-05 04:42:24,Twitter Media Studio,49,207
Trump's immigration policies have created a humanitarian crisis at the border.   Don't applaud him for traumatizing children condemning families to violence under 'remain in Mexico' and dismantling the U.S. asylum system as we know it. #SOTU https://t.co/m45SiF8FcE,2020-02-05 03:07:53,Twitter Web App,46,71
Trump's environmental policy: Auction off public lands to the highest bidder rollback regulations and give sweetheart deals to extraction industries that prioritize profits over people.   This is not protecting the environment. #SOTU  https://t.co/emcK23XM21,2020-02-05 03:02:29,Twitter Web App,224,363
Miles of new border wall construction mean more precious desert habitats at risk more militarized communities and more Native American sacred sites slated for destruction.

The only person destroying American healthcare is Donald Trump.   While he claims to protect preexisting conditions he’s currently working to dismantle the ACA in court—jeopardizing care for 2.7 million Arizonans with preexisting conditions. #SOTU https://t.co/XosCLPQ8NR,2020-02-05 02:43:58,Twitter Web App,18,31
Trump claims to put the military first--until they get in the way of his vanity wall.

The regulations gutted by Trump in the name of 'energy independence' save lives and protect every American’s access to clean air water and land.

A low unemployment rate means nothing if millions working 40+ hours a week live in poverty.
