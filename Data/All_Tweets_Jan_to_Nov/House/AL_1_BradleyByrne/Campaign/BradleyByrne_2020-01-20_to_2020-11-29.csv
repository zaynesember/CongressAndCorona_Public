You'd think as a coach @TTuberville would want to be in the game. It's a shame my questions went unanswered because he failed to show.  Why is he for amnesty for illegal aliens?

There are Democrats who are people of faith and don’t want this for their Party. But they are being crowded out and increasingly find their views minimized. We should all work together to push back against those bent on forcing their radical views on the rest of us.,2020-01-30 17:30:30,Twitter for iPhone,4,11
The reality is the national Democratic Party has been taken over by atheist secular socialists who want to force all of us to take God out of the center of our lives and replace Him with big centralized government.

The agreement does exactly what @realDonaldTrump  promised in his campaign: it raises the amount of made in America products that Mexico and Canada will buy with exports to Canada increasing by an estimated $19 billion and exports increasing to Mexico by $14.2 billion. #USMCA,2020-01-29 16:27:13,Twitter Web App,4,35

They have appropriately skewered Schiff and the fraudulent process used by the House. This entire impeachment process has been about overturning the results of the 2016 election and doing everything they can to damage President Trump ahead of this year’s election. IT WON’T WORK!,2020-01-25 17:47:46,Twitter for iPhone,18,82
President @realDonaldTrump’s legal term has done a brilliant job of exposing the gaping holes in the Democrat case especially disputing all the lies from Adam Schiff. Today has been nothing short of a disaster for the radical Left.,2020-01-25 17:45:39,Twitter for iPhone,56,227
What Adam Schiff is doing on the Senate floor might as well be a Democrat political rally! It has been an embarrassment and made a complete mockery of the entire process. Thankfully the American people are seeing this for what it is: a pathetic joke.,2020-01-24 22:21:54,Twitter for iPhone,60,246
