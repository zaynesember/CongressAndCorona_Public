The #HeroesAct is first and foremost a jobs bill. It keeps our essential workers safe. It keeps our airline industry &amp; other industries moving so they can continue to employ thousands across our region. It keeps the lights on at our schools. Pass it now! https://t.co/dbM8d68enK,2020-09-30 19:53:02,Twitter Web App,9,16
The issues that indigenous women and women of color face in health care represent not only structural racism but also structural violence.   All of us deserve better. https://t.co/e8xNYfnaeO,2020-09-30 17:33:18,Twitter for iPhone,2,5

Our country has a sad history of undercounting and partially counting minority groups and undermining their very humanity. The best way for us to fight back is to fill out your census if you haven’t already and encourage all of your neighbors to do the same.,2020-09-24 23:14:15,Twitter for iPhone,2,10
Trump’s administration of the census undercounts the homeless immigrant communities people of color and many others. Our president seems to think the only demographic that counts are the wealthy boat owners and he ignores the folks who make up the fabric of our community. https://t.co/lh71VsAUue,2020-09-24 23:14:15,Twitter for iPhone,5,16

Breonna Taylor was one of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s constituents. In the name of all that is decent the Senator should bring the Justice in Policing Act forward and save lives in Kentucky and across our Country. #SayHerNameBreonnaTaylor,2020-09-23 21:18:04,Twitter for iPhone,8,39
However we cannot despair or become numb to these miscarriages of justice. Congress has the power to act and the House passed the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act to ban no-knock warrants - the same type of warrant that ultimately legalized murder that night in Kentucky.,2020-09-23 21:18:04,Twitter for iPhone,2,18
I am deeply saddened that no one was directly charged for the murder of Breonna Taylor. While a former police officer was charged for his reckless disregard for human life that night this is a decision that is both disappointing and not surprising. #SayHerName,2020-09-23 21:18:03,Twitter for iPhone,12,63

Yesterday we introduced the #Momnibus 9 bills to address the Black maternal health crisis.  Black moms are *four times* more likely to die in childbirth than white moms but we can close that gap.  Please ask your representatives and Senators to cosponsor the Momnibus! https://t.co/nzkTDrUndQ,2020-03-11 12:37:04,Twitter for iPhone,69,196

This #Momnibus legislation says unequivocally that #BlackMomsMatter. I’m proud to stand with my colleagues to unveil a comprehensive package that tackles one of the greatest public health crises of our time. https://t.co/rczJiwzx45,2020-03-10 17:38:11,Twitter for iPhone,27,55
For decades the US maternal mortality and morbidity rates have gotten worse for all mothers but especially for Black women whose health outcomes are further compounded by systemic and structural racism. #Momnibus #BlackMomsMatter,2020-03-10 17:35:16,Twitter for iPhone,24,44
Kira Johnson died 12 hours after delivering her son Langston. Kira deserved better because #BlackMomsMatter. I’m leading the Kira Johnson Act to invest in community-based organizations and promote culturally congruent maternal health care. #Momnibus,2020-03-10 17:30:35,Twitter for iPhone,51,101
Black women also experience higher rates of maternal complications and infant mortality. They are twice as likely to lose an infant to premature death and these disparities have not improved for more than 30 years. https://t.co/8hrWQRbgv9,2020-03-10 17:27:59,Twitter for iPhone,28,58
The US has the worst maternal death rates in the developed world and the only rate that is rising. The maternal mortality rate is significantly higher among black women who are three to four times more likely than white women to die from pregnancy-related complications. https://t.co/y8sVVSj4MW,2020-03-10 17:27:57,Twitter for iPhone,33,52
