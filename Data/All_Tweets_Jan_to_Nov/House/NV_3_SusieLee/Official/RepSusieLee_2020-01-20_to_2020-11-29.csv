Two weeks ago I joined over 100 of my colleagues in Congress to call on leadership to pass an emergency extension to the $600/week in unemployment relief.   That relief expired a month ago and Americans are still waiting on us to act.   Time is up. Let’s get this done. https://t.co/B45b2yJMqu,2020-08-31 22:15:00,TweetDeck,11,65
This is the right call. Thank you @GovSisolak.  But this is still just a short-term solution. Congress needs to pass an extension to the $600/week in unemployment rental assistance and other vital relief.  The House passed the #HeroesAct 3 months ago. Let's move. Time is up. https://t.co/9PSXpdVFf7,2020-08-31 21:55:37,TweetDeck,20,47
The Nevada Commercial Rent Assistance Program is being extended by one week👇👇  This is a great resource but Congress needs to pass long-term comprehensive relief for renters landlords and families (like the #HeroesAct that the House passed 100+ days ago). https://t.co/VW4wbSmo8y,2020-08-31 21:35:19,TweetDeck,4,9
🚨BREAKING🚨 After bipartisan pressure @USDA will extend critical student meal program waivers through Dec. 31 2020.  This is great news but this fix is only temporary.

During my 2+ decades of work with Nevada schools I saw the impact of wraparound services 1st hand &amp; how tough it is on kids when they’re not available.  Bottom line: If we truly want to make education a national priority we have to invest in wrap-around school services. 4/4,2020-08-29 16:14:49,Twitter for iPhone,0,4
It’s a fact that if students have access to nutrition tutoring after school programs etc they‘ll perform better in school. It’s also a fact that students from low-income neighborhoods &amp; communities of color rarely have equal access to these services. 3/,2020-08-29 16:14:49,Twitter for iPhone,0,4
Wrap-around services are things like tutoring after school programs college prep access to food/nutrition mental health support etc. All things that give students mainly those in underserved communities help that supports the WHOLE child not just their test scores. 2/,2020-08-29 16:14:48,Twitter for iPhone,0,7

Nevada Reading Week starts next week but it never hurts to get an early jump on that reading list!  On the list today at M.J. Christensen Elementary: Grace Goes to Washington #teachagirl https://t.co/rcbLhGbUIa,2020-02-24 19:14:29,TweetDeck,3,6
A book is more than just a story.   A good book can spark that passion and curiosity to learn making reading more than just an assignment or a chore.   No doubt I’ve seen that spark a few times this morning at M.J. Christensen Elementary📚💡#teachagirl https://t.co/zcaOU1p6LL,2020-02-24 18:52:08,TweetDeck,2,10
We need to talk more about the hidden costs of higher education.   For working families limited access to public transportation is one of those hidden costs.

As Public School Week gets underway I want to highlight one of my top priorities the Keep Our PACT Act.  My bill w/@ChrisVanHollen fully funds Title 1 &amp; IDEA special education. It’s the kind of investment we need if we really care about our students teachers &amp; schools. #PSW20,2020-02-24 17:55:44,TweetDeck,1,3

There’s no doubt caregivers are some of the hardest working most underpaid workers in the country.

Rising anti-Semitism should concern every one of us. #NeverAgain isn't just a creed for the global Jewish community but for every person who never wants the world to experience terror like the Holocaust ever again. We all hold that responsibility. https://t.co/7JrtLlLYfR,2020-01-27 18:45:00,TweetDeck,2,11

.@BetsyDeVosED has the gall to tell students that she’s “working to protect students from predatory practices and to be fair to institutions and taxpayers at the same time.”  We’ve got the receipts. Her policies do just the opposite. https://t.co/CvtHEx7ms9,2020-01-25 21:00:00,TweetDeck,13,40

As I said even in cases where the schools clearly violated the law the burden of proof on the defrauded student is so absurdly unrealistic it would take a team of lawyers for the student to have a shot at proving intent and misconduct from the school. https://t.co/5qYR9zAslH,2020-01-23 20:04:00,TweetDeck,4,15

My House-passed bill to overturn the DeVos 2019 Borrower Defense Rule is a Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution.
