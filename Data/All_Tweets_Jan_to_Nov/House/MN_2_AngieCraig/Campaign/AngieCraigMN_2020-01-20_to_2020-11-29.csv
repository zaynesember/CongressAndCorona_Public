The voters of Minnesota’s Second Congressional District deserve representation in Congress next January – and this is an important step in making sure that they do! Voters in #MN02 should keep voting their full ballots in the November general election. https://t.co/maOGmtKVXk,2020-10-11 23:55:00,Twitter Web App,14,62
If health care isn’t affordable it isn’t accessible. That’s why I’ve worked on over 100 bills to fix our broken health care system by expanding coverage and lowering costs. Because every Minnesotan has the right to health care at a price they can afford. https://t.co/JtDTpUSWCz,2020-10-11 22:10:00,Twitter Web App,7,27
We made a promise to our seniors that if they work hard and play by the rules the federal government will do its part and provide for them in retirement.

Today’s debate demonstrated just how important it is that we keep #MN02 blue this year. Minnesotans deserve a representative who will put their interests first help us emerge from this time of crisis and defend the health care access we’ve fought so hard to ensure.,2020-10-09 20:00:55,Twitter Web App,21,90
Minnesotans deserve a Representative who work with anyone – Republican or Democrat – to get the job done for #MN02. Unfortunately today’s debate showed that @KistnerCongress isn’t the right person for the job.,2020-10-09 16:59:57,Twitter Web App,13,50
Folks in #MN02 deserve a representative who will get the job done in Congress – no matter who’s in the White House. Even with a Republican President I’ve had two bipartisan bills signed into law – as many as any other member in the Minnesota delegation.,2020-10-09 16:57:12,Twitter Web App,9,41
A reminder of what could happen if @KistnerCongress is successful in repealing the ACA:   ✔️266000 Minnesotans would lose coverage overnight ✔️ 300000 Minnesotans with pre-existing conditions in #MN02 could lose their care ✔️Drug costs for seniors would skyrocket,2020-10-09 16:49:04,Twitter Web App,22,47
Hundreds of thousands of Minnesotans are out of work and small businesses across #MN02 are struggling but my opponent and the president have walked away from the negotiating table. Minnesotans deserve better than that.,2020-10-09 16:42:24,Twitter Web App,11,42
The President failed to protect the American people during this public health crisis – and now more than 200000 Americans are dead. And my opponent still can’t bring himself to call on the Administration to lead. That’s unacceptable. #MN02,2020-10-09 16:40:54,Twitter Web App,7,27
Today I’ll be sitting down (virtually) with my opponent and the folks at @MPRnews for our 2nd debate! Tune in at 11:30 to hear me talk about my record of defending our health care from partisan attacks supporting small businesses &amp; advocating for #MN02 farmers in Congress!,2020-10-09 16:17:20,Twitter Web App,6,25
Congratulations Pete! You’re a shining example of what an accomplished career in the trades can look like and that’s exactly why I’m fighting every day to expand access to career and technical education to students across Minnesota.   https://t.co/FDZJbolKOM,2020-10-08 21:10:00,Twitter Web App,1,15
I just stepped off the debate stage where I showed folks in #MN02 why I’m the right candidate to lower the cost of health care protect Social Security &amp; Medicare from partisan attacks and rebuild an economy that works for every Minnesotan.,2020-10-08 16:02:52,Twitter Web App,20,113
Social Security &amp; Medicare are benefits that #MN02 seniors have earned after a lifetime on the job but @KistnerCongress has called for cuts and privatization of these crucial programs. In Congress I’ll always stand up to partisan attacks on the benefits you deserve.,2020-10-08 15:57:52,Twitter Web App,12,33
It’s long past time that Congress gave power back to the people in #MN02. It's why I introduced a bill to ban Members of Congress from serving as lobbyists force lawmakers to sell individual stocks before they’re sworn in &amp; stopped my own party from giving Congress a pay raise.,2020-10-08 15:40:03,Twitter Web App,12,39
The Affordable Care Act has been the law of the land for a decade – but @KistnerCongress is still playing politics with Minnesotans’ health care and would rip health care away from millions in the middle of a deadly pandemic. #MN02 can’t afford his reckless partisan attacks.,2020-10-08 15:28:18,Twitter Web App,18,45
Despite Tyler’s claims to the contrary protecting public health &amp; supporting the nation’s economic recovery are not contradictory goals. In order to reopen safely &amp; get Americans back to work we need to get a handle on this virus. #MN02,2020-10-08 15:17:05,Twitter Web App,13,65
President Trump knew exactly how deadly COVID-19 could be but he failed to warn us. Despite that my opponent still has nothing but praise for the Administration’s COVID-19 response – that shows you exactly what type of a Representative he would be. #MN02.,2020-10-08 15:10:37,Twitter Web App,34,102
It’s debate day in #MN02! Today my opponent and I will be sitting down with the @dcrchamber to discuss how we can rebuild our economy.

If health care isn’t affordable it isn’t accessible. That’s why I’ve worked on 100 bills aimed at bringing down the cost of health care. Because everyone regardless of income should be able to see a doctor where they live at a price they can afford. https://t.co/nX91efRdDT,2020-10-05 16:25:00,Twitter Web App,6,26
