We can save lives if @senatemajldr does the right thing for the countless survivors of gun violence in Las Vegas and across the country.   It's time for the Senate to vote on #HR8 and expand background checks. #GunViolenceSurvivorsWeek,2020-02-07 18:11:14,Twitter Web App,18,54
President Trump’s decision to take money from foreign governments looking to curry favor with his Administration is unethical unacceptable and illegal. President Trump may have called the Emoluments Clause ‘phony’ but some of us take our oath to the Constitution seriously.,2020-02-07 16:41:05,Twitter Web App,19,62
Our lawsuit hit a roadblock because we didn't have a majority in the House when we filed it. Now that we do the House should vote to enforce the law.

Trump broke the promise he made when he said in Elko that he would respect our state’s opposition to Yucca Mountain. I have no reason to trust him this time around.   I'll keep fighting to make sure that our state does not become a dumping ground for the nation’s nuclear waste.,2020-02-06 23:24:00,Twitter Web App,79,261
They say if you can’t beat them join them.   President Trump tried to shove nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain down our throats for three years.  We beat him badly and he knows it. https://t.co/3VXjSHSX23,2020-02-06 22:32:43,Twitter Web App,78,251
At a time when corporate profits are soaring it shouldn't be so difficult for hardworking people to make ends meet. The #PROAct strengthens workers’ power to organize and negotiate for a fair share of the profits they produce. https://t.co/Fb5d0kezgU,2020-02-06 21:43:00,Twitter Web App,2,11
What happened yesterday will not change the fact that President Trump was impeached for abusing his power and trying to cover it up.   In fact nothing will ever change that. #ImpeachedForLife,2020-02-06 20:17:50,Twitter Web App,17,73
President Trump tried to cheat in the 2020 elections and then he worked with Republican Senators to cover it up. I am proud of the work we did in the House – led by Chairman Schiff – to hold President Trump accountable for his grotesque abuse of power.” 3/3,2020-02-05 22:09:50,Twitter Web App,3,42
Yet almost every Republican Senator voted against a fair trial. They are obviously scared of the truth. History will judge them poorly for their cowardice. 2/3,2020-02-05 22:09:50,Twitter Web App,2,36
Donald Trump is the first President in history to face a bipartisan vote from the Senate to convict and remove him from office.

President Trump said he's protecting people with pre-existing conditions yet he's in court trying to take those protections away.   He said he's ending our wars in the Middle East yet he's escalating them.   Trump doesn't even tell the truth when he's reading a script. #SOTU,2020-02-05 03:39:43,Twitter Web App,41,106
"We are working to end America's wars in the Middle East." - President Trump at #SOTU   In the past year President Trump has deployed more than 20000 additional U.S. troops to the Middle East.,2020-02-05 03:20:34,Twitter Web App,17,49

"My Administration is restoring the rule of law" - President Trump at #SOTU   Less than three weeks ago the @USGAO found that the Trump Administration violated the law in its scheme to solicit foreign interference in our election.,2020-02-05 03:07:47,Twitter Web App,66,131
President Trump at #SOTU: "As we speak a long tall and very powerful wall is being built."  The wall: https://t.co/Ab2LqyFOun,2020-02-05 02:49:36,Twitter Web App,20,57
President Trump is lying when he says he'll protect people with pre-existing conditions.   He spent his first two years in office trying to take health care away from people with pre-existing conditions. He failed and now he's trying to do it through the courts. #SOTU,2020-02-05 02:44:53,Twitter Web App,24,64
"I keep my promises" - President Trump at tonight's #SOTU   "We cannot let those killed in El Paso Texas and Dayton Ohio die in vain...We can never forget them...Republicans and Democrats must come together and get strong background checks" - President Trump last August,2020-02-05 02:30:06,Twitter Web App,93,282
At the #SOTU President Trump is bragging about the opportunity zones he created.   Instead of helping Americans who are struggling to make ends meet they were a "windfall for the rich."  https://t.co/zRloDJltwQ,2020-02-05 02:21:36,Twitter Web App,11,31
The average monthly job gain during President Obama's last four years was 217000.   The average monthly job gain under President Trump so far is 191000.   #SOTU,2020-02-05 02:19:34,Twitter Web App,13,47
Will President Trump use #SOTU2020 to explain why he is in court trying to take health care away from people with pre-existing conditions?   Probably not because the #StateOfHealthCare is...under attack.,2020-02-04 21:00:20,Twitter Web App,8,21
