WE WILL NOT BE INTIMIDATED #VelshiAcrossAmerica @AliVelshi,2020-10-18 12:43:55,Twitter for iPhone,50,265
We can fix the Indigenous community's trust in our government by giving them a voice listening to them and electing more Native leaders. Our voices need to be heard - it's why I ran for Congress in the first place.  #VelshiAcrossAmerica #Vote  @VelshiMSNBC @AliVelshi,2020-10-18 12:42:27,Twitter for iPhone,75,342

🚨MAGA SUPPORTER ALERT🚨 My opponent announced her support for all of Trump’s failed policies including locking kids in cages and his COVID response that has killed over 200000 Americans.

Donald Trump and Republicans have shown that they don’t support our service members. When Trump built his reckless border wall he diverted over 3 billion in funds that should have gone to our military service members. It's time we say no to Trump &amp; his Republicans. #NMCD1Debate,2020-10-11 22:40:57,Twitter Web App,29,78

Any Republican that supports Trump supports his policies to separate families put children in cages and cut off people from their healthcare. We can’t afford Republican leadership in New Mexico. We must elect Dems up and down the ballot. Our Democracy is at stake. #NMCD1Debate,2020-10-11 22:32:22,Twitter Web App,51,173

#BlackLivesMatter and the senseless killings of Black Americans have shown us that we need to reform our police departments.

I told New Mexicans that if they sent me to Congress I would fight for them and stand up to Trump. In my 2 years I’ve fought the Trump administration on drilling on our public lands and taking away healthcare and when I got the opportunity I voted to impeach Donald Trump.,2020-10-11 22:18:03,Twitter Web App,67,473
Here are the facts. Donald Trump knew this virus was going to be deadly. He did nothing ❌. When the experts said to wear a mask he mocked them ❌. Now that he has COVID he still doesn’t get it ❌. That’s three strikes Mr. President. #NMCD1Debate,2020-10-11 22:10:24,Twitter Web App,34,128
When this pandemic began House Democrats went to work. We passed the #HeroesAct which extended aid to our working families &amp; small businesses and we passed the #CaresAct which sits on Mitch McConnell's Desk. Republicans have failed Americans during this pandemic. #NMCD1Debate,2020-10-11 22:07:17,Twitter Web App,41,125
Getting the Job done in Congress means working across the aisle to pass legislation that helps all Americans. In Congress I’ve worked with @TomColeOK04 and others from his party to protect our public lands and ensure our indigenous communities received aid during this pandemic.,2020-10-11 22:05:01,Twitter Web App,9,41
Since going to Washington I’ve held Trump accountable. I voted on his impeachment and when he wanted to drill in Bear's ears and Chaco Canyon I stood up to him and said no.
