We are now at a point in our history where we have to rethink the @WellsFargo paradigm. At some point the long arm of the law has to reach Wells Fargo.,2020-03-11 15:42:12,Twitter for iPhone,2,25
@WellsFargo created 1.5M fraudulent accounts. Yet no one has been prosecuted.,2020-03-11 15:40:34,Twitter for iPhone,0,2

This cannot be resolved by just paying off the government. @WellsFargo must atone for its transgressions by addressing how it treats employees &amp; what will be done to ensure it never happens again. Most importantly WF cannot continue withwhat appears to be a criminal enterprise.,2020-03-10 14:32:24,Twitter for iPhone,11,46
Of all of the top banks - the so called ‘too big to fail’ banks there has never been a CEO or top officer of any of these banks to go to jail. It seems that they are not only ‘too big to fail’ they’re also too big to jail.,2020-03-10 14:29:21,Twitter for iPhone,51,231
How is that  @WellsFargo can pay a $3B fine commit fraud open accounts without knowledge of customers and not one person goes to jail? https://t.co/ZiU13EYce0,2020-03-10 14:28:42,Twitter for iPhone,36,94

Mr. President blaming CNN for reporting news and Democratic politicians for speaking out is more propaganda than a plan when it comes to dealing with the coronavirus.

In a righteous world Attorney General Barr would resign for corrupting the Justice Department.  In President Trump’s world Mr. Barr is likely a candidate for the Medal of Freedom.   Wake up America!

The President's reprehensible behavior was on full display in last night's #SOTU speech. His dastardly words and deeds continue to divide our Nation. Today Senators must hold this #ImpeachedPresident accountable or be held accountable on Election Day.  #ImpeachmentDay,2020-02-05 18:14:23,Twitter Web App,169,638
Because of an impeached reckless ruthless lawless shameless corrupt &amp; unapologetically bigoted president - who is still engaging in a coverup the state of the House the state of the Senate and the #StateOfTheUnion are divided.

Mr. Bolton praising others for courageously answering Thomas Paine's clarion call to come to the aid of our country isn't enough. What you can do later in a book you should do now. Speak up or become among the spineless of history. #BoltonMustSpeakUp https://t.co/kTnO1vxmku,2020-01-31 12:50:35,Twitter Web App,76,200
Senators how can you possibly thwart efforts to have the former National Security Adviser give testimony before the Senate in the impeachment trial? This is bigger than you. It's bigger than all of us.   #JohnBoltonMustTestify  https://t.co/bZstK6y7nt,2020-01-28 16:01:38,Twitter Web App,850,1933

It has become glaringly apparent that Mr. Bolton has information that could be essential to the fate of not only the Senate impeachment trial but also our Nation. Choosing not to subpoena him puts party above politics and this President above the law.  #JohnBoltonMustTestify,2020-01-28 13:41:23,Twitter for iPhone,697,1908
