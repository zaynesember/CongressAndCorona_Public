I'm committed to the fight to make an America where our communities of color no longer have to fear or face senseless tragedies like these.,2020-05-31 22:33:52,Twitter for iPhone,0,1
In the days to come let's continue to express ourselves vigorously and peacefully to honor the lives of these Americans. Don't let anyone distract from the message—one of justice and humanity no matter the color of your skin.,2020-05-31 22:33:21,Twitter for iPhone,0,1
No one should have to fear that an interaction with police will result in their murder. Every officer involved in George Floyd's murder must be arrested and brought to justice. Their actions were reprehensible unforgivable and un-American.,2020-05-31 22:32:40,Twitter for iPhone,0,2
Our communities are reeling from the cold-blooded killings of George Floyd Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery. The past week has been painful—and the fact that we find ourselves coping with a tragedy like this once again makes it that much worse.,2020-05-31 22:32:16,Twitter for iPhone,1,3

We’re all inspired by how our students have adapted to #DistanceLearning and persevered during these unprecedented times. That’s why I’m launching a Distance Learning Challenge to recognize their engagement and resilience amid the #COVID19 pandemic.   ➡️ https://t.co/G69S8LIhhl https://t.co/oIvJdCgGpB,2020-05-19 18:33:57,Twitter for iPhone,7,8
