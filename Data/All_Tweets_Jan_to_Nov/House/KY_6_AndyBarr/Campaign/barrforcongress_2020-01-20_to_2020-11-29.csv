As someone who has spent a lot of time with our agricultural community I know this isn’t true and hard working farmers deserve a lot better than this. https://t.co/RlvbI2Hgg1,2020-03-02 16:19:02,Sprout Social,5,25
For all the talk about the Green New Deal Democrats didn’t think everything through. Wind turbine parts can’t be recycled and landfills are already filling up with them. This is terrible for the environment and AOC and her fellow socialists should go back to the drawing board! https://t.co/2gJhsNEPtn,2020-03-01 17:25:01,Sprout Social,11,31
Our country has created over 7 million new jobs over the last 3 years and 225000 in the last month alone. Americans are more hopeful about the future than ever before and yet Democrats continue to push policies that would undo all of this and send America in the wrong direction. https://t.co/FUr0ivxuF4,2020-02-29 22:33:01,Sprout Social,1,5
I was proud to introduce a bipartisan bill to help victims of sexual assault in the military. I’ve been fighting for this for several years and we must do everything we can to help victims get the care they need and ensure that they are not revictimized when they do seek help. https://t.co/FmxwQ1Z8dY,2020-02-28 19:55:04,Sprout Social,0,2
It was completely inappropriate for Senator Chris Murphy to meet with the Iranian Foreign Minister and undermine @realDonaldTrump. The fact that Dems are meeting with our adversaries means that mixed messages are being sent and this is deeply troubling for our national security. https://t.co/JHsqTJ3QqS,2020-02-27 21:23:02,Sprout Social,8,34
Bloomberg has a long record of racist and sexist remarks. His billions may buy him the nomination but he won't fool us in the fall. More damaging info seems to come out everyday and unlike Democrats who’ve endorsed him the American people will not be bought! https://t.co/BpxPrROXpC,2020-02-26 19:28:02,Sprout Social,1,11
The Washington Post ran an op-ed that suggested in the Democratic primary “elites” should have more of a say in choosing the nominee. This is just another example of Democrats wanting to take power away from the people because they do not trust us to make decisions for ourselves! https://t.co/F7LI2IGA7F,2020-02-25 20:27:02,Sprout Social,3,4
Watching Joe Biden’s Presidential campaign collapse over the past few months has been like watching a train derail in slow motion. I can remember a time when Uncle Joe was the heir apparent to Barack Obama but it seems like those days are long gone now. https://t.co/H7qHcNJJUi,2020-02-24 18:05:04,Sprout Social,2,3
Mayor Pete declared victory in Iowa before the results came out. Was it because his campaign paid $42.5K to the company that made the Iowa Caucus app? Or was it because Pete’s senior strategist is married to the woman who launched the app?  https://t.co/le00VX1njh https://t.co/J8szysPrAR,2020-02-23 21:04:01,Sprout Social,2,10
Draining the Swamp is more than kicking ineffectual career politicians and bureaucrats out. It’s about shrinking government and slashing government spending. That’s why I support President Trump’s $4.8 trillion spending cut and look forward to helping him pass it in the House. https://t.co/FRwgM9zt9D,2020-02-22 22:31:01,Sprout Social,3,8
I’ve been hearing from families all across KY how the Tax Cuts &amp; Jobs Act helped them. Wages are rising businesses are hiring and Americans’ taxes are lower.I’m proud to have helped pass it and I can’t wait to work with our President to keep helping all Americans prosper. https://t.co/CCqRjFXTwW,2020-02-21 18:12:03,Sprout Social,2,11
The Democrats failed to make the case to impeach President Trump. Now they’re failing to make the case to replace him in November. The President’s record is just too good. How can the Dems counter record employment safe borders and dead terrorists? Hint: They can’t. https://t.co/CtXohune8f,2020-02-20 21:23:01,Sprout Social,2,14
Right after President Trump was acquitted he and the Senate went right back to work confirming strong conservative judges to the federal bench. This Administration’s legacy will last long after 2024 with nearly 200 judicial appointments confirmed by the Senate. https://t.co/36PosunHx7,2020-02-19 19:20:03,Sprout Social,2,7
Sometimes I hear one of the Democratic primary candidates described as “the moderate candidate.” Let’s set the record straight. There’s not a single “moderate” Democrat in the race. They’ve all taken extremist stances on important issues. And they’re all unqualified to lead. https://t.co/tqgFwBkl1d,2020-02-18 20:21:02,Sprout Social,4,17
Rush Limbaugh has given a voice to millions of Americans and has spoken truth to power for decades. We are all saddened by his diagnosis but it was an honor to watch the President and First Lady bestow him the Medal of Freedom at the State of the Union and he is in our prayers. https://t.co/1cyCw1H83F,2020-02-17 17:10:16,Sprout Social,5,24
Democrats will not let the impeachment hoax go. They've said that they are likely to continue to issue subpoenas which would endanger the President’s ability to have private conversations with his advisors on our most important national security matters. https://t.co/J3xaWh3XOT,2020-02-16 16:46:06,Sprout Social,5,17
I am dedicated to fighting the addiction crisis and I was proud to support bipartisan legislation to keep the federal ban on fentanyl.

Wishing you and your family a Happy Valentine’s Day! Check out my special message to the Dems. Hopefully after 3 years they will move past 2016 but it seems they will continue their investigations to prop up their candidates that don’t stand a chance against the President! https://t.co/BhyKPew3G5,2020-02-14 16:49:14,Sprout Social,11,22
We stand in solidarity with Venezuelan's living in fear of the Maduro regime and Juan Guaidó the legitimate President at the SOTU showed the world the importance of standing up for freedom.

The first two Democratic contests have shown us socialism is on the rise and Bernie Sanders is close to a takeover of the Democratic Party. Bernie and his allies like AOC have a dangerous agenda that would change our country for the worse and it's up to us to defend our freedom. https://t.co/wRrHtYHayZ,2020-02-12 17:09:13,Sprout Social,2,19
Nancy Pelosi and the Dems have divided our country they refused to honor many of the people who were recognized at the SOTU and Pelosi herself ripped up the President’s speech. It’s time to restore respect for our institutions and and get back to work for the American people. https://t.co/pfPigscHKl,2020-02-11 18:20:04,Sprout Social,2,13
@realDonaldTrump called on Congress to pass legislation allowing angel families to sue when their loved ones are killed by an illegal immigrant being shielded by a sanctuary city. He said it best America should be a sanctuary for law abiding citizens and I agree with him 100%. https://t.co/gONubN1f6O,2020-02-10 21:53:16,Sprout Social,0,3
AOC and her “Squad” are pressuring banks to not work with legitimate companies like our Kentucky coal industry and I am doing everything I can to fight back.

@realDonaldTrump has unveiled a historic plan to bring about peace between Israel and Palestine.

Last night @realDonaldTrump gave his best #SOTU speech yet.

Last week I was proud to introduce a bipartisan bill requiring Congress to receive an annual report on America’s financial health.

Democrats failed to make their case in the Senate and it is time to move on from this impeachment hoax once and for all.

Impeachment was never about upholding the rule of law it was about overturning the 2016 election. Democrats may have gotten what they wanted but we can't let that discourage us. It is up to us to fight back harder than ever in 2020 and stop this lawlessness from happening again. https://t.co/dBU9AclkWi,2020-02-01 21:12:04,Sprout Social,2,14

I’ve heard from countless Kentuckians and small businesses what tax reform has meant to them. Wages are rising families are paying less taxes and businesses are hiring.
