One year ago @JoeBiden said that our country was not ready for a public health risk like COVID-19. Under this President’s failed leadership our country now faces the biggest case counts since the outbreak began. It didn’t have to be this bad. #vote https://t.co/unMm9vLrte,2020-10-25 13:48:34,Twitter for iPhone,2,3
This President doesn’t acknowledge that our frontline workers are essential to fight COVID-19.
