#COVID testing cannot be limited just to those that show symptoms or those who can afford it.

A decision by local health insurance companies to back away from #COVID testing coverage will make WNY a sicker place in the long run resulting in higher costs for all payers. This is an abdication of their responsibility to their customers and our community as a whole. https://t.co/V9oc9LfsCl,2020-08-25 22:53:13,Twitter Web App,16,67
This Administration's failure to lead on a national testing plan is now compounded by the creation of a loophole allowing private insurance companies to get away with not covering #COVID testing in some circumstances.

We fought to include funds for state and local governments in the emergency relief pkg. The GOP refused. Today Sen. McConnell actually said he is okay with our states and communities declaring bankruptcy. SHAMEFUL! https://t.co/nxFtNEmKiu,2020-04-22 23:33:27,Twitter Web App,1,2
Democrats fought hard to include funding for local governments &amp; school districts in the #COVID19 relief pkg because of the critical services they provide the public like police fire teachers utility workers &amp; others on the front lines.

On the first #EarthDay over 20 million Americans took to their communities passionately saying that industrial pollution of our air water and land was unacceptable. Let this 50th anniversary remind us of our duty to responsible environmental stewardship https://t.co/CqqHkmA4pJ,2020-04-22 15:57:02,Twitter Media Studio,5,6
The Clean Air &amp; Clean Water Acts came to be shortly after the first #EarthDay 50 years ago because an engaged public demanded it. I stand with @Cleanairwny &amp; the 50 organizations supporting efforts to hold @EPA accountable for its failure to enforce federal environmental laws. https://t.co/6BIQc0JyCZ,2020-04-21 17:07:04,Twitter Web App,3,7
Polluted air contributes to pre-existing conditions increasing the risk of serious health complications during emergencies like #COVID19. The @EPA is walking away from its responsibility to enforce policies in place to protect our air water and food. We are fighting back. https://t.co/iir44DV089,2020-04-21 17:05:00,Twitter Web App,1,4

As we work to combat #COVID19 we must also ensure the continued protection of our environment. Last month the @EPA ceased all enforcement actions after nearly 100 environmental rule rollbacks. Today on the eve of #EarthDay we sent a letter warning of the danger of this policy. https://t.co/kX9MhXLRwt,2020-04-21 15:58:22,Twitter Web App,11,19
