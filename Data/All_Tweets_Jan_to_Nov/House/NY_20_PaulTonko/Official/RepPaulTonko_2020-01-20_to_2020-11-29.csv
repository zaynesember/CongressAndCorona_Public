The Trump Administration is proposing to throw Americans off of #SocialSecurity despite the fact that they EARN these benefits! This is why I joined more than 100 of my colleagues to call on them to halt this nightmarish proposal. #NoSocialSecurityCuts https://t.co/xEsSQ8zXlA,2020-01-30 20:21:00,TweetDeck,6,21
The Trump Administration's #SocialSecurity disability rule would make it harder for people to keep benefits they need &amp; deserve.

Schools should be a safe place for every student to grow and learn. But for many particularly LGBTQ youths bullying &amp; name-calling is a part of life.

Millions of Americans rely on drinking water systems contaminated with #PFAS. H.R. 535 the PFAS Action Plan now passed in the House would reduce human &amp; environmental exposure to these dangerous substances and help cleanup of contaminated water systems.
