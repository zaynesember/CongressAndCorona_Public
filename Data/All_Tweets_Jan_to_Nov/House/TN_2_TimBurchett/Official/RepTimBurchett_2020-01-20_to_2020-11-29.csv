ICYMI: No federal budget should allow federal bureaucrats to abuse taxpayer dollars as their personal slush fund. I asked OMB Director @RussVought45 what the President's budget proposal does to eliminate wasteful fraudulent spending during yesterday's @housebudgetGOP hearing. https://t.co/lAsxiD28d4,2020-02-13 16:34:22,Twitter Media Studio,7,31
Small Business Committee members joined Small Business Development Center leaders from around the country to discuss topics ranging from trade to economic development in underserved communities.

I'm an original cosponsor of the Trillion Trees Act. Great piece of legislation that focuses on planting and maintaining forests to reduce carbon levels. The best part: it creates jobs instead of destroying our economy. Thanks @RepWesterman for introducing! https://t.co/2pCzUwzRgT,2020-02-12 19:46:25,Twitter Web App,11,35
Achievable reasonable priorities for America are clear in President Trump's budget. On the other hand Democrats are either too afraid or unwilling to draft a budget explaining how much of your money they want to spend on their socialist pie in the sky programs.,2020-02-12 16:45:43,Twitter for iPhone,11,48
The President's budget proposal:  ✅Fights the opioid epidemic ✅Strengthens our military and borders ✅Invests in economic growth of rural areas  It does not:  ❌Enable improper end of year spending on seafood dinners golf carts etc ❌Fund one size fits all government programs,2020-02-12 15:56:22,Twitter for iPhone,8,45
.@RussVought45 testifying before @housebudgetGOP on President Trump's budget proposal. Democrats complain about the proposal yet they will likely fail to produce their own budget. Are they nervous to reveal the true cost of their out of touch policies like the Green New Deal?,2020-02-12 15:23:01,Twitter Web App,5,25
Joined my @housebudgetGOP colleagues at the Office of Budget and Management to hear about the President's budget proposal. Appreciate the administration drafting a budget. Congress is supposed to do the same but by all indications we are going to again ignore that responsibility. https://t.co/ACHBAdQzpK,2020-02-11 18:31:05,Twitter Web App,11,63
The $4.67 billion disaster relief bill voted on by the House was misleading because the funds aren’t exclusively for Puerto Rico. Rather than a vote to throw more money at the problem we should’ve started by managing the $8 billion in disaster funds we’ve already appropriated.,2020-02-07 17:55:05,Twitter Web App,6,34
More excellent news for the American economy! Job creation beats expectations while wages continue to rise! https://t.co/VwZpatVa32,2020-02-07 16:48:06,Twitter Web App,6,53
Our federal government responded to recent disasters in Puerto Rico by directing HUD to release over $8 billion in disaster aid. This was just a few weeks ago. We need to see if this relief is working before Congress votes to spend billions more.,2020-02-07 15:24:50,Twitter Web App,4,50
The Puerto Rican government did the right thing by firing these officials for stashing away much needed disaster aid but before authorizing more funding Congress needs assurance that this kind of negligence won’t happen again. https://t.co/EEHb9iG0Zt,2020-02-07 14:46:14,Twitter Web App,6,30

I believe in capitalism and the free market. Socialism is dangerous and Venezuela's recent history makes that clear. Juan Guaido attending the State of the Union last night sent a powerful message that the United States will stand up to socialist tyranny around the world.,2020-02-05 20:53:07,Twitter Web App,9,88

It was an honor to receive the Tennessee Alzheimer’s Leadership Award.

I was to saddened to hear during today's Subcommittee on Europe Eurasia Energy and the Environment hearing that anti-Semitism in Europe is on the rise. As we honor the lives lost during the Holocaust this week we must remember anti-Semitism is unacceptable wherever it occurs. https://t.co/n3FIREGpuQ,2020-01-29 23:23:17,Twitter Media Studio,6,48

This report shows the need to limit how much Congress can spend. My legislation the RAFT Act limits public debt to an amount less than total GDP. This puts a check on Congress preventing politicians from overspending and spiraling our county into further debt.,2020-01-29 15:03:59,Twitter Web App,3,19
The CBO report states public debt is currently 81% of total GDP. It will reach 98% by 2030 and 180% by 2050. Congress's spending habits are out of control and we cannot continue spending taxpayer dollars as if they are unlimited.,2020-01-29 15:03:59,Twitter Web App,11,35
The Trump Administration’s Middle East peace plan announcement is a step in the right direction and I hope it leads to productive talks between the Israelis and Palestinians. I’ll review the plan as more details are released.,2020-01-28 19:55:35,Twitter Web App,6,45

Americans who are owed past-due compensation from the Social Security Administration often wait for payment while their attorney's are quickly paid. This is a troubling trend.
