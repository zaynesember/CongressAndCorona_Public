We need to fix &amp; build on the ACA—not tear it apart.https://t.co/qOvy2CC79Y,2020-10-25 15:53:40,Twitter for Android,8,27
I was honored to attend the Jennie Dean Memorial Statue unveiling in Manassas. Her advocacy for the Black community especially for children and their education has left a lasting gift for #VA10.  May her life and legacy continue to be a blessing and an inspiration to us all. https://t.co/lnFk3HXcUF,2020-10-24 19:16:40,Twitter for iPhone,7,64
Child care is absolutely essential for a full strong economic recovery.  I'm so pleased @GovernorVA is using federal #CARESAct funding to help providers stay afloat and reopen safely. https://t.co/weSVFQI91C,2020-10-23 19:05:05,Twitter for iPhone,6,22
The Trump admin’s new EO is an attack on the integrity of our civil service &amp; allows fed workers to be fired for political purposes.  These civil servants have spent their careers carrying out the essential work of government—regardless of who is president.https://t.co/xWatnA8puz,2020-10-23 15:24:35,Twitter for iPhone,8,23

#COVID19 has caused a "she-cession" threatening decades of progress for women in the workforce.   That's why I'm supporting a #MomsBailout like funding to help our schools and child care centers reopen safely and take the burden off of working moms. https://t.co/Q0iyGO74BF,2020-10-22 18:33:57,Twitter for iPhone,6,30
"Pre-existing condition" is not a political buzzword. If not for protections in the ACA many #VA10 families could be kicked off their health insurance.

I heard these concerns from businesses during my visits across #VA10.

I enjoyed the @DullesChamber Executive Women's Panel tonight where we discussed women's equality in the political &amp; business sectors in #VA10.

My next stop today is the historic John Wesley Methodist Episcopal Church founded in 1891 by Waterford’s black community.

The new #TrumpBudget would end subsidized student loans &amp; totally eliminate the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program—making the burden of debt even worse for students.

We may not always agree on everything but the only way we're going to find solutions to the issues that matter to #VA10—like affordable health care &amp; gun violence prevention—is through open dialogue like we had at my Haymarket town hall last weekend. https://t.co/U8LQn8HPEf,2020-02-14 17:24:43,Twitter for iPhone,11,31
I sent my boys off to school this morning thinking of the families in Parkland who probably had an almost identical morning routine to ours.

Virginia women persevered making our commonwealth the 38th &amp; final state to ratify the #ERA.  And today @RepSpeier's resolution that makes clear equality has no deadline just PASSED the House!

We need the #ERA to ensure that “Equal Justice Under Law” is a constitutional right for women—not just an inscription over the entrance to the Supreme Court.  Today I cast my vote in support of equality &amp; in recognition of the tireless work of so many over the years.  #ERANow https://t.co/GqZ1j2128w,2020-02-13 15:46:30,Twitter Web App,41,161

More than 700000 of our neighbors across the river in DC are denied the right to full representation in our federal government.

The President's budget is meant to be a statement of values—and the #TrumpBudget seeks to slash $1 trillion for Medicaid &amp; ACA subsidies jeopardizing health care for millions.

When Lt. Col. Vindman testified during the impeachment inquiry he spoke about his father who fled the Soviet Union saying "Do not worry I will be fine for telling the truth."

The rising cost of prescription drugs is a dire issue.  Rationing insulin or switching to less effective over-the-counter medication can end in tragedy—as it did for #VA10 resident Josh Wilkerson.

I'm proud we were able to secure paid parental leave for all federal employees—something @RepMaloney @RepDonBeyer @LeaderHoyer &amp; I led the charge on early last year.

I'm pleased that @GovernorVA has announced new investment into affordable housing including funding that will support seniors here in #VA10.  Accessible and affordable housing is key to ensuring that everyone in our community can live work &amp; succeed. https://t.co/MXKnl6FcIP,2020-02-01 20:19:24,Twitter for Android,7,35
A trial without witnesses is not a fair trial—it is a sham.   With damning information still coming to light the refusal to hear new witnesses or allow new evidence by the Senate is a dereliction of duty and a cover-up of the President's abuse of power. https://t.co/s87nVjKs7Q,2020-01-31 22:59:20,Twitter for iPhone,36,167
I'm excited to have Walewska Watkins a #VA10 mom and health care advocate join me as my #SOTU guest!  I'm going to keep fighting alongside Walewska her son Aire and the @LittleLobbyists to bring down the cost of care for all Virginia families. https://t.co/qCNdxLdyyY,2020-01-31 20:37:38,Twitter for iPhone,26,53

The Trump administration's Medicaid block grant plan could jeopardize coverage and access to health care for the most vulnerable Americans.  I joined @HouseDemocrats to fight back against this harmful proposal. https://t.co/oKnOdyVO5x,2020-01-30 22:28:58,Twitter for iPhone,10,25
Today by voting to repeal the 2002 AUMF the House is making it clear in a bipartisan way that any authorization of war—including with Iran—must come from Congress as set forth in Article I of the Constitution. https://t.co/CtUrDJVALO,2020-01-30 19:18:17,Twitter for iPhone,4,13
I had a busy day of hearings markup and votes yesterday in Washington so I’m glad my staff was able to join AG @MarkHerringVA &amp; law enforcement from Fairfax &amp; Arlington at @rodefshalom to discuss how our community can fight back against anti-Semitism and hate-fueled violence. https://t.co/jNPsa3MpDu,2020-01-30 15:29:04,Twitter for iPhone,6,12
Right now the deck is stacked against consumers who often feel helpless and at the mercy of #creditreporting agencies.  That's why tonight I voted to help reform the credit reporting industry and provide greater protections for consumers.  #ConsumersFirst https://t.co/gNYBOjSfXs,2020-01-30 00:40:26,Twitter for iPhone,50,222

Last year we won a major victory by securing a pay raise for our federal workforce but that's not the end of the road.  The federal government's greatest asset is its people. I'm an original cosponsor of the FAIR Act to help ensure federal workers get paid what they deserve. https://t.co/NhyAvsaF1w,2020-01-29 15:13:37,Twitter for iPhone,6,15
In the middle of a busy day on the Hill I’m glad I could speak with Esra &amp; Marlien from the Congress-Bundestag Youth Exchange. They’re both studying in #VA10 all the way from Germany! Programs like these help strengthen international bonds &amp; promote global partnership. 🇺🇸🇩🇪 https://t.co/pQCMb6MTXj,2020-01-29 01:36:16,Twitter for iPhone,8,26
The House has joined the legal fight against the Trump administration's changes to #SNAP work requirements which could cut nearly 700000 Americans off from basic food assistance.  It's a cruel &amp; counterproductive policy—and we will fight it. #HandsOffSNAP https://t.co/BOcAdrk9aY,2020-01-28 21:07:54,Twitter for iPhone,20,48
Today @WaysMeansCmte is holding a hearing on the #FAMILYAct which would create a comprehensive &amp; inclusive national paid leave standard.

When I heard there would be Brownies at my office today this isn't what I expected—but I was pleasantly surprised!  It was great to welcome @girlscouts Troop 52003 to Capitol Hill to discuss what it's like being in Congress and our favorite Girl Scout cookies (mine are Samoas!) https://t.co/8ToQzUVTqn,2020-01-27 23:25:00,Twitter for iPhone,12,64

3 years ago today Trump announced his #MuslimBan.  So the next day I joined neighbors in #VA10 at @Dulles_Airport to protest that discriminatory ban.  Now—in Congress—I'm proud to cosponsor the #NoBanAct to bar discrimination on the basis of religion in the issuance of visas. https://t.co/gYolJLvKtg,2020-01-27 19:43:47,Twitter for iPhone,31,102
Today marks 75 years since the liberation of Auschwitz.  #WeRemember one of the darkest chapters in human history—the murder of millions including 6 million Jews.  With anti-semitism on the rise we must stand together against hate in all its forms and say #NeverAgain. https://t.co/O5FxMqq1AE,2020-01-27 16:03:13,Twitter for iPhone,11,57

I'm joining the @LGBTEqCaucus and @GLSEN for #NoNameCallingWeek to stand up against bullying and discrimination in all its forms.  School is tough enough as it is—none of our kids should have to grapple with bullying on top of everything else.   Let's practice #KindnessInAction. https://t.co/3GvTj3xAL7,2020-01-24 22:14:00,Twitter for Android,12,24

Failing to renew this emergency declaration is inexcusable when lives are at stake.  But beyond that if the Trump administration was serious about ending the opioid epidemic they wouldn't be fighting in court to repeal the ACA with no replacement. https://t.co/5NLHCz0vVA,2020-01-24 18:09:56,Twitter for iPhone,14,35

Today I visited Highway Motors a family-owned commercial truck dealership in Winchester.

47 years after #RoevWade access to abortion is under greater threat than ever before—from the Trump administration unconstitutional abortion bans and stacked courts.

The House is ready to present its case to the American people.  If the Senate chooses to prevent witness testimony to block new document evidence—then they are conducting a cover-up not a trial.  The American people deserve the truth. https://t.co/MmqIbAYOgs,2020-01-21 23:16:25,Twitter for iPhone,39,141
10 years ago the disastrous SCOTUS #CitizensUnited decision allowed unlimited dark money to seep into our elections.   I voted for #HR1 the #ForThePeople Act to help put an end to corruption in Washington &amp; return power to the people—it's time for the Senate to act. https://t.co/esOEiXprHG,2020-01-21 16:00:53,Twitter for iPhone,28,69
Can’t think of a better way to end my #MLKDayofService than with @NVFS.
