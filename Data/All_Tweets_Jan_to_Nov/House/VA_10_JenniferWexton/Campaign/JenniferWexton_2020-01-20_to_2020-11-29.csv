This President continues to deny the truth and misrepresent the situation on the ground.  And as a result refuses to take any meaningful action.  Meanwhile the toll on American lives and livelihoods increases daily. https://t.co/FmEM0XglOd,2020-05-11 23:42:35,Twitter for iPhone,5,42

1. I will never let @MarkWarner make a tuna melt sandwich in my presence. 🤚 2.

Taking Wanda and Lady Bear out for a walk with Andrew is one of the ways I stay centered right now.   As we all #StayHome make sure you’re looking after yourself too.

If voting by mail is good enough for Donald Trump it's good enough for the American people.  No one should have to choose between their health and their right to vote—and I'm going to make sure of it. https://t.co/IL5mAhVZJ7,2020-04-09 16:27:33,Twitter for iPhone,76,283
Lines around the block to vote during a global pandemic—this is voter disenfranchisement and it's dangerous.  We need a plan in place so that every American can cast their ballot without having to risk their health and safety. https://t.co/WSMryPL8M3,2020-04-07 15:23:43,Twitter for iPhone,39,86

Millions of Americans don't have health insurance in the midst of the worst global pandemic we've faced in decades &amp; this is the Trump administration's response.  Access to affordable health care is lifesaving—especially right now. https://t.co/bkto8ufzZg,2020-04-01 18:37:02,Twitter for Android,32,47
These numbers are sobering for anyone. No one is immune to this virus and we all know someone who is especially vulnerable.

It’s heartbreaking that this discussion has to take place in our communities.  We need more ventilators we need more masks we need more tests.  Use the Defense Production Act @realDonaldTrump.   Lives are at stake. https://t.co/8BpLprufcU,2020-03-25 20:28:57,Twitter for iPhone,32,58
My mom Paula is not expendable.  Neither are your parents. Or your children. Or your siblings.  We aren't trading human lives for a stronger stock market.

Trump was asked if he’d rethink his lawsuit to repeal the ACA in its entirety given that we’re in the midst of a pandemic.  He refused despite the fact that if he wins 20 million Americans could lose coverage &amp; 135 million would lose protections for preexisting conditions. https://t.co/YgNwKWvoNl,2020-03-22 23:49:52,Twitter for iPhone,14,32

We need leadership driven by facts and science—a President who will tell us the truth and take responsibility.   That President is @JoeBiden.  From a month ago: https://t.co/PTg3IYJzjM,2020-03-21 16:08:24,Twitter for iPhone,19,99
I’m hearing from constituents every day whose livelihoods are in jeopardy whose loved ones are at serious risk from this virus—it’s disgraceful that any public servant would take deliberate steps to profit off this crisis. https://t.co/MWU96ieiPk,2020-03-20 18:51:44,Twitter for iPhone,16,59

Hey @senatemajldr I didn’t know the Senate took weekends off during pandemics?  We just passed #FamiliesFirst in the House to get urgent emergency relief to American families ASAP.  Get to work &amp; send this bill to the President’s desk.,2020-03-14 13:43:59,Twitter for iPhone,79,241
I'm having serious trouble understanding what's so controversial about: ▶️Free testing for #COVID19 ▶️Paid sick leave ▶️Food security for our kids ▶️Enhanced unemployment insurance  What's the hold up @realDonaldTrump?   We can’t afford to wait—we need to put #FamiliesFirst.,2020-03-14 00:36:21,Twitter for iPhone,28,129
It shouldn't take a pandemic to bring paid sick leave to the forefront of the national discourse.  We should be proactive about implementing common-sense legislation that protects our families.  RT if you agree. #FamiliesFirst  https://t.co/JT1Z5lIyLd,2020-03-13 00:43:59,Twitter for iPhone,24,52

The lack of testing capacity is severely undermining our ability to prevent the spread of coronavirus—and the President didn't even bother to address it.  Where are the tests Mr. President? Every American deserves to know.   Lives are at stake.,2020-03-12 02:11:49,Twitter for iPhone,61,222
Important PSA: coronavirus has absolutely nothing to do with race nationality or ethnicity and the xenophobia and misinformation being spread to suggest otherwise is harmful and dangerous.  It's important we spread facts—not fear—about this serious public health threat.,2020-03-12 00:45:04,Twitter for Android,122,375

Here’s what’s at stake this November: 135 million Americans with pre-existing conditions will lose protections &amp; 20 million Americans could lose coverage.

.@JoeBiden knows that rebuilding &amp; investing in our federal agencies must be a top priority.

I voted to pass universal background checks a year ago today and since then there have been 40000 firearm deaths in America.  Doing nothing—as @senatemajldr has—is cowardice.  By refusing a vote Mitch McConnell is showing that he works for the @NRA not the American people. https://t.co/d2k8vJx3kL,2020-02-28 01:20:24,Twitter for Android,19,43
This murder should spark outrage everywhere.   Her name was Alexa Negrón Luciano and her story is too common in America.

I want to know what our next President will do to strengthen &amp; rebuild the federal workforce after 4 years of Donald Trump.

The next President will be the CEO of America's largest employer—the federal government.  Nine #DemDebates and there hasn't been a single question about how our candidates will manage that workforce.  America should know how a President will run the federal government.,2020-02-20 04:02:23,Twitter for iPhone,39,201
An hour and a half into the ninth #DemDebate but still no discussion of gun violence prevention.   Gun violence is a crisis in America and we need to hear what the next President will do about it.   #DemocraticDebate,2020-02-20 03:29:47,Twitter for iPhone,104,491
Happy #PresidentsDay to one of the people who first inspired me to run for elected office @BarackObama!  Your vision of hope and change showed us that we each have a role to play in making our country a better place for all Americans. https://t.co/lkRHHEpdQQ,2020-02-17 20:19:45,Twitter for Android,11,228
To win in 2020 Virginians of all different backgrounds identities and from every part of our Commonwealth will need to unite.  Working together we're going to keep Virginia blue and beat Donald Trump.  Nothing less than the future of our democracy is at stake.  #BCG2020 https://t.co/ILNOvbOQCc,2020-02-16 03:37:08,Twitter for iPhone,50,186
Two years ago after the Parkland shooting I expressed my frustration that every gun safety bill had been killed in the General Assembly.  But after we couldn't change minds we changed their seats—and this year Virginia passed major gun safety legislation.  Change is possible. https://t.co/4MYKiEUBX4,2020-02-14 18:44:12,Twitter for Android,46,174
Happy #GalentinesDay to @JennMcClellanVA &amp; @JCarrollFoy Virginia's #ERA patrons!  With today's U.S. House vote the decades-long fight to #RatifyERA &amp; finally guarantee equal rights for women in the Constitution is one step closer to reality.  Jennifers get stuff done. https://t.co/e3l3YhcQ0R,2020-02-13 19:12:34,Twitter for Android,17,83
It's great to see @itsgabrielleu and @DwyaneWade speaking out in support of their daughter Zaya for proudly being who she is.  Every kid deserves parents who will support them no matter how they identify. https://t.co/sIjjTE4Tyy,2020-02-12 14:45:56,Twitter for Android,4,45

Representation matters. My friend @pwcdanica is a voice and inspiration for so many young people who face discrimination just because of who they are.  We're so lucky to have Danica fighting for ALL Virginians in Richmond.  You go girl! https://t.co/524D1twsld,2020-02-06 14:56:52,Twitter for Android,54,332
Today we saw a bipartisan vote to convict the President—and a partisan vote to acquit him.  History will not look kindly on those who condoned the President's abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. https://t.co/WdYbUykXG8,2020-02-06 01:59:48,Twitter for iPhone,9,64
If you didn't like what you heard at the #SOTU if you want to reject the politics of fear and division—then make sure your friends and family are registered to VOTE in 2020. https://t.co/Sfmw3m4Mc9,2020-02-05 04:03:03,Twitter for iPhone,48,124
Next year I want to hear from a President who recognizes that trans rights are human rights and who will prioritize equality for all Americans in their administration. #SOTU 🏳️‍🌈,2020-02-05 03:35:40,Twitter for Android,69,490
If the President was serious about making health care more affordable he would not be in court right now trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act. #SOTU,2020-02-05 03:13:14,Twitter for Android,83,252
I can't afford to buy an ad for the #SuperBowl but if I could I would remind America that @realDonaldTrump and the @GOP are trying to take away your health care and every Democrat—in the House Senate and who is running for President—is fighting to protect it.,2020-02-03 00:33:29,Twitter for iPhone,686,1915

I'm honored to have the endorsement of @GiffordsCourage for my reelection campaign!  We've already passed the most robust gun safety agenda in decades here in the House—including universal background checks—but there's more work to do to keep our kids and communities safe. https://t.co/jg2P7A9ImF,2020-01-29 17:10:03,Twitter for Android,32,155
I had a great time speaking with the Young Dems at Handley High and I was so impressed by their thoughtfulness and genuine passion for the issues.  Civic engagement &amp; community organizing are how we're going to tackle the most pressing issues facing #VA10—these students get it! https://t.co/jfaauMUyQe,2020-01-23 23:28:50,Twitter for Android,11,56
