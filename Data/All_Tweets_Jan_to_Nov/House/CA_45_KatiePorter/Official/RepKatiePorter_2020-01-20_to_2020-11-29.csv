During the hearing I asked Mr. DeJoy if he’d resign if an independent watchdog found he violated conflict of interest law. He scoffed.  I’m following up because the American people need to know that the Postmaster General has their interests at heart not his own. (3/3),2020-09-10 17:49:11,Twitter Web App,646,3044
Federal law prohibits government employees from financially benefiting from their position.

The COVID-19 crisis is a stark reminder of our country's lack of investment in our kids. Affordable and quality childcare is especially important for gender equality (not to mention our economy!) and it can make life a smidge easier for single parents like me. 😉👩‍👧‍👦,2020-07-16 23:30:36,Twitter Web App,255,2251

Today we found out that President Trump's @USOCC has been looking the other way as banks discriminated against minority homebuyers. In at least SIX cases the agency that is supposed to be in charge of reining in banks instead swept racism under the rug.  https://t.co/9Br7BsjYV8,2020-07-13 23:43:32,Twitter Web App,398,1081
Last year I questioned President Trump's then-head of @USOCC Joseph Otting who said he had “personally never observed” discrimination but was told it exists by “friends from the inner city.” That same agency failed to investigate banks’ racist practices. https://t.co/kIx0SJOazJ,2020-07-13 23:43:32,Twitter Web App,590,2068

Here are the facts:  1) President Trump has the authority to use the DPA to meet a number of critical needs—including #COVID19 tests.  2) Congress allocated $1B to the DPA fund for that exact reason.  3) 40000 Americans died before President Trump used the DPA to order tests.,2020-04-21 19:34:42,Twitter for iPhone,5792,14206
Throughout this pandemic I’ve heard from small businesses in Orange County that they need help and they need it quick.

The American people need to have confidence that their taxpayer dollars will support working families and not line the pockets of big corporations.

I've seen many comments expressing frustration with the inadequacy of the "Rent Assist" option and I agree. That's why my office worked with IC to publicize the hardship exemption.

During this pandemic food security and scarcity are frightening issues. Farmworkers are maintaining our food supply and they need PPE safe working conditions and fair pay.

Strictly sheltering in place is one way we can all take care of each other during this uniquely stressful time.

This company claimed that its booster seat was "side impact tested" but the tests actually revealed that their product performed poorly. https://t.co/CzyTcnpRNt,2020-02-12 22:54:19,Twitter Web App,412,1993
Being a public servant requires you to put the country's best interests above your own. The American people must have confidence in the independence of the Fed especially as the President seeks to unduly pressure the Chair to change interests rates. https://t.co/9R1CTh0u8a,2020-02-11 19:35:14,Twitter Web App,658,2206
The Chair of the Federal Reserve is the top official responsible for our country's economic well-being. Partying with the ultra-wealthy creates the appearance that those billionaires have an unfair opportunity to weigh in on economic policy decisions. https://t.co/HslCpHpNI2,2020-02-11 19:34:46,Twitter Media Studio,2372,8693
We know in Orange County that wonderful museums and libraries help make our community a great place to live. This move by the Administration runs contrary to our OC values. I am a staunch supporter of efforts to #FundLibraries. https://t.co/HMsUZNzUf0,2020-02-10 23:18:40,Twitter Web App,401,1352
I’m thankful for @GavinNewsom's leadership in establishing a new consumer protection agency for our state and I look forward to being a partner at the federal level to protect working families from corporate abuse. https://t.co/6vZCKqJXz8,2020-02-10 17:13:20,Twitter Web App,490,2722
Happy 110th birthday @boyscouts! As a proud Scout Mom and adult leader I want to shout out all Scout parents and volunteers who mentor our next generation of leaders. https://t.co/4XlIGoQzl2,2020-02-08 21:31:55,Twitter for iPhone,148,2652
Corporate abuse is insidious like this: tax preparation companies deceive consumers into paying for products they can access for free.  That’s why I stood up to leaders of both parties when they tried to fast-track a bill to make it easier for these companies to cheat consumers. https://t.co/h6d77t7NW3,2020-02-07 23:37:51,Twitter for iPhone,441,1753
@donmoyn I’ve read some articles citing your research—but this weekend I’m reading your book. 📚📚  Hearings are to educate Congress and when witnesses have no answers I will keep working to understand problems and find solutions.,2020-02-07 22:59:12,Twitter for iPhone,36,469
This week we recognize National Gun Violence Survivors Week because it’s about the time of year that gun deaths in the U.S. exceed the *yearly* total of our peer countries.  It’s past time for the Senate and the President to turn gun violence prevention legislation into law.,2020-02-07 20:02:37,Twitter Web App,257,1372
Our Founders envisioned the House as the chamber closest to the people. I have a duty to hold special interests and government officials accountable to everyday Americans. It's a responsibility I take seriously and it's one of my top priorities in Congress. /end thread,2020-02-07 03:08:24,Twitter Web App,492,4067
Finally I sat in on a @FSCDems Oversight Subcommittee hearing—even though I'm not on this subcommittee. I spotlighted an incident last year where a financial watchdog cited phony comments submitted to him to defend his rollback of shareholder protections. https://t.co/rN0KADwHSz,2020-02-07 03:08:24,Twitter Web App,367,2238
Then I participated in a @FSCDems hearing with our nation's top consumer protection official. She's been emphasizing financial education for consumers instead of holding bad actors accountable. I questioned whether she was up to her own task. https://t.co/J99PEUfVOG,2020-02-07 03:08:23,Twitter Web App,320,2177
First we had a hearing in @OversightDems where I highlighted research that documents how burdensome application requirements often stop eligible Americans from getting the benefits they qualify for. https://t.co/ddjsZPjVqq,2020-02-07 03:08:23,Twitter Web App,215,1824
We had a late night voting on the House floor so I wanted to provide an update on what's been a busy day. I participated in three hearings—including one held by a subcommittee I don't serve on—to conduct oversight on a variety of topics. Mini-thread 👇👇👇,2020-02-07 03:08:23,Twitter Web App,958,5604

Last year a top financial watchdog announced the rollback of protections that empower shareholders to hold executives accountable. He cited supportive comments submitted by everyday Americans—which turned out to be fake.  I dug into this at a hearing today.

This is corporate abuse plain and simple. The American people deserve answers from @EvenfloBaby on why they put their profits before our kids' lives. https://t.co/DdMTt1WjYV,2020-02-06 22:14:24,Twitter Web App,262,648
Here’s what the research shows: increasing the administrative burden on working Americans such as excessive paperwork requirements decreases the number of people who access the benefits they deserve—even if they’re eligible. https://t.co/0LWLSXNOBJ,2020-02-06 20:44:33,Twitter for iPhone,5646,19905
This is especially concerning because under her leadership our nation's top consumer watchdog has prioritized "financial education" over policing bad actors. https://t.co/3i9GApelFB,2020-02-06 19:26:11,Twitter Web App,495,1914
When I questioned @CFPBDirector today she admitted that she doesn't know basic facts about reverse mortgages.  How can we trust her to educate the public about this financial product—one that can be particularly confusing for consumers—if she isn't able to offer these answers? https://t.co/F4SaqArrzI,2020-02-06 19:26:11,Twitter Web App,3449,12911
There's been a lot of chatter about what the President said in his wide-ranging #SOTU last night but let's talk about what was left out.  In his 1hr18min speech there was not a single mention of corruption or "draining the swamp."  I discuss @Lawrence on @TheLastWord &gt;&gt; https://t.co/DF8BWOE8Oy,2020-02-05 20:38:51,Twitter Web App,544,2334
🚨 @realDonaldTrump announced support for #HR3 🚨  In #SOTU he called for “bipartisan legislation that achieves the goal of dramatically lowering prescription drug prices” and he “will sign it into law without delay.”  HR3 passed with bipartisan support in 2019. #HR3withoutdelay https://t.co/rXi8S4KbCr,2020-02-05 05:57:05,Twitter for iPhone,1201,4162
As the President gives his #SOTU address I'm listening for his plan to improve our healthcare system including mental health coverage.

The Admin’s expanded travel ban emphasizes what our communities already know—this ban has always been about prejudice and xenophobia. That’s why visitors are allowed but not permanent immigrants. I’m glad the House will soon consider legislation to end this discriminatory policy.,2020-02-01 13:47:15,Twitter for iPhone,566,2672
The first Social Security check was issued 80 years ago today. As the population of older adults grows we can't abandon our commitment to their financial security.

Wow what an honor to be named Toughest Questioner in this 2019 roundup in the @washingtonpost!

Here’s the thing: if an Administration official is willing to tell media that “9 out of 10 banks” agree with their agenda then he should be willing to name names in a public hearing.

The head of @USOCC said in the press that anyone who doesn't like his proposal to water down a major anti-discrimination law is either corrupt or uneducated.  I don't agree with his proposal so I challenged him to say that to my face in a hearing.  Spoiler alert: he declined. https://t.co/MNJ8m4WkaM,2020-01-29 19:43:54,Twitter Web App,3396,15358

On the 47th anniversary of #RoevWade let's talk about what’s at stake when it comes to reproductive justice.
