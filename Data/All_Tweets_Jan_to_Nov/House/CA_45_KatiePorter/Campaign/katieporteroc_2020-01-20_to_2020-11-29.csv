@magnus1326 @ewarren @TeamWarren @magnus1326 I’m so glad that we agree on the need to reduce taxes on working parents. I introduced a bipartisan bill to allow families to save more tax free to pay for childcare so they can work. I hope you’ll encourage the President to support this bill HR 1985,2020-02-05 05:47:09,Twitter Web App,0,3
