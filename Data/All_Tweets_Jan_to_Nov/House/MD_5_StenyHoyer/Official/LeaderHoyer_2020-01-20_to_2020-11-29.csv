The disaster during this pandemic has been the President’s shameful mismanagement of this virus that has cost over 220000 American lives not Dr. Fauci.

I was on @MeetThePress with @ChuckTodd today to discuss COVID-relief negotiations. The GOP is divided on providing more relief but Americans need help now.

Four years ago Senator Shelby said that deciding the next Supreme Court Justice is such a critical decision that Americans should have a say.

The fight to expand and secure Medicare and Medicaid is not yet done. Neither is the work of making sure that every person in our country has access to quality affordable health care including those with disabilities. House Democrats will not rest until that task is finished.,2020-07-30 19:04:09,Twitter for iPhone,2,7
When the House passed legislation to create Medicare &amp; Medicaid in 1965 John Dingell had the honor of gaveling the vote closed. In 2012 he said of the gavel: “It’s a fine piece of wood &amp; its tasks in terms of dealing w/ the public’s concerns are not yet done.” He is right.,2020-07-30 19:04:09,Twitter for iPhone,1,7
As we celebrate 55 years since the enactment of Medicare and Medicaid we do so at a moment when making affordable health care accessible to more Americans is paramount in our thoughts. https://t.co/iQbmsTXlbZ,2020-07-30 19:04:09,Twitter for iPhone,0,10
The Dem-led House took action more than 10 weeks ago; the Senate GOP chose to wait &amp; see. As the crisis worsens they continue to dither and delay. We must move forward immediately with a robust legislative response.,2020-07-30 19:00:57,Twitter for iPhone,10,23

The GOP coronavirus bill is a typical Republican response to the American people. It says: "you're on your own." It mirrors Trump's failure to respond to this crisis. It is insufficient.

Systemic racism and police brutality have led to the murder of far too many Black men and women. By passing the #GeorgeFloyd #JusticeInPolicing House Democrats are saying: enough.

Mr. Yoho’s comments were beneath this institution. No woman should be confronted with this kind of attack.

They don't have a bill. They are wasting time fighting among themselves over how few people they should help during this crisis. That needs to stop. They need to do the right thing and take up the #HeroesAct or put up their alternative now. We don’t have time to delay. (3/3),2020-07-23 17:17:40,Twitter Web App,12,32
What happened while they stalled? Today we have rising infections rising deaths and rising unemployment claims. Republicans were betting on good news that never came and now we are facing an even more dire crisis. They need to own up to that. (2/3),2020-07-23 17:17:39,Twitter Web App,6,28
Due to their own internal divisions Republicans still don’t have a coronavirus relief proposal. The House passed the #HeroesAct 2 months ago.

Last year when we enacted a permanent reauthorization of the #LWCF we made it clear that doing so was only the first in a two-step process. The second step was permanent funding. That’s what this bill today will achieve.,2020-07-22 19:04:00,Twitter Web App,1,6
John Lewis understood that conserving America’s great outdoors and public spaces went part in parcel with protecting the legacy of civil rights.

Today the House passed @RepMaxineWaters's Emergency Housing Protections and Relief Act which will help protect Americans from foreclosures and evictions.

John Bolton should have testified before the House during its impeachment proceedings. Instead he withheld his damning evidence of the POTUS’s abuse of power preferring to enrich himself off a book deal. Shame on him. https://t.co/nV6UzBtDuB,2020-06-29 23:35:28,Twitter Web App,19,63
It is outrageous that POTUS has taken no action since our intelligence assessed Russia placed bounties on US troops in Afghanistan.

This blog post from @CenterOnBudget shows that House Democrats’ bill to strengthen the #ACA &amp; #LowerCostsForCare would benefit over 17 million Americans.

More than two-thirds of Americans agree the killing of George Floyd represents a broad problem in the treatment of African Americans by law enforcement. There is a clear need for reform which is why the House is advancing the #JusticeInPolicing Act. https://t.co/owd00Di9ly,2020-06-09 19:59:01,Twitter Web App,7,21
As the @WashingtonPost Editorial points out it is not unreasonable to demand high levels of responsibility and accountability of law enforcement. I hope Republicans will work with us to advance the #JusticeInPolicing Act and send it to POTUS's desk. https://t.co/9F51fAp8ba,2020-06-09 19:24:45,Twitter Web App,2,8
As Republicans use the jobs report as their latest excuse for inaction keep in mind the overall unemployment rate would likely be 16.3%.    Even at 13.3% it is far too high for the GOP to sit on their hands. I continue to urge the Senate to take up and pass the #HeroesAct. https://t.co/kcnOrb3kgf,2020-06-09 18:25:54,Twitter Web App,9,24
Lastly I said with unemployment rates at levels not seen since the Great Depression this is hardly the time for the Senate to sit on its hands and wait.

That’s why the House has continued to take action to help those out of work as a result of this pandemic with the #CARESAct and #HeroesAct. The Senate has yet to act on additional coronavirus legislation choosing instead to “pause” as millions of Americans are out of work.,2020-06-05 19:03:40,Twitter Web App,1,10
The #JobsReport suggests the number of Americans out of work was lower than expected but we face historically high joblessness and economic insecurity and state and local governments are being forced to lay off hundreds of thousands of workers. https://t.co/0HnvpXZJAY,2020-06-05 19:03:40,Twitter Web App,3,8

A report released by @JECDems details the importance of #CARESAct expanded UI benefits for families. If the benefit were to expire next month  the consequences could be devastating.

First the President said he had "total authority."    Then he said the Governors were on their own &amp; states must come up with their own way of producing the tens of millions of tests required to reopen the country.

During my #MakeItInAmerica Listening Tour in 2018 I sat down with local business owners educators and workers across the country and they all spoke to the importance of apprenticeships. House Dems listened and will respond by strengthening these critical programs.,2020-03-04 22:34:07,Twitter Web App,3,11
Apprenticeships are vitally important programs that help Americans develop the skill sets necessary to compete in today’s workforce. These programs also ensure that a pipeline of talented workers can fill good-paying jobs that are available.,2020-03-04 22:34:07,Twitter Web App,3,9
I thank the @EdLaborCmte for holding a hearing on the National Apprenticeship Act a proposal to create 1 million new apprenticeship opportunities. This is a key priority to help ensure that more of our people can #MakeItInAmerica. https://t.co/m7kUk9YHcb,2020-03-04 22:34:07,Twitter Web App,5,13

Lastly I said that tomorrow #SCOTUS will hear oral arguments in the June Medical Services v. Russo case. The law passed in LA is part of a GOP effort to undermine #RoevWade. I hope that the court will rule on the side of women as it has before &amp; maintain women’s right to choose.,2020-03-03 17:46:31,Twitter Web App,6,23
I also said that it is ironic that as we deal with the health &amp; safety of Americans the GOP-backed #ACA lawsuit is proceeding in #SCOTUS. If the GOP succeeds millions of Americans will lose coverage. Democrats will continue to defend the #ACA in Congress and in the courts.,2020-03-03 17:46:31,Twitter Web App,9,24
At my weekly press conference I told reporters the House is committed to a coordinated fully-funded response to the coronavirus. I expect we'll have a supplemental bill on the Floor soon.

It is disappointing the Senate GOP adjourned for the week without considering the Emmett Till Antilynching Act which would make lynching a federal hate crime. The bill passed the House with strong bipartisan support &amp; I hope they will take it up soon &amp; send it to POTUS's desk.,2020-02-28 16:34:31,Twitter Web App,48,109
I thank @TheBlackCaucus for working hard to ensure all communities respond to the #2020Census.

Today marks 1 year since the House passed #HR8. As I said then we need more than a moment of silence following acts of gun violence. We need action.

The Editorial Board makes a compelling point: “Will [Grenell] stand up against interference by Russia or other hostile powers?

This is the latest example of Trump's continued efforts to diminish our Intelligence Community. He fires anyone who shows independence &amp; puts in place individuals with no experience.

After Congress passed the Equal Rights Amendment I voted to ratify it in MD as a State Senator. The ERA was overdue then and it is overdue now. But it is never too late to do the right thing.

Taking the step to add the #ERA to the Constitution is one of the many that House Dems are taking to combat discrimination against women. We have:  ✅Passed the #PaycheckFairnessAct ✅ Passed #VAWA reauthorization ✅Continued to work to protect women's reproductive rights. https://t.co/pXmQnSnvBM,2020-02-13 18:48:37,Twitter Web App,9,18
For those who say gender discrimination isn't a problem: ❌The gender wage gap still persists ❌Women are at risk of being placed on leave or fired due to pregnancy ❌Reproductive health rights are under attack We need the #ERANow. I was proud to reaffirm my support for it today. https://t.co/Q3Jqy0mRDk,2020-02-13 17:59:38,Twitter Web App,14,37
Discrimination &amp; inequality persist &amp; as long as our Constitution does not explicitly ban discrimination based upon gender we will continue to see forms of discrimination against women linger in our country.

The House will vote today to remove the deadline for ratification of the #ERA &amp; move toward enshrining women’s equality in the Constitution. There is no time limit to do the right thing.

@RepSpeier Women still earn 82 cents to a man’s $. Women in the workforce are at risk of being placed on leave or being forced out of jobs if they become pregnant. Women’s access to health care continues to be threatened. These forms of discrimination testify to why we need the #ERANow.,2020-02-12 19:28:33,Twitter Web App,14,29
Tomorrow the House will pass @RepSpeier’s resolution to remove the arbitrary deadline of ratification of the #ERA. Doing so will provide more clarity that the ERA should become the 28th amendment. There shouldn’t be a time limit for doing the right thing. #ERANow https://t.co/QrV3izIbqk,2020-02-12 19:27:45,Twitter Media Studio,40,100

The #TrumpBudget is titled “A Budget for America’s Future” but its vision for that future is bleak. It envisions an America that is less than it can or should be. It envisions an America where working families are left to struggle while the wealthy continue to prosper. https://t.co/6r890aPo55,2020-02-12 17:08:53,Twitter Media Studio,12,32

Trump's budget would undermine health care Medicare &amp; Medicaid; slash nutrition assistance; divest in our infrastructure; &amp; harm our students. Despite deep cuts and fantasy economic projections it does not balance in 10 years. The #TrumpBudget contradicts his #SOTU promises.,2020-02-11 17:53:54,Twitter Web App,6,26
At my weekly press conference I was joined by @HouseBudgetDems Chair @RepJohnYarmuth to discuss the #TrumpBudget. This budget is what the "American carnage" Trump referenced in his inaugural address looks like &amp; is a manifestation of his broken promises to the American people.,2020-02-11 17:53:53,Twitter Web App,13,33
The #TrumpBudget relies on false assumptions about our economy reflecting the distorted vision laid out in his #SOTU &amp; is a roadmap for his destructive policies to cut Medicaid Medicare access to health care &amp; opportunity.

Last year both parties reached a bipartisan budget agreement that will govern this year’s topline spending levels. In addition to breaking the bipartisan budget agreement the #TrumpBudget is little more than a partisan wish-list full of Republicans’ worst ideas. That’s a shame.,2020-02-10 21:10:07,Twitter Web App,45,111
Rather than admit their policy failure the #TrumpBudget doubles down on this fantasy.  Yet even when coupled with the extreme spending cuts included in the President’s budget he still cannot overcome the massive deficits caused by his tax cuts to balance the budget.,2020-02-10 21:10:07,Twitter Web App,30,84
POTUS &amp; GOP allies promised that their tax cuts for the wealthiest would pay for themselves &amp; not cause higher deficits because the benefits directed toward the wealthy would eventually trickle down to workers &amp; boost economic activity. This #TrumpBudget makes no mention of them.,2020-02-10 21:10:06,Twitter Web App,26,59
The #TrumpBudget is a manifestation of #TrumpBrokenPromises to improve health care safeguard Medicare &amp; eliminate the debt. POTUS cuts Medicare Medicaid CHIP nutrition assistance student loan assistance &amp; other priorities to offset the deficits caused by the #GOPTaxScam.,2020-02-10 21:10:06,Twitter Web App,33,63
The #TrumpBudget is replete with dangerous proposals that leave working families to fend for themselves in a changing and uncertain economy.

The #JobsReport shows economic performance under POTUS is losing steam. He continues to mislead about his record but working Americans know the truth.

Today is a sad day for our republic. The Senate did not remove a president who abused his power.   This impeachment trial was not a fair one. Without hearing witnesses this could not be called a trial at all.    As a result Trump has not been exonerated. https://t.co/ctcTXMmDSB,2020-02-05 22:40:31,Twitter Web App,34,116
The #SOTU was not based on reality especially when it comes to the economy. The facts show Trump inherited the strong economy from President Obama &amp; that he has failed to help working Americans get ahead. Instead we’re seeing missed opportunities on jobs wages &amp; health care. https://t.co/K5cHfqFPrT,2020-02-05 22:12:06,Twitter Media Studio,33,61
When the House voted on impeachment articles I said the pages of our history are filled with Americans who had the courage to choose country over party.

The House impeached the President based upon our oath to #DefendOurDemocracy. If the Senate acquits POTUS Senators are failing to uphold their oaths to impartial justice and history will judge poorly those who choose fear of their party over the courage to do the right thing. https://t.co/b1mzlZs7NX,2020-02-05 20:34:45,Twitter Media Studio,28,66

Last night’s #SOTU was a missed opportunity to discuss issues we can work together on such as infrastructure and prescription drugs. Instead POTUS misled the American people and attempted to distract from his record of failing working families. https://t.co/GBrvMDJy7c,2020-02-05 20:08:47,Twitter Web App,11,23
Finally I said that a trial is not an opening statement and closing statement. Our House managers proved their case in the impeachment trial. I am deeply disappointed that Senators will vote to acquit today and not pursue their oath to impartiality.,2020-02-05 18:13:27,Twitter Web App,22,70

At my weekly press conference I told reporters that POTUS's address last night repeatedly misled the American people and attempted to distract from how his policies are failing working families.

Tonight @POTUS doubled-down on the partisanship and divisiveness that have characterized his presidency using his address to attack those who disagree with him &amp; take credit for the successes of the prior Admin while misleading on his record. #SOTU2020 https://t.co/TTVlfKdn3V https://t.co/2oYbsj4ubH,2020-02-05 04:25:04,Twitter Web App,33,73

The President said he wanted to “negotiate like crazy” to #LowerDrugCosts. House Dems passed #HR3 to do just that and it sits unattended in the GOP-led Senate.

Despite what the President said in his address he recently claimed that he would look into cutting Social Security and Medicaid for the millions of Americans who rely on it. He even put a timeline on it: later this year. #SOTU2020 https://t.co/b1EFLaI73j,2020-02-05 03:22:37,Twitter Web App,50,81
The President inherited a strong economy. Instead of working to ensure Americans felt its benefits he enacted a #GOPTaxScam a massive giveaway to the wealthy that exploded our deficit and left most Americans behind. #SOTU2020 https://t.co/bdUZc7JAD2,2020-02-05 03:20:40,Twitter Web App,74,118

In order to do “impartial justice” Senators needed to hear testimony from witnesses. It’s shameful that GOP Senators voted against doing so.

POTUS inherited a surging economy from his predecessor but his policies have failed to sustain that pace of growth.

The tragic shooting in Temple Hills should have never occurred.

Happy birthday to my friend @BennieGThompson. The Caucus is grateful for your leadership as Chair of @HomelandDems and your work to keep our nation safe and secure including your bill to protect religious institutions that was signed into law today.,2020-01-29 01:00:54,Twitter for iPhone,3,5

Americans ought to be alarmed by the CBO's new projections. I urge POTUS &amp; the GOP Senate to work with House Dems to build on our bipartisan budget agreement last year &amp; strive for real action to make our budgets more sustainable and deal with the ill effects of the #GOPTaxScam.,2020-01-29 00:27:55,Twitter Web App,4,23
Predictably the GOP is using these deficits to argue for cuts to critical programs including Medicare and Social Security. Just last week POTUS admitted that he will break his promise to voters not to seek cuts to these programs in order to offset the new deficits he created.,2020-01-29 00:27:55,Twitter Web App,9,22
While President Trump and his allies promised that the tax cuts would yield 6% GDP growth and pay for themselves the reality is today is slower economic growth and trillions in new debt left to our children and grandchildren.,2020-01-29 00:27:55,Twitter Web App,3,12
As a result of the #GOPtaxscam in which Republicans gave massive tax cuts to the wealthiest at the expense of everyone else the nonpartisan @USCBO now expects permanent trillion-dollar deficits.,2020-01-29 00:27:55,Twitter Web App,18,34
This is a serious time in America. Today I spoke on the House Floor to implore my Senate colleagues to support a fair and impartial impeachment trial and allow witnesses like Ambassador Bolton to be heard. https://t.co/Q3MbF7wykm,2020-01-29 00:07:26,Twitter Web App,19,91
POTUS sought office on a raft of economic promises which he has failed to deliver on. Today I joined my colleagues in discussing #TrumpsBrokenPromises and how House Democrats are fighting to ensure more working Americans can get ahead in today’s economy. https://t.co/OK70B0Pp91,2020-01-28 23:33:47,Twitter Web App,4,27
As we look ahead to 2020 House Democrats will continue to make economic opportunity our focus. I thank @RepDonBeyer @RepRichardNeal @RepJohnYarmuth and other House Democrats for joining me to discuss #TrumpBrokenPromises today.,2020-01-28 22:04:00,Twitter Web App,3,13
That’s why the Democratic-led House voted last year to #RaiseTheWage ensure #EqualPay give federal employees a pay raise #LowerDrugCosts make it easier to save for a secure retirement and to protect multi-employer pension funds. #ForThePeople,2020-01-28 22:03:17,Twitter Web App,1,12
@JECDems @POTUS According to the December #jobsreport hourly wage growth slipped to its slowest rate in 18 months a far cry from the $4000 annual salary increases President Trump promised would trickle down from his #GOPTaxScam.,2020-01-28 22:03:17,Twitter Web App,4,14
@JECDems @POTUS On wages we see another lost opportunity. For three years President Trump and the GOP-led Senate have refused to support legislation to #RaisetheWage which the House passed under a Democratic majority last year.,2020-01-28 22:02:15,Twitter Web App,4,12
@JECDems @POTUS As a result of this President’s policies the number of Americans without health insurance rose to 8.5% in 2018. That was the first increase in a decade. #TrumpBrokenPromises https://t.co/G7D1fMr5jt,2020-01-28 22:01:02,Twitter Web App,19,19
@JECDems What @POTUS doesn’t seem to understand is that a thriving economy is more than a growing stock market. It’s about working people and their families. It’s about whether America is still a place where everyone has a fair shot has access to opportunities and can get ahead.,2020-01-28 22:00:27,Twitter Web App,4,12
We have also seen this President campaign on reducing America’s trade deficit but it has increased on his watch. In fact according to the @JECDems’ report as many as 450000 jobs were lost in 2019 as a result of this President’s trade wars. https://t.co/8hBo65sy4n,2020-01-28 21:58:32,Twitter Web App,35,66
Instead of reversing deficits &amp; eliminating the debt as promised President Trump has overseen an increase – with deficits topping $1 TRILLION each year for the next decade – fueled by his #GOPTaxScam that gave $2 trillion in unpaid-for tax cuts to the wealthiest in our country. https://t.co/mSt4caYlLd,2020-01-28 21:53:55,Twitter Web App,31,44
While President Trump boasted that his Administration would see 6% GDP growth it’s not even close to that. It’s clear that the #GOPTaxScam did little to boost GDP as he claimed it would. https://t.co/KRSrBuUmWg https://t.co/p22X3xzJ1f,2020-01-28 21:51:38,Twitter Web App,13,40
Under President Obama our unemployment rate declined 5.3 percentage points. Under President Trump our unemployment rate declined 1.2 percentage points. President Trump inherited a downward trend in unemployment and he has failed to keep up the pace. https://t.co/saDJfAbMQ0 https://t.co/cApCmTzBFu,2020-01-28 21:49:30,Twitter Web App,73,163
Over the last 35 months of President Obama’s 2nd term – the same number of months Trump has been in office – our economy gained an average of 227k jobs per month. Under President Trump so far that figure is 191k. That’s 36000 fewer jobs created per month. https://t.co/OGHOnsfLEa https://t.co/UYBoxD7dnp,2020-01-28 21:47:11,Twitter Web App,43,58
President Trump sought office on a raft of economic promises. He promised to create 25 million new jobs in 10 years. He promised 6% growth in GDP. He promised to eliminate the debt “get wages up” and make health care “much less expensive” and "much better.",2020-01-28 21:46:51,Twitter Web App,11,35
While I speak on the House Floor about the economy my staff will be live tweeting. Follow along with #TrumpBrokenPromises. https://t.co/ZmrhsfodRc,2020-01-28 21:45:05,Twitter Web App,7,20
.@POTUS likes to take credit for the good news in the economy so I am joining my colleagues on the Floor to discuss how the current economic expansion began well before he took office &amp; how he is preventing its benefits from being felt by all Americans. https://t.co/PE4EUDWXq4,2020-01-28 21:44:29,Twitter Web App,20,66
SOON: I’ll be on the House Floor to discuss a new @JECDems report that shows: ❌POTUS inherited a strong economy he did not create it.   ❌The #GOPTaxScam did not yield the benefits promised. ❌Trump’s trade war has cost jobs. #TrumpBrokenPromises https://t.co/sS9xgpUKFT,2020-01-28 20:37:54,Twitter Web App,8,36
34 years ago today the tragic Challenger explosion took the lives of 7 Americans including my friend Christa McAuliffe.

I also told press that we will consider the Financial Services Credit Reporting Reform Act this week. Next week we will vote on the PRO Act to ensure workers have the right to organize and a Puerto Rico supplemental bill to assist with the earthquake recovery efforts.,2020-01-28 17:49:26,Twitter Web App,4,13
I also discussed with reporters that the House will consider Rep. Lee and Khanna’s bills to reassert Congress’ constitutional authority on war. We expect these measures to pass and the Senate ought to take them up and join us in reasserting Congress’s role.,2020-01-28 17:49:25,Twitter Web App,7,16
Today at my weekly press conference I told press that if the Senate offers anything less than a full fair trial they are covering up the President’s abuse of office. I call on them to have Bolton and other witnesses testify – consistent with the demands of most Americans.,2020-01-28 17:49:25,Twitter Web App,21,65
The Trump Administration wants to rollback the progress we’ve made. I will continue to fight these efforts and ensure states like Maryland can lead the way in setting standards that protect Americans from dirty air and the threats of climate change.,2020-01-28 03:12:21,Twitter for iPhone,9,35
The threat of the climate crisis cannot be ignored. Cars and trucks are now the leading source of carbon pollution in the U.S. and it’s critical automakers and policy makers work together to dramatically improve the fuel economy of these vehicles. https://t.co/Mt18lZJIuB,2020-01-28 03:12:21,Twitter for iPhone,9,44
It is time for Republican senators to stop hiding from the truth. With Bolton’s forthcoming accounts that undercut a key White House defense they must choose to honor our Constitution or cover up the President’s misconduct. They must call Bolton to testify. https://t.co/spW1LIPXEH,2020-01-28 01:38:08,Twitter Web App,39,125
75 years after the liberation of Auschwitz and other Nazi death camps too many Americans do not know basic information about the Holocaust.

As we observe International #HolocaustRemembrance Day I'm proud the House passed @RepMaloney’s bill to strengthen and expand Holocaust education efforts.

New reports that Amb. Bolton heard directly from POTUS that he wanted to improperly withhold military aid to get Ukraine to interfere in our elections underscore why Senators must call Bolton to testify.

Senators swore an oath to do “impartial justice” in the impeachment trial.

Any fair trial would allow witnesses to be heard which is why 72% of Americans agree that the Senate impeachment trial should allow witnesses to testify including 69% of Republicans. The Senate ought to do so &amp; honor their oath to “do impartial justice.” https://t.co/IbwCn1T2ma,2020-01-23 23:21:55,Twitter for iPhone,38,73
When is the “right time” to break a campaign pledge? The American people deserve to know now. Not only would this represent yet another broken promise but it is yet another example of how @POTUS puts the wealthiest Americans ahead of working families and seniors.,2020-01-23 20:46:22,Twitter Web App,5,20
For anyone who doubted that the GOP wouldn’t go after Medicare and Social Security after exploding the deficit with the #GOPTaxScam here’s the latest evidence: @POTUS said he’ll look at cutting Medicare or Social Security “at the right time.” https://t.co/uwRFhUhbPA https://t.co/bSeiRbcEUU,2020-01-23 20:46:22,Twitter Web App,24,43
Tax cuts have never paid for themselves but that’s not stopping the GOP from peddling that falsehood. 2 years after the #GOPTaxScam was enacted the deficit has swelled to $1 trillion &amp; the law is benefiting the wealthy at the expense of the middle class. https://t.co/5GC5u0on9A,2020-01-23 20:43:20,Twitter Web App,7,33
Instead of protecting Americans' drinking water the Admin has again reversed a key environmental safeguard.

One of the first major bills passed by the Dem-led House Majority was #HR1 the #ForThePeople Act. It would address the #CitizensUnited decision and end the era of dark money in politics.
