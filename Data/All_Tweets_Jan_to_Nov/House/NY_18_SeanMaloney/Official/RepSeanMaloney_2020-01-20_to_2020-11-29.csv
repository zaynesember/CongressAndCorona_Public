NY is looking at a $14 billion deficit this year and $60 billion through 2024.  The federal government needs to get their heads out of the sand &amp; send help.

.@stevenmnuchin1 &amp; the Trump Admin may be allergic to facts but to be clear: $600 a week doesn’t keep people out of the workforce. COVID-19 keeps people out.  Workers need the extra $600 extended. They need the Heroes Act.  That's how we're going to recover from this.,2020-08-04 21:57:12,Twitter Web App,46,264

Here’s a full summary of the President’s failings to date on the Coronavirus. And some good analysis. Sadly we’re all paying the price... https://t.co/lsuYQtohzb,2020-03-13 16:51:11,Twitter for iPhone,767,2054
7. National ban on large events 8. SBA — Expedite small business loans 9. IRS - Delay filing deadlines; advance earned income tax credits  10. Labor - Nat’l plan for telecommuting and staggered shifts 11. CDC - Mandatory test results reporting &amp; restrict access to nursing homes.,2020-03-13 16:29:30,Twitter for iPhone,23,118
3. FEMA - deploy 1000 mobile trailers w/ instant free testing 4. HHS - Order hospitals to postpone elective surgeries 5. Convert unused hospital wards and urgent care centers to outfitted respiratory wards 6. Surge production of re-agents and ventilators (only 12k in stock),2020-03-13 16:24:17,Twitter for iPhone,44,145
Here what the President should be doing: 1. CDC - Surge testing capacity &amp; processing. We’ve now shipped 2m tests which only covers about 900k people (because need 2-3/person). Processing capacity is only 16k/day must increase that.  2. FDA - Repo therapies &amp; vaccine,2020-03-13 16:21:00,Twitter for iPhone,47,156
Building off $8B from last week House action 2day will provide: (1) Free corona testing for everyone who needs it; (2) Paid emergency leave; (3) Enhanced Unemployment Insurance; (4) strengthened food security initiatives; &amp; (5) Increased federal funds to help states w/ Medicaid.,2020-03-13 16:17:23,Twitter for iPhone,77,270
We need a plan now to: (1) close K-12 schools for 4 weeks (2) re-purpose some w/ their gymnasiums as contingency respiratory treatment centers; (3) re-open separate entrances as grab-and-go nutrition and child service centers; &amp; (4) co-locate rapid no-wait testing there.,2020-03-13 15:24:20,Twitter for iPhone,212,883
We need more testing. We need a better understanding of #COVID-19.

Trump isn't going to pull the wool over our eyes - we all know the GOP has fought to destroy the ACA &amp; its pre-existing condition protections for a decade.

Lt. Col. Vindman told his dad he did the right thing to leave the Soviet Union. He told his dad he’d be fine for telling the truth.
