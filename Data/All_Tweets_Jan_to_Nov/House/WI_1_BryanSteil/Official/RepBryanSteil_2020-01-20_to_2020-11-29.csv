Currently if 529 account withdrawals are not used for qualified education expenses or tuition for elementary or secondary schools they are subject to state and federal income taxes and an additional 10% federal tax penalty on earnings of the account. 6/9,2020-04-27 20:01:05,Twitter for iPhone,0,0
529 plans were recently expanded to cover high school &amp; elementary school tuition.

What are 529 plans? A 529 plan is a tax-advantaged savings plan designed to encourage saving for future education costs. It is like a retirement account for qualified education expenses. Typically these plans have been used for higher education costs like college tuition. 4/9,2020-04-27 20:01:04,Twitter for iPhone,0,0
Parents &amp; schools are facing unique challenges while trying to educate our children from home. These can range from lack of economic resources to lack of tools necessary for distance education.
