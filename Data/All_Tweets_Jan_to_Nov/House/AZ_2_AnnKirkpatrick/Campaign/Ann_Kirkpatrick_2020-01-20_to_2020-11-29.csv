Glad to see @dougducey reopening the healthcare market for those who are uninsured. But now it’s time for Republicans to drop the ACA lawsuit which threatens coverage for those Americans and the 2.8 million with pre-existing conditions.  #ProtectOurCare,2020-03-26 16:25:17,Twitter for iPhone,6,24
Last November Americans made their voices heard by electing leaders who promised to support &amp; expand the #ACA.  That's why on the 10th anniversary I have a renewed commitment to fight for accessible health care for all. #ACAanniversary,2020-03-25 00:00:44,Hootsuite Inc.,2,4
Because of the #ACA 17 million Americans gained health coverage. I am so proud of the work we did in Congress to make that happen. As we approach November Democrats will continue working hard to uphold their #ACA Commitments. #CantStopWontStop  #ProtectOurCare #ACAanniversary,2020-03-24 21:00:35,Hootsuite Inc.,2,9

The pandemic is exposing our woefully inadequate healthcare system each day that goes by. We should be working to expand our healthcare system and to make it more accessible not less. https://t.co/m87nAWDXJ2,2020-03-21 00:01:17,Twitter for iPhone,4,4

About 28 million Americans are still uninsured despite expansions made under the #ACA. Our inaccessible healthcare system makes it harder to navigate public healthcare crises. It’s time for action. #StateofHealthCare,2020-03-05 19:48:13,Twitter Web App,1,9
