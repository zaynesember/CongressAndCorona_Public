We’ve gotten 6 pieces of legislation signed into law helped thousands of Staten Islanders and South Brooklynites and brought home nearly $200 million to #NY11 but we’ve got a hell of a lot left to do.

The VA is committed to innovative ways to ramp up #COVID testing but right now they're struggling to operate at more than about 50% testing capacity because they don't have enough swabs.

The bipartisan Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act: - extends the rehiring deadline - increases the limit on nonpayroll expenses like rent and utilities from 25 to 40 percent - extends the program from June 30 to December 31 - extends loan terms from 2 to 5 years,2020-06-05 19:45:37,Twitter for iPhone,1,9
The Paycheck Protection Program was designed to give businesses relief not strap them with debt they can't pay off. Unfortunately the restrictions @SBAgov put in place didn't meet that goal so Congress fixed it &amp; today the President signed it into law. https://t.co/6vA7Esmxff,2020-06-05 19:45:37,Twitter for iPhone,4,9

RUMC SIUH and several hospitals in Brooklyn will lose tens of millions of dollars in funding. There is no doubt that this will have a devastating impact on our healthcare unless the administration reverses this decision.,2020-02-28 22:32:59,Twitter for iPhone,4,7
.@SI_PPS has literally lead the charge in showing the rest of the country how to fight the opioid epidemic in a comprehensive and effective way.   Now these cuts mean the SI PPS program will likely cease to exist by 2021.,2020-02-28 22:32:58,Twitter for iPhone,4,10
We don’t yet know what kind of strain the #coronavirus is going to put on our healthcare system and now is not the time to be compounding that problem by putting financial strain and uncertainty on the healthcare providers who are on the frontlines keeping us safe.,2020-02-28 22:32:58,Twitter for iPhone,4,3
Without warning this Administration made the drastic decision this week to rip $625m from NY medical providers - $ that had already been allocated and budgeted for. Today I joined @StatenIslandDA and our local hospitals to talk about the devastating impacts this will have: https://t.co/Opmij57yyC,2020-02-28 22:32:58,Twitter for iPhone,15,26
On Monday night my office will be working with @COJO_SI &amp; @JCRCNY to host another Security Grant Workshop.  We'll keep doing everything in our power to ensure no one has to live in fear and our schools and houses of worship have the resources needed to protect themselves. https://t.co/KTLZbw92Un,2020-02-28 20:54:45,TweetDeck,5,7
Thank you Jeannette &amp; John Salvo for coming to see me in DC. I'm proud to support legislation to help our friends and family living with hemophilia and other bleeding disorders. https://t.co/roVKJ0MBfO,2020-02-28 19:45:53,Twitter for iPhone,0,10
Dr. Mohammad Khalid says he considers it moral and ethical duty" to help others and he shows that every single day not just in his professional life but through his passion for community service.  Proud to recognize that service yesterday on the House Floor. https://t.co/ZugHwqyprl,2020-02-28 16:37:59,TweetDeck,5,31
This all could have--and should have--been avoided from the beginning. Thank you Governor Cuomo for putting a fair compromise out there. I will continue to fight so this is fixed and New Yorkers are no longer collateral damage in political food fights. https://t.co/K7MPpjaCnr,2020-02-27 22:07:47,Twitter for iPhone,3,14
Let’s be clear about what will happen if these cuts are not restored: someone on the cusp of recovery from opioid addiction will lose access to the help they need and health care access could be restricted as we deal with a potential pandemic. We can't let this happen.,2020-02-27 00:14:29,Twitter for iPhone,6,12
I just sent a letter demanding the Administration stop playing politics with our healthcare before it has devastating impacts: @SI_PPS which has been doing some of the most innovative work in the country to combat the opioid epidemic—will likely cease to exist by 2021. https://t.co/CRh8ncYjBv,2020-02-27 00:14:28,Twitter for iPhone,5,12
I am sick and tired of this Administration punishing my constituents because of political vendettas. These cuts could be catastrophic not only to the health care of Staten Islanders and South Brooklynites but our efforts to combat the opioid epidemic. https://t.co/nAxEYjJTUx,2020-02-27 00:14:26,Twitter for iPhone,15,33
It never should have taken this long but after more than a century of failed attempts today Congress finally declared the vile act of lynching a hate crime. I was proud to vote to #OutlawLynching and bring justice to more than 4000 known victims. https://t.co/mNJWjW8I1B,2020-02-26 23:31:49,TweetDeck,7,33
Can't believe that in the year 2020 296 of 316 NYCHA developments don't have fire sprinklers. @RepPeteKing and I introduced the Public Housing Fire Safety Act to install sprinklers in public housing and stop putting residents and first responders at risk. https://t.co/w7WO3BLYGB,2020-02-26 22:43:42,TweetDeck,2,7
HAPPENING NOW: I'm chairing my second @HomelandDems hearing on the rise in anti-Semitic domestic terrorism with officials from @DHSgov and @FBI. I will not lose sight or focus on this issue which has hit far too close to home. https://t.co/QT71acoOnX,2020-02-26 20:21:49,TweetDeck,6,6
These are complicated challenges and every second we aren’t researching a solution is a second we can never get back – and our city will pay the price whether through more severe flooding higher insurance premiums and even lives. This study must be reinstated.,2020-02-25 22:36:12,Twitter for iPhone,3,11
Despite what the President thinks superstorms cannot be wished away by denying the existence of climate change.,2020-02-25 22:36:12,Twitter for iPhone,5,24
I want to be very clear that this does not impact the construction of the East Shore Seawall. However the administration’s decision to cancel this study is no different than telling New York City to go ahead and drown. https://t.co/uTNAzZbqPO,2020-02-25 22:36:12,Twitter for iPhone,18,36
The @Tunnel2Towers Foundation refuses to let the passage of time get in the way of supporting our 9/11 heroes and first responders.  Thank you to Staten Island's @UPS facility for presenting them with $15000 this morning to continue their inspiring work. https://t.co/sReb6u8ub0,2020-02-21 22:27:09,TweetDeck,5,20

The offshore wind project at the Arthur Kill Terminal is an incredible opportunity to provide more reliable energy for New Yorkers bring over $400 million in economic growth and best of all to do it on the back of good-paying union jobs.  Proud to support this project. https://t.co/uvHEsTAbrV,2020-02-20 16:30:46,TweetDeck,8,34
Great seeing you this morning. You're absolutely right we have so much work to do to improve commutes and transit accessibility. I've been doing #MaxAtYourCorner and #MaxAtYourDoor since Day 1 because hearing from constituents just like you helps me take on these tough fights. https://t.co/LTrfw669zA,2020-02-19 22:22:11,Twitter for iPhone,7,44
Last night I stopped by Community Board 2's meeting to give some updates on the Seawall our efforts to keep fentanyl off our streets the fight against domestic terrorism and so much more that we've accomplished in year one.

BREAKING: @HomelandDems unanimously passed my bill directing @DHSgov to develop a terrorist threat assessment of foreign white supremacist groups. This kind of violence puts us all at risk at home &amp; abroad and we need a full understanding of this threat. https://t.co/pRMlC5OMig,2020-02-12 22:54:11,TweetDeck,46,142
Terrorism is terrorism.  White supremacists today are organizing in a similar fashion to jihadist terrorist organizations like Al Qaeda in the 1980s and 90s &amp; it's time to give law enforcement the same tools they need to confront it. https://t.co/MqmAPzNsrV,2020-02-12 18:46:47,TweetDeck,29,104
Vietnam and Korean War vets of color fought for our freedom abroad but struggled to find the same freedoms here at home.  Appreciated the opportunity at @VetAffairsDems to highlight the work @AmericanLegion and @CNASdc are doing to right this historic wrong. https://t.co/1hWurpIyEH,2020-02-12 00:32:24,Twitter Media Studio,8,29
The Brooklyn VA is the bedrock of vets’ health care in NYC so it should be easy for all vets to access. But I've been shocked to  hear story after story from constituents about the lack of parking.  That's unacceptable so I'm asking @DeptVetAffairs to fund a new parking deck. https://t.co/kS5thkdCsn,2020-02-11 22:05:45,TweetDeck,6,10
Building on our $9m for increased safety and accessibility this is another win-win for all Brooklyn commuters.  Carrying more passengers with less traffic = better service on one of South Brooklyn's busiest lines and fewer vehicles clogging our streets. https://t.co/Azj6MfBVfj,2020-02-11 16:55:39,TweetDeck,5,10
Beyond celebrating the legacy of heroes like Dr. King and Rosa Parks #BlackHistoryMonth is a time to highlight remarkable local leaders like Ms. Margie Garvin who is on the ground fighting every single day to improve people's lives.  Proud to honor her on the House Floor today. https://t.co/LtjLkQTYLY,2020-02-10 23:12:08,TweetDeck,8,44
Unions are the backbone of our economy but for too long Congress has sat on the sidelines and watched as they were trampled in the name of corporate profit.  It’s time they get their rightful share in the prosperity they created. https://t.co/kIMVdS8r96,2020-02-07 23:02:17,Twitter for iPhone,5,14
Last night we passed the #PROAct to:  ✅ Penalize companies and executives that violate workers' rights  ✅ Expand collective bargaining rights ✅ Close loopholes that corporations use to exploit workers ✅ Strengthen workers' access to fair union elections https://t.co/4Xr0SjMYN7,2020-02-07 23:01:05,Twitter for iPhone,6,25

I couldn't help but feel inspired when I first heard the story of Mark and David Carles' unbreakable bond.  It was my honor to tell their story on the House floor today and to let Mark know that we're all in his corner as he fights cancer. https://t.co/DcXB5f3b4A,2020-02-05 20:45:00,TweetDeck,2,13

My hope is that Rob can serve as a reminder to all of us that when we put partisanship aside and focus on doing the right thing Congress can still work the way it’s supposed to and tackle the issues that matter.,2020-01-31 18:45:38,Twitter for iPhone,0,7
.@SerraRob didn't just selflessly serve our city after 9/11 he continued to fight to #Renew911VCF and ensure that we always kept our promises to our first-responders and their families.

As a teenager Rabbi Cohn joined the partisan forces fighting Nazi tyranny and among other feats helped 56 Jewish families escape the horrors of the Holocaust.

There’s no silver bullet to end our commuting nightmare but the West Shore Rapid Transit project is too important to that effort to tolerate any delays in bringing it to fruition.,2020-01-28 23:18:37,Twitter for iPhone,1,4
Proud to see such broad bipartisan support from @HeyNowJO @dianesavino @senatorlanza @JoeBorelliNYC @StevenMatteo and @CMDebiRose joining me in urging the MTA to quickly fund the necessary environmental impact study on a West Shore Rapid Transit. https://t.co/AB3neeQVIt,2020-01-28 23:18:36,Twitter for iPhone,7,17

BREAKING: @sewfalcons and I.S. 75 will get $2.2m in @FEMA funding for backup emergency generators. The next Superstorm is a matter of when not if.

Three years of the Muslim Ban have caused more than enough harm and devastation for families in my district and across the country while doing nothing to improve our national security. It's time to repeal it.,2020-01-27 22:23:10,Twitter for iPhone,2,10

It's a mission that cannot be accomplished simply by tweeting #NeverAgain but by taking this opportunity to really reflect on the lessons from that horrific period and how they can guide our actions every single day to ensure such persecution never happens again.,2020-01-27 20:46:50,Twitter for iPhone,4,13
The liberation of Auschwitz 75 years ago brought to a close the most heinous chapter of the 20th century but it did not extinguish the evil ideology that led us to that dark moment in history. That remains our mission for the 21st century. #HolocaustMemorialDay,2020-01-27 20:46:49,Twitter for iPhone,7,39
The VA should work for our veterans not the other way around but I've heard too many stories of vets who must travel hours out of state to get the C&amp;P exams they need to determine their benefits.  That’s why I called on the VA to expand telehealth &amp; meet vets where they are. https://t.co/vPYrKmia0r,2020-01-24 23:09:06,Twitter for iPhone,8,15
We're going to continue pushing for more fast ferry routes especially to help Brooklyn commuters but this an important chance to turn the page on Staten Island being left out of the fast ferry program and will offer more desperately needed commuting options.,2020-01-24 20:30:52,Twitter for iPhone,1,7
