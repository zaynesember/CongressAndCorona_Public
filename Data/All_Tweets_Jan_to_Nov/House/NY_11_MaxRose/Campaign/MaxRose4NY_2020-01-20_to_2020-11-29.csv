Our world is changing and so are the ways in which white supremacist groups inflict acts of extremism and terrorism. That's why I introduced this legislation to ensure our law enforcement is able to properly assess security threats and keep us safe. https://t.co/vhmhApinmT,2020-02-04 19:19:28,Twitter Web App,16,72

In the @NYDailyNews I argue that the time has come for an administration that will do more than just talk but will put New York City front and center in its national effort to rebuild our infrastructure.  @MikeBloomberg will #getitdone https://t.co/0DOg7nCSdX,2020-02-03 14:41:46,Twitter for iPhone,12,49

This behavior isn’t brave it’s dangerous and idiotic. Our police officers civil servants and commuters shouldn’t have to deal with this asinine behavior. I hope those responsible are arrested and held accountable.  https://t.co/417T5XM7NQ,2020-01-31 21:41:34,Twitter for iPhone,32,141
