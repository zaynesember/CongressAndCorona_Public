No wonder Democrats prevented President @realDonaldTrump's team from participating in the vast majority of their sham impeachment.  The President's defense team just destroyed the Democrats' 3-day case in only 2 hours.,2020-01-25 17:25:57,Twitter Web App,7171,24625

Democrats are so hypocritical. Why didn't they ask for witnesses in the House? Why didn't they go to the Supreme Court which is the correct process?

Opening arguments have begun.   Impeachment has never actually been about Ukraine Russia bribery or anything else.

Democrats rushed to impeach President @realDonaldTrump ignoring due process along the way.   Then they sat on the articles of impeachment for an entire month.
