Watching #ShamImpeachment .    #Democrats are such hypocrites. On one hand they say they have strong evidence in the next breath they cry that they need more witnesses. It's not #Republicans fault that House #Democrats did a poor unfair job.,2020-01-21 19:44:58,Twitter for Android,35,118

In an impeachment trial the Senate’s role is to evaluate the facts and evidence that the House has already gathered – not redo the entire investigation.  It is not the Senate’s job to gather more witnesses and documents because House Democrats failed to make their case.,2020-01-21 18:58:28,Twitter Web App,139,378
Opening statement by #ChuckSchumer is total BS. House Democrats wouldn't give President @realDonaldTrump any due process in House. If #Democrats wanted witnesses they should have called them in the House instead of rushing thru #impeachment by Christmas.,2020-01-21 18:06:58,Twitter for Android,211,544
