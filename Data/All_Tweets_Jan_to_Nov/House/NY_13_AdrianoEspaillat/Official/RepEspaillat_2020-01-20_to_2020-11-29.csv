America is a nation of immigrants. They have built our cities invigorated our communities and enriched our country. Becoming a citizen cements that legacy by granting new Americans the same rights as every American. #Citizenship4All,2020-09-17 17:41:15,Twitter Web App,4,12
Every time an immigrant becomes an American citizen our union grows stronger. We are united by shared values not shared race creed or national origin.

In the middle of a pandemic &amp; economic crisis the Trump admin raised the application fee to become a U.S. citizen from $640 to $1160. In 1995 it was $225.   Make no mistake.

It’s been just over a month since the House passed the George Floyd #JusticeInPolicing Act and Senate Republicans refuse to take action. RT if you agree that’s unacceptable. https://t.co/pKmKK6KohP,2020-08-11 21:53:44,Twitter for iPhone,18,23
Republicans need to take the harm of the pandemic seriously. That means less dismissive tweets and more solutions for American families desperate for help. Trump’s #FailureToLead has done enough to hurt the American people https://t.co/S42hIRPYAW,2020-08-11 20:26:46,Twitter for iPhone,4,4
Having a reliable efficient and fully-funded @USPS has never been more important.   By undermining the post office Trump is attacking the ballot box and threatening the delivery of medicine &amp; other vital packages. #SaveTheUSPS,2020-08-11 19:23:28,Twitter Web App,6,7
Families across the country rely on the postal service – to vote to receive their medication and to run their businesses. Donald Trump’s political attack on @USPS is an attack on our democracy and our economy. Congress must #SaveTheUSPS  https://t.co/6GbveGjl1i,2020-08-11 19:22:49,Twitter Web App,3,4

It's deeply troubling that @HillandaleFarm gained $4 million in illegal revenue from nearly quadrupled priced eggs during #COVID19. Taking advantage of New York families during a public health crisis is shameful disgraceful &amp; should never be tolerated.  https://t.co/B7udBTCsMf,2020-08-11 18:21:21,Twitter Web App,2,3
Instead the executive order merely directs federal agencies to “review all existing authorities and resources” and “make a determination” about whether halting evictions would prevent the spread of coronavirus. It does not specify what actions agencies can take to halt them.,2020-08-11 17:50:59,Twitter Web App,0,1
Trump failed even to use his existing authority to reinstate the limited federal eviction moratorium that expired on July 24 which covered 30% of renters nationwide. #FailuretoLead,2020-08-11 17:50:59,Twitter Web App,0,1

Women make up 52% of essential workers during the #COVID19 pandemic.  And Women of Color - including Latinas - are the most likely to work in low-wage jobs where they are being shortchanged by a combined gender and racial wage gap.  We need #HealthEquity for Women of Color. https://t.co/qloyaQpGkO,2020-08-11 17:27:46,Twitter for iPhone,7,9
The coronavirus pandemic has disproportionately impacted the health and wellbeing of Latinas. For Latinas the #COVID19 pandemic hits hard whether they go to work or stay at home.   Latinas have always been essential - and deserve #HealthEquity.  https://t.co/B9HaA5FIAH,2020-08-11 17:26:55,Twitter for iPhone,15,11

Trump’s weak executive actions: -Fail to help many unemployed Americans -Threaten seniors’ #SocialSecurity and #Medicare -Continue the President’s #FailureToLead by ignoring education testing health care elections and the Postal service   https://t.co/yS1a9KtJcx,2020-08-10 20:48:58,Twitter for iPhone,6,6

It's been 12 weeks since @HouseDemocrats passed the #HeroesAct in response to the #COVID19 pandemic &amp; as Americans continue to lose their jobs homes &amp; cases rise today’s Trump actions further demonstrate his #FailureToLead and his inability to understand the needs of families,2020-08-09 01:46:39,Twitter for iPhone,27,38
When asked by a reporter why $400 instead of the previous $600 Trump responded "This is the money they need this is the money they want this gives them a great incentive to go back to work.”   It’s clear that Donald Trump truly doesn’t understand what’s fully at stake here.,2020-08-09 01:30:52,Twitter for iPhone,2,7
Today’s executive actions signed by Donald Trump do NOT go far enough to give American families the relief they need and deserve.   Trump will push families further in debt put more lives at risk and drive more workers into unemployment.   https://t.co/iV7XyEKVqg,2020-08-09 01:30:51,Twitter for iPhone,4,4
