Michael Flynn lied to investigators about communicating with a foreign adversary. That's a crime.   Trump dangled a pardon in exchange for Flynn's non-cooperation. That's abuse of power.

Filling the SCOTUS vacancy during a lame duck session after the American people have voted for new leadership is undemocratic and a clear violation of the public trust in elected officials. Congress would have to act and expanding the court would be the right place to start.,2020-09-19 18:04:53,Twitter for iPhone,1953,9643
If Sen. McConnell and @SenateGOP were to force through a nominee during the lame duck session—before a new Senate and President can take office—then the incoming Senate should immediately move to expand the Supreme Court. 1/2 https://t.co/BDYQ0KVmJe,2020-09-19 18:00:59,Twitter for iPhone,6171,24472

Pregnant workers should have the right to the basic accommodations they need to safely do their jobs. A longer break a glass of water a place to sit. The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act—which I first intro'd in 2012—makes those rights law.

"Mr. Barr’s practice of using DOJ to shield the President and his allies goes to the beginning of his tenure at DOJ. Last year when the Special Counsel had completed his investigation...the AG blatantly mischaracterized the Special Counsel’s findings on the President’s behalf." https://t.co/C1W0bRDwM4,2020-06-24 20:09:00,Twitter Media Studio,360,854
"Make no mistake: this was not an isolated incident...Barr’s actions make clear that in his DOJ the President’s allies get special treatment the President’s enemies—real and imagined—are targeted for extra scrutiny and the needs of the American people are generally ignored." https://t.co/nwGEOYQMQJ,2020-06-24 19:58:36,Twitter Media Studio,1226,3116
There is injustice at the Department of Justice. AG Barr has abandoned the DOJ's traditionally nonpartisan role prioritizing the President's interests over the American people's.

President Trump's latest executive order suspending immigration is both an abuse of his executive power and a politically motivated attempt to shift blame.

I'm glad President Trump's response to calls for police reform isn't limited to tear-gassing protesters. Unfortunately his EO is severely lacking.

The Trump Administration has yet to close @NatlParkService sites. Places like @StatueEllisNPS are still allowing people to crowd boats and security lines for tourism. We need to close these non-essential locations immediately as we all take necessary precautions.,2020-03-15 19:06:44,Twitter for iPhone,212,738

The American people should be able to trust that their government will work to keep them safe from a public health crisis like coronavirus. Today the House honored that trust.,2020-03-04 22:21:36,Twitter Web App,16,82
I will continue to monitor the situation in New York and around the country and will work with my colleagues to ensure the full coordinated force of the federal government is behind our efforts to stop the spread of this disease.,2020-03-04 22:21:36,Twitter Web App,14,64

It supports the community health centers that have been on the frontline of the fight against coronavirus and reimburses the state and local governments that have already borne so much of the cost of our response.,2020-03-04 22:21:35,Twitter Web App,12,48
However today’s vote is a necessary first step. The spending package will allocate hundreds of millions of dollars to areas that have already been hit by the virus including New York.,2020-03-04 22:21:35,Twitter Web App,11,54
It will provide much-needed resources for local state and federal governments to adequately prepare for and react to coronavirus. More funding may be necessary in the future and I stand prepared to support any additional resources we may need.,2020-03-04 22:21:35,Twitter Web App,11,56
I was therefore proud to join my colleagues in the House in passing an emergency spending package that will provide federal and state authorities with the funds they need to combat the pandemic. This funding package significantly exceeds the figure requested by the Trump Admin.,2020-03-04 22:21:35,Twitter Web App,16,79

If this law stands there would only be one clinic in all of Louisiana. So much is on the line but it's really quite simple: the Supreme Court must follow precedent and strike down the law.   For everyone abortion must be #MyRightMyDecision,2020-03-04 15:26:43,Twitter Web App,110,318
This case is not an isolated attack. It's another effort by national anti-abortion groups to chip away at abortion rights and exert control over women and their bodies. As the Supreme Court already found in 2016 these laws don't make abortion safer they just shut down clinics.,2020-03-04 15:26:42,Twitter Web App,69,231
Today the Supreme Court considers Louisiana's admitting privileges law a nearly identical law to the one SCOTUS struck down as unconstitutional in 2016. If this law is upheld Roe v.

Congress stands with survivors of sexual misconduct in the courts and everywhere. We will do our job to ensure the courts do not put themselves above the laws that protect nearly every other workplace from harassment and misconduct.,2020-02-13 22:51:23,Twitter Web App,56,357
The power dynamics inherent to the judicial branch make sexual harassment especially difficult to report and protections difficult to enforce. The courts are where justice is delivered—if we can't protect against misconduct from within how can anyone expect justice? https://t.co/ivZAWTGcOW,2020-02-13 22:51:23,Twitter Web App,56,283
