Democrats led by @SpeakerPelosi &amp; @SenSchumer are blocking emergency relief during this public health and economic crisis.  They are holding up life-saving aid with demands that the Green New Deal be added to the bill.   This is abhorrent and indefensible.,2020-03-23 18:38:36,Twitter for iPad,1164,2432

History will judge @SpeakerPelosi for abusing the House’s impeachment power turning a reluctantly used constitutional remedy into a weapon of pure partisan anger.
