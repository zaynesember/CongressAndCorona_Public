President Trump just signed USMCA into law!   This new agreement is a major victory for the people of Wyoming. It will create jobs and open new markets for our farmers ranchers and small businesses. https://t.co/RlSufqM2W9,2020-01-29 17:02:50,Twitter Web App,130,778

By allowing Huawei into U.K. 5G network @BorisJohnson has chosen the surveillance state over the special relationship.  Tragic to see our closest ally a nation Ronald Reagan once called “incandescent with courage” turn away from our alliance and the cause of freedom. @UKinUSA,2020-01-28 13:07:54,Twitter for iPhone,750,970
As we commemorate Holocaust Remembrance Day which comes 75 years after the liberation of Auschwitz we honor the millions of Jews brutally murdered by the Nazis while rededicating ourselves to opposing anti-Semitism in all its forms so that this never happens again. #WeRemember https://t.co/DuySR1uGhj,2020-01-27 18:15:51,Twitter for iPhone,36,176
This morning the White House legal team began taking apart the House Democrats’ impeachment case methodically and completely.   And they reminded the American people once again that when @RepAdamSchiff is talking he’s lying.,2020-01-25 17:50:41,Twitter for iPhone,7404,23263
If you are tired of the Democrats' #ImpeachmentSham just remember they have already admitted that they are planning to impeach the President AGAIN: https://t.co/ckToBz68bZ,2020-01-23 21:30:00,TweetDeck,536,1069
The @EPA’s repeal and replacement of President Obama’s failed WOTUS rule will provide regulatory certainty that respects the water rights of Wyoming’s ranchers and farmers. See my statement here: https://t.co/Mo1zhjffOU,2020-01-23 20:42:32,Twitter Web App,56,140
The disastrous Iran deal negotiated by the Obama Admin. was designed to allow them to cheat. The U.S. should once-and-for-all end all civil-nuclear waivers which Iran has long exploited.

Huawei is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party and its efforts to infiltrate 5G are nefarious at their core. Allowing the company into the U.K.’s 5G networks would pose a national security threat that could not be mitigated or contained. https://t.co/bS4AhL9aaa,2020-01-21 15:52:57,Twitter Web App,715,844
