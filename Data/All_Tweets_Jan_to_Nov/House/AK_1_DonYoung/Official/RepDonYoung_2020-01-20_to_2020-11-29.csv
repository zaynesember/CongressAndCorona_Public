Morgan Stanley Wells Fargo Chase Citigroup and Goldman Sachs announced they would not be financing any drilling.

Puerto Rico has been treated very unfairly due to its current status which is a contributing factor to its ongoing debt crisis. D.C. is doing well financially which is precisely why the need for Puerto Rican statehood is far more urgent.,2020-06-26 19:09:09,Twitter Web App,46,77
The framers intended for territories to be eligible for statehood and I have long advocated for Puerto Rican statehood. I authored the only Puerto Rico statehood bill ever to pass the House and I am very proud of that.,2020-06-26 19:09:09,Twitter Web App,25,58
My Democrat colleagues have dedicated a lot of time to antagonizing President Trump; it is ironic then that their flawed statehood bill would give him de-facto control of electoral votes that could swing a presidential election.,2020-06-26 19:09:09,Twitter Web App,16,29
Without its repeal the smaller federal district still retains its three electoral votes effectively giving the remaining residents – the First Family – three Electoral Votes for president.,2020-06-26 19:09:09,Twitter Web App,6,25
Secondly and most crucially the bill shrinks the federal district without immediately repealing the 23rd Amendment.,2020-06-26 19:09:08,Twitter Web App,6,29

The Democrat bill operates under the assumption that all members of law enforcement are bad and I believe that is wrong.,2020-06-26 00:51:05,Twitter Web App,2,10

This should be an open and transparent process that allows for debate and input but it should be noted that Republicans on the Judiciary Committee offered a dozen amendments to improve the bill and all were rejected by Democrats at every turn.,2020-06-26 00:51:03,Twitter Web App,0,5
I was hopeful that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would deliver a bill that could both offer solutions and become law but what passed the House today was overly partisan and will not make it to the President's desk.,2020-06-26 00:51:03,Twitter Web App,0,5
Finally the bill makes lynching a federal crime which I have previously supported in the House. In many cases these high standards are already in practice by Alaska’s law enforcement agencies.,2020-06-26 00:51:03,Twitter Web App,0,5
The JUSTICE Act also closes the so-called “consent loophole” making it unlawful for an officer to engage in a sexual act with a detained suspect something the Democrat bill surprisingly does not address.,2020-06-26 00:51:03,Twitter Web App,0,6
Additionally it bans the use of choke holds provides funding for body cameras and storage for footage and expands de-escalation training for police departments.,2020-06-26 00:51:02,Twitter Web App,0,5
