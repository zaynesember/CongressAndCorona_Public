What is at stake in Nov? AOC said that she can "likely push VP Biden in a more progressive direction across policy issues.” Joe Biden is a decoy candidate. He's a shill for the far-left and their radical agenda. This ballot is about freedom vs. socialism. https://t.co/j7prusOfyP,2020-09-18 20:23:57,Twitter for iPhone,1,1
