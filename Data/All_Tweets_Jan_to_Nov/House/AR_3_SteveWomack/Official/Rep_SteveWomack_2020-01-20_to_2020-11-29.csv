We established discretionary spending caps for fiscal years 2020 and 2021. We adhered to those caps in the FY2020 appropriations bills and I can tell you that it’s troubling to me – and it should be troubling to all Americans – that we are busting through those caps in 2021. https://t.co/frsf7AiWFb,2020-07-09 19:29:00,Twitter Web App,4,8
Madam Chair I oppose the 302(b)s proposed here today. Last year both parties negotiated the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019. We had to do that because House Dems didn’t pass a budget. The lack of a budget is a serious breach of our duty as a Congress. https://t.co/6sXpkQxLCY,2020-07-09 19:27:16,Twitter Web App,4,4
I rose in opposition to the House Dems proposal to breach spending caps at the House Appropriations Committee markup.

We need to reclaim our authority and bring credibility back to the budget and appropriations process. Our budget process was written in the 1970's - and it does not align with the dynamics of the modern Congress. cc: @ModernizeCmte,2020-03-11 15:19:37,Twitter Web App,3,7
Additionally we have surrendered our authority to unchecked mandatory spending. A majority of federal spending is currently running on auto-pilot - without limit or approval. It’s exactly the opposite of what our Constitution prescribes.,2020-03-11 15:19:37,Twitter Web App,3,3
Congress has not followed regular order - adopting a budget resolution conference report and separate annual appropriations bills before the start of the subsequent fiscal year - since 1995. That’s nearly 25 years of dysfunction. https://t.co/rpgxhbR2Vr,2020-03-11 15:19:37,Twitter Web App,6,8
