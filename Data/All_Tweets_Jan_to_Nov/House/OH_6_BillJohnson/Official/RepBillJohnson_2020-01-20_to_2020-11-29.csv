This has to be an across-the-board all hands-on-deck effort and we’ve got to use the latest available technology. Telehealth can quickly expand the reach of high quality healthcare and it should be a part of the coronavirus solution.  https://t.co/8bsHrGIRNT,2020-02-28 17:55:42,Twitter Web App,0,4

This bill is ridiculous. We need to vet who’s coming in our country especially now. Redirecting wall funding is conterproductive and an attempt to score cheap political points.
