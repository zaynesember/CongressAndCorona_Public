Like @HouseDemocrats have said before the American people know what a fair trial looks like and they want to hear from witnesses. @senatemajldr- it is time to represent the American people and include witnesses in the trial. https://t.co/hQb2N7mgeK,2020-01-31 14:42:00,TweetDeck,14,56

The President may be ignoring the contributions of @HouseDemocrats but USMCA is a reality because of @SpeakerPelosi's  work to improve it.

"Send these the homeless tempest-tost to me I lift my lamp beside the golden door!"  For decades these words greeted immigrants as they entered New York harbor. The President's new immigration policy goes against everything it means to be American. https://t.co/C2LvfxLtT4,2020-01-28 15:56:16,TweetDeck,8,30
Now we know why @realDonaldTrump blocked John Bolton from testifying.  Let's be clear: Any failure by Senate Republicans to call him as a witness is a failure of constitutional responsibility. https://t.co/6UWvlZOLdB,2020-01-28 14:55:00,TweetDeck,49,165

Rather than engaging on the facts President Trump's lawyers have chosen to distract and obfuscate. You deserve the truth. Follow @HouseIntel for live fact-checking through every day of the White House's presentation. https://t.co/tTw9xOYrUI,2020-01-27 21:08:14,TweetDeck,24,61

The NRA’s political spending is nearly 14x higher than before #CitizensUnited &amp; it was the top dark money contributor in 2016.

The American people trust our intelligence community to operate largely in the dark. If we want to maintain that trust the President cannot ask them to only parrot his preferred talking points. https://t.co/zdOdeAQYmn,2020-01-21 17:20:00,TweetDeck,6,32
