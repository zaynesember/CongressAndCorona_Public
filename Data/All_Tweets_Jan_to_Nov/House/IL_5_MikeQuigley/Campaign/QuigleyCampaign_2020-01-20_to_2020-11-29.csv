There are some extended early voting hours this weekend if you would like to vote before Tuesday but I have full confidence that our election infrastructure will run smoothly. Exercise your right to vote because obviously choosing competent political leaders matters! https://t.co/eu12eMco1b,2020-03-14 16:50:22,Twitter Web App,18,22
I am honored to endorse @yonipizer for State Representative. I’ve known Yoni for many years and I’ve seen up close his commitment to our community and constituents. There’s no one who would be a stronger louder or prouder voice in Springfield! https://t.co/LBQVMOsu1O,2020-02-24 17:57:17,Twitter Web App,4,6
