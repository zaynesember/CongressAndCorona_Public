#WorkingFamilies across the U.S. are desperate. @HouseDemocrats voted to #ExtendUI at $600/wk in May &amp; @SenateGOP has ignored us.

The #CARESAct — passed in March by @HouseDemocrats — provided billions for housing grants during #COVID19.  @CountyofLA has been awarded an additional $39166408 to help with:  🏡 Housing access and improvements  🏡 Public services like testing and nutritious meal programs https://t.co/fbHwPaxW4J,2020-09-11 18:50:27,Twitter for iPhone,2,3

Career @uscensusbureau officials have been clear: They NEED more time for the #2020Census.  But @realDonaldTrump still plans to rush this count costing districts like #CA34 millions over the next ten years.  @SenateGOP must pass a #Census deadline extension immediately. https://t.co/k0DNsFa4V4,2020-09-11 01:47:23,Twitter for iPhone,3,7

Our Conspiracy Theorist in Chief continues to spew baseless claims about #COVID19 to win re-election and cover for his own incompetence. It’s dangerous.

On #EarthDay remember that #Census2020 data will determine where funds go needed to keep our drinking water safe &amp; our skies clean.

Undocumented immigrant college students:  ▪️Pay taxes ▪️Contribute to society ▪️Are a vital part of our community  But @BetsyDeVosED thinks economic aid should ONLY benefit citizens.  She’s wrong.

No silver bullet will fix the economic damage of #COVID19 but as a former employee of @Target &amp; @SUBWAY I call on Congress to prioritize hourly/gig workers to ensure they’re supported while off the job &amp; have a job to return to when this is all behind us. https://t.co/nLfibEYziw,2020-03-18 00:26:34,Twitter for iPhone,15,37
Words matter.  How we characterize this crisis matters.  And our immigrant communities — who have experienced racist backlashes in the wake of the #COVID19 pandemic — matter.  I represent #Koreatown #Chinatown and other #API communities. And I don’t take things like this lightly. https://t.co/LKwwxSNzck,2020-03-17 21:45:34,Twitter for iPhone,23,94
I look forward to reviewing this plan line by line because details matter.  Congress should prioritize the following:  ▶️ Independent contractors/gig employees  ▶️ Hourly workers  ▶️ Small businesses  ▶️ Industries that are forced to close or reduce hours to protect #PublicHealth https://t.co/sOgvVFuamJ,2020-03-17 19:42:48,Twitter for iPhone,1,8
To our immigrant communities:  @USCIS announced that any #COVID19 testing treatment or service won’t be used against you in your #PublicCharge evaluation.

Why does @senatemajldr refuse to bring #HR1 — passed by @HouseDemocrats last year — up for a vote?

In a matter of weeks @realDonaldTrump’s characterization of #RogerStone’s involvement in his campaign has evolved (to put it nicely).

The #PublicChargeRule — in effect now — makes it even harder for immigrants to obtain legal status if they use public benefits like #SNAP &amp; housing vouchers.

Today marks 2 years since the deadliest high school shooting in US history.   During the course of 6+ min 17 lives were taken &amp; a community was forever changed.

Voting to PASS the #ERA resolution was a no-brainer.  Don’t forget:  ▪️Women still earn only 80 cents for every dollar men earn  ▪️@realDonaldTrump’s administration threatens #WomensHealth everyday  ▪️Women deserve stronger workplace protections  @senatemajldr: You’re up! #ERANow https://t.co/z8Bp9McYey,2020-02-13 18:33:50,Twitter for iPhone,28,61
Republicans are mailing deceptive documents disguised as official #2020Census forms right before the Census gets underway.  Why? To suppress the count of those who oppose @realDonaldTrump.  I asked @uscensusbureau Director how he’s addressing this in our @OversightDems hearing ⬇️ https://t.co/W3vtTjhppI,2020-02-13 16:22:19,Twitter Media Studio,91,111
I’m a member of Congress &amp; I’m still paying off my #StudentLoans but that pales in comparison to the crushing #StudentDebt facing #WorkingFamilies &amp; food-insecure communities. If @realDonaldTrump thinks this will help address the #StudentDebtCrisis he needs to go back to school. https://t.co/xwp09WPSfB,2020-02-12 22:41:13,Twitter for iPhone,19,47
This is ANOTHER abuse of power by @realDonaldTrump this time facilitated by the nation’s top law enforcement official.  #WilliamBarr was appointed to serve as Attorney General not this president’s personal lawyer &amp; enabler.  I don’t believe he can faithfully fulfill his duties. https://t.co/PjKu8KMufB,2020-02-12 18:15:05,Twitter for iPhone,8,15
During times when we’re seeing a 120% jump nationwide in circulated white supremacist propaganda between 2018-2019 we need a #POTUS who clearly and consistently speaks out against hate. https://t.co/yG5ophIgp7,2020-02-12 15:32:27,Twitter for iPhone,7,7
GREAT NEWS for #CA34!  Happy to announce @USDOT will be giving @metrolosangeles $100000000 for the Regional Connector Light Rail project!

Heard republicans hail the #GOPTaxScam in our @WaysMeansCmte hearing on the disappearing corporate income tax &amp; I had to ask:  What are they talking about?  Companies like @amazon pay NOTHING in taxes while #WorkingFamilies are left behind!  @HouseGOP: Stop celebrating &amp; wake up. https://t.co/nzonNUQzqf,2020-02-12 00:02:49,Twitter for iPhone,65,127
Remember when @realDonaldTrump meddled in the case of #MichaelFlynn who pleaded guilty of lying to @FBI?  He’s at it again this time with his convict pal #RogerStone. And he used Attorney General #BillBarr — who has clearly been comprised — as his lackey. https://t.co/nAziD1aRVd,2020-02-11 21:59:23,Twitter for iPhone,17,32
At a briefing on food insecurity on community college campuses I discussed my bill — the EATS Act — to expand #SNAP eligibility to college students &amp; my own experience as a #WorkingClass student at @RCCOutreach.

Question: What’s the ONLY democracy to deprive its citizens of #EqualRights for living in the nation’s capital?  Answer: 🇺🇸    700k #DC residents don’t have a vote in Congress.

Need ANOTHER reminder this president is a liar?  Look at the new #TrumpBudget.  This is what @realDonaldTrump meant when he said he was “helping” people get off #SNAP benefits:  Cutting the program by $182 BILLION!  That’s not help. That’s a disaster for #WorkingClass Americans. https://t.co/DQ5c1bz543,2020-02-10 20:56:03,Twitter for iPhone,11,22
I’m no fan of @MittRomney but I did respect his vote to convict @realDonaldTrump on abuse of power.  @mschlapp’s fear for Sen Romney’s safety at @CPAC speaks volumes about Trump’s corrosive impact on the GOP.  Tough votes come with the territory. They shouldn’t put you in danger. https://t.co/X2gtPuBGlJ,2020-02-10 18:54:01,Twitter for iPhone,5,17
Funny how @realDonaldTrump is ALWAYS eager to give disaster relief to areas that support him while turning his back on #PuertoRico &amp; treating it as if it were a foreign country unworthy of our support.  @HouseDemocrats haven’t forgotten about our Puerto Rican brothers &amp; sisters. https://t.co/U3Bwg2xlIn,2020-02-08 19:22:51,Twitter for iPhone,16,26

Miss the #SOTU this week? Don't worry it was nothing more than a campaign rally riddled with lies. It's the kind of absurdity one expects from a reality tv personality turned #POTUS.  Here's my take on what I can only describe as a nationally televised @realDonaldTrump circus ⬇️ https://t.co/6HCpjfut2v,2020-02-08 00:02:17,Twitter Media Studio,5,21
Lt. Col. Alex Vindman embodies what it means to be a patriot bravely shinning a light on @realDonaldTrump’s abuses of power.  Lt. Col. Vindman’s treatment by this president and his administration was nothing short of shameful.  Dedicated public servants like him deserve better. https://t.co/2m56kOAJ57,2020-02-07 22:46:43,Twitter for iPhone,6,22
Some of this year's #Oscars snubs:  🎬 @thefarewell  🎥 #DolemiteIsMyName  🎞 @JLo in @HustlersMovie  5 years after #OscarsSoWhite and stories about women and people of color STILL aren’t being recognized on Hollywood's biggest night.  Recognition matters.  #RepresentationMatters https://t.co/A7cz0GNQmt,2020-02-07 19:41:25,Twitter for iPhone,8,11
Gun violence continues to cripple communities across the nation. As a @HouseGVP member this issue is one of my TOP priorities. @HouseDemocrats passed #HR8 to expand background checks almost a year ago. @senatemajldr needs to do the same. #EndGunViolence #GunViolenceSurvivorsWeek https://t.co/WOR09GQcw7,2020-02-07 18:33:56,Twitter for iPhone,5,4
Voted YES on the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act because:  🔹Hard work should be recognized &amp; rewarded  🔹Those who represent the backbone of our economy need the right to form a union  🔹American workers deserve higher wages better benefits &amp; safer working conditions https://t.co/HEiqwgsTNe,2020-02-07 03:18:38,Twitter for iPhone,23,89
FEAR  It’s the vehicle @realDonaldTrump uses to sell his policies. He says:  ▫️Immigrants are dangerous!  ▫️Democrats want to take away all your money!  ▫️Fighting #ClimateChange = socialism!  All false. All fear-mongering.  Now he’s used it against @SenateGOP for his acquittal. https://t.co/mE3sTNz4tV,2020-02-06 21:40:44,Twitter for iPhone,3,11
A #2020Census job not only means competitive wages weekly paychecks and flexible hours but it also means playing a valuable role in ensuring EVERYONE is accurately counted and has a voice in our democracy.

I refuse to acknowledge the term #ConversionTherapy.

For those who care about our country &amp; the rule of law @realDonaldTrump’s Senate acquittal is a tough pill to swallow.  But despite @SenateGOP’s political cowardice I’ll continue doing everything in my power as @OversightDems Vice Chair to hold this administration accountable. https://t.co/JFLI69bD2R,2020-02-05 21:33:35,Twitter for iPhone,10,49
The #AffordableHousing crisis hits every demographic &amp; age group especially children.  @realDonaldTrump could join @HouseDemocrats in addressing the issue. Instead his proposed regulations are making matters worse.   That’s why @OversightDems are taking on this critical issue. https://t.co/M0Csy55ZCr https://t.co/8YLeEOCy9E,2020-02-05 19:45:01,Twitter for iPhone,7,8

A woman deserves the right to consult with HER doctor on what is best for HER body.  @HouseDemocrats will NOT stand idly by as this administration attempts to criminalize abortion and jeopardize the health and safety of women across America. #SOTU https://t.co/TFnyLtq5V0,2020-02-05 03:23:33,Twitter Web App,8,48
#SanctuaryCities &amp; states are safer places BECAUSE of these laws.  They don’t just protect immigrants. They heighten public safety for everyone.  What @realDonaldTrump is talking about isn’t only false it’s dangerous rhetoric that echoes the most hateful elements of our country. https://t.co/KZ54YIMTBo,2020-02-05 03:10:50,Twitter Web App,7,27
Our country needs a real #PaidFamilyLeave policy like the one I championed in the California State Legislature.  What @realDonaldTrump and his @HouseGOP supporters are proposing is a loan.  That doesn't help #WorkingFamilies.  America deserves better! https://t.co/BSrKpuTKHl,2020-02-05 02:59:11,Twitter Web App,17,28
I thought @realdonaldTrump wanted to "build new roads bridges tunnels highways bigger better faster."  Then why did he walk away from #Infrastructure talks in 2019?  @HouseDemocrats have an infrastructure plan to create jobs reduce pollution and grow our economy. #SOTU,2020-02-05 02:58:10,Twitter Web App,6,12
What "wall" was @realDonaldTrump talking about?  It can't be the one Mexico was supposed to pay for because they've vowed NEVER to put a dime toward that hate-filled vanity project.  He must be talking about the one where he stole money from our military projects to build.  #SOTU,2020-02-05 02:47:17,Twitter Web App,18,41
Under @realDonaldTrump prescription drug prices have gone up exponentially preventing #WorkingFamilies from getting the care they need.  @HouseDemocrats will NOT let this president continue his attacks on our constituents' access to high quality &amp; affordable #HealthCare. #SOTU,2020-02-05 02:46:57,Twitter Web App,7,20
When @realDonaldTrump hails #BeBest I think he means as long as the children don't care about saving this planet from #ClimateChange...  https://t.co/ndofhC7UYX,2020-02-05 02:46:22,Twitter Web App,3,7
Don't be fooled: @realDonaldTrump is NOT looking out for Americans living with #preexisting conditions.  Never has. Never will.  He's been urging federal courts to dismantle the #AffordableCareAct which includes protections for people living with #preexisting conditions.  #SOTU,2020-02-05 02:42:42,Twitter Web App,286,759
It's hard to believe @realDonaldTrump actually wants to work with Congress when the man won’t even give @SpeakerPelosi the respect of a handshake!  Under her leadership @HouseDemocrats passed hundreds of bipartisan bills #ForThePeople. And we're just getting started. #SOTU https://t.co/y86kuKpJcG,2020-02-05 02:38:52,Twitter Web App,5,22
The very notion that @realDonaldTrump is "helping" people get off #SNAP is gaslighting at its very worst.  The only people he helped are the top 1% of this country.  In reality he's kicking #WorkingAmericans off these benefits and endangering their lives.  #FactsMatter #SOTU https://t.co/Ok8lmPxSsE,2020-02-05 02:26:38,Twitter Web App,126,324
The harmful tariffs and crippling trade wars @realdonaldtrump spurred hurt hardworking #American families to the tune of over $1000 a year.  @HouseDemocrats fixed his weak #USMCA deal to work for all Americans.  No more loopholes no more massive giveaways to #BigPharma. #SOTU,2020-02-05 02:24:47,Twitter Web App,3,12
The "tremendous progress" @realDonaldTrump is talking about when it comes to oil and energy comes at the expense of our #PublicLands.  Our public lands are NOT for sale to polluters or anybody who wants to take away our #CleanAir and #CleanWater. #SOTU,2020-02-05 02:24:32,Twitter Web App,8,31
The #MinimumWage hasn't increased in 10+ YEARS!  It's time we #RaiseTheWage to to help all #WorkingFamilies support their children with ONE job - not two three or four.  Not surprised @realdonaldtrump doesn't get it. The man wouldn't know hard work if it hit him the face. #SOTU,2020-02-05 02:18:51,Twitter Web App,8,25
Maria Meza’s daughter - my #SOTU guest - came to our country with her mother and siblings in search of a better life.  What’s her version of the American Dream?

Tonight we’ll hear from @realDonaldTrump at the #SOTU.  Will he offer real solutions to our nation's most pressing issues like #ClimateChange #GunViolence &amp; #AffordableHousing or pretend everything’s fine while acting as if he’s above the law?  I think we all know the answer...,2020-02-05 00:40:45,Twitter for iPhone,6,9
What is the #StateOfHealthCare?  @realDonaldTrump &amp; @HouseGOP are sabotaging access to affordable #HealthCare.  @HouseDemocrats are working to #ProtectOurCare by:  🔹 Lowering drug costs 🔹 Protecting people with #preexisting conditions 🔹 Expanding care to millions of Americans https://t.co/Kt5wRq2SCB,2020-02-04 21:12:36,Twitter for iPhone,54,94
