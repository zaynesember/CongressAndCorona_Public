great idea! @CountyofLA should follow San Diego’s example.   When gov’t takes steps to limit social activities to protect public health it must also take steps to provide financial support to businesses &amp; people.

As someone who opposed the 710 extension I know CalTrans has mismanaged these properties &amp; situation for decades. And their actions over the last several days demonstrate that.

Found this note in my DC office from @RepKarenBass thanking me for voting for the #GeorgeFloyd Justice in Policing Act.    It’s an additional reminder that the fight 4 justice is still not done.

In 2003 I finished grad school w/$85k in student loans. I still have $45k to pay off.  Today it’s a LOT worse for students.    Although I’m very fortunate to not need loan forgiveness many people do need the help!

.@AOC agreed! I actually have a bill that you are an original cosponsor of For the 99.8 percent Act which would raise trillions of dollars by taxing those who inherit their wealth. The money could be used to forgive student loan debt and finance tuition-free public college. https://t.co/ejAp0ZVb5y,2020-11-16 18:42:16,Twitter for iPhone,20,234

VP Pence is becoming more and more like Trump.  That’s why he is being so disrespectful to the moderator.  I guess that’s what happens when your side is losing.  #VPDebate,2020-10-08 02:04:15,Twitter for iPhone,16,102

That’s correct. “Too little support” doesn’t get people the help they need and will only lead to more economic pain in the short and long run.

.@LACountyRRCC doesn't think there are any issues with the new e-vote machine's flawed ballot.  If you are in L.A. &amp; voting in person share your voting story!  Retweet or DM me: 1. Where did you vote? and 2. Did poll workers tell you to push the MORE button or hand you a flyer?,2020-02-28 20:08:41,Twitter Web App,13,26
@LACountyRRCC still has time to inform every voter that not all candidates show on the screen &amp; to press the “MORE” button.
