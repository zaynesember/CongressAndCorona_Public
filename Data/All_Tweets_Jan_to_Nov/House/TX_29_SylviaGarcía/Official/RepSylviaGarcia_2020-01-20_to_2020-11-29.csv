5/ The blatant disregard for safety to score political points could not be clearer and it goes against our values as Americans. #HoldICEAccountable  Read my full statement: https://t.co/83nMSnQoZg,2020-09-11 21:30:46,Twitter Web App,16,40
4/ There is no excuse for the Trump administration to fly immigrant detainees to Virginia to facilitate the rapid deployment of Homeland Security tactical teams to quell peaceful protests in Washington.,2020-09-11 21:30:45,Twitter Web App,10,33
3/ It appears this decision to transport detainees to Virginia was politically motivated which resulted in a COVID-19 outbreak in an immigration facility in Farmville VA that infected more than 300 detainees one of whom died.,2020-09-11 21:30:45,Twitter Web App,10,26
2/ Although the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) claims that ‘during COVID-19 the agency has taken steps to protect detainees in its custody and promote social distancing whenever possible’ their actions speak louder than words.,2020-09-11 21:30:45,Twitter Web App,8,23

19 years ago the world watched in horror as we were attacked by terrorists.  We were tested as a country but we showed the world the resilience and strength of America.

We cannot allow the Senate GOP to once again leave out mixed-status families from receiving much needed #COVID19 relief.  This virus is affecting everyone and does not care about immigration status.

5/ The City of Houston has 5300 police officers and the vast majority of them do an excellent job in keeping our community safe. I thank them for their service but holding officers accountable for wrongdoing does not take away from this.,2020-09-10 22:51:18,Twitter for iPhone,2,20
4/ In the final seconds of this encounter the question is whether or not Nicolas Chavez was an imminent threat to any of the officers or the general public.  And in this case it appears there was no imminent threat. He should’ve  lived to receive the help he needed that day.,2020-09-10 22:51:17,Twitter for iPhone,3,14
3/ It’s made us question what the HPD can do differently to deescalate situations and avoid excessive force when at all possible.  And unfortunately I agree with Mayor Sylvester Turner and Police Chief Art Acevedo in their decision to fire the four officers in this case.,2020-09-10 22:51:16,Twitter for iPhone,0,12
2/ I know today is a difficult day for all of us especially for the Nicolas Chavez family the Houston Police Department and our city.   The footage from that day is difficult to watch.,2020-09-10 22:51:15,Twitter for iPhone,1,11

4/ This case led to the desegregation of juries nationwide and recognized that Mexican Americans were protected under the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Salas Aldaz passed away in 1982. #LatinoTrailblazers #BirthdayBuddies,2020-09-06 17:57:51,Twitter for iPhone,1,5
3/ This LULAC chapter was one of the most active in the 1940’s-1960’s fighting for Mexican American rights in Texas and beyond. It’s the same LULAC chapter that eventually brought the Hernandez v. Texas case to the Supreme Court. https://t.co/76f9RkYxbh,2020-09-06 17:57:50,Twitter for iPhone,1,6

About 1 in 4 students in the Houston region who’re at or below the poverty line don’t have access to technology or internet.

This July in TX 25% of adults reported that children in their households weren’t eating enough because they couldn’t afford it.  TX families deserve better!

Bolton could’ve testified during the House impeachment inquiry and Senate trial.   Instead he put the success of his book over our democracy.

Here are some highlights of my remarks from today's @HouseJudiciary hearing on the #GeorgeFloyd #JusticeInPolicing Act.

1/ I commend the Supreme Court on their 6-3 decision in Bostock v. Clayton County Georgia which makes it clear that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects #LGBTQ workers from discrimination in the workplace.,2020-06-15 17:51:42,Twitter for iPhone,25,112

We have an obligation to care for the most vulnerable among us esp. during a crisis. That’s why I joined @SenKamalaHarris &amp; @RepEscobar in calling on HHS/DHS to release nearly 2400 detained immigrant children. Prolonging their detention will only risk their lives. Nothing else. https://t.co/guTT6mg8uD,2020-04-23 01:12:09,Twitter for iPhone,77,244

“But honestly we have all the material. They don’t have the material.”  The President’s words show why we need to see ALL the documents and hear from ALL the witnesses.  He’s obstructed Congress because he’s guilty.  He must be held accountable. Period.  https://t.co/nr8U7cpaD9,2020-01-22 17:04:59,Twitter for iPhone,2236,5437
Today is the anniversary of #RoevWade a decision that made it clear that women have a Constitutional right to choose.  Now more than ever we MUST protect the right of all people to have access to comprehensive reproductive healthcare. https://t.co/J3rEVMikse,2020-01-22 14:15:51,Twitter Web App,149,351
Trump got caught and then he tried to cover it up.  We can’t let the Senate cover up his wrongdoing.  The Senate must hold a fair trial. https://t.co/ZbrGZqzifU,2020-01-22 13:43:45,Twitter for iPhone,131,380
The @senatemajldr made clear the White House strategy—hear no evil see no evil speak no evil.   They don’t want to hear any witnesses or see any documents and they want to bury that vote until the very end.  The American people deserve better than this.,2020-01-22 07:18:55,Twitter for iPhone,1395,4102
We need to hold President Trump accountable because no one is above the law.  Nadie está encima de la ley.   No yo o los otros fiscales.   No los Senadores.   Ni siquiera el Presidente.  ¡Nadie! https://t.co/bexiH0Piqs,2020-01-22 04:29:31,Twitter Media Studio,676,2291
La Oficina de Gestiones y Presupuesto de EE. UU. (OMB en inglés) tuvo un rol importante en el plan corrupto del presidente para corromper nuestras elecciones para su beneficio personal y político.   El Senado tiene un deber de asegurar que esto sea un juicio justo.,2020-01-22 00:55:23,Twitter for iPhone,18,44
El Senado debe citar los documentos del departamento de estados.   Estos documentos demostrarían como funcionarios como Pompeo Mulvaney y otros ayudaron al presidente Trump con su plan corrupto para corromper nuestras elecciones.   La gente americana quiere ver estos documentos.,2020-01-22 00:51:08,Twitter for iPhone,35,85
With the Constitution on our side my fellow impeachment managers and I will fulfill our solemn duty to uphold and defend our democracy.  Despite efforts to cover up the President’s wrong doing we’ll ensure the American people learn the truth.  We owe it to the American people. https://t.co/xy4sHx56Bu,2020-01-21 18:12:37,Twitter for iPhone,547,2193
McConnell is trying to hold the impeachment trial in the dead of night.  The American people want and the Constitution requires a fair trial.  https://t.co/jW0lTVWaw3,2020-01-21 15:30:29,Twitter for iPhone,83,172
Necesitamos un juicio justo — justo para el presidente si pero igual de importante justo para la gente americana.  Un juicio justo incluye documentos y testigos.  Un juicio sin documentos y testigos no es un juicio. Es un encubrimiento.  La gente del país se merece algo mejor.,2020-01-21 13:36:25,Twitter for iPhone,37,67
There should be a fair trial — fair to the President yes but equally important fair to the American people.   A fair trial includes documents and witnesses.  A trial without documents and witnesses is not a trial.  It is a coverup.  The American people deserve better.,2020-01-21 13:28:09,Twitter for iPhone,640,1928
Trump’s response to the articles of impeachment threatens our government’s system of checks and balances. Despite obstructing Congress we uncovered overwhelming evidence that proves he engaged in the trifecta of constitutional misconduct warranting removal.  #DefendOurDemocracy https://t.co/FNJMyZtgNT,2020-01-20 22:01:12,Twitter for iPhone,276,560

Mr. President we asked Bolton to testify but you ordered him not to and blocked others like Mulvaney.  You got caught and have obstructed this process from the start.  Americans know that a fair trial includes witnesses and documents.  What’re you hiding? https://t.co/hHEFD50njc,2020-01-20 17:54:29,Twitter for iPhone,1836,5459
On this #MLKDay I can’t help but think about these powerful words by Martin Luther King Jr: “The time is always right to do what is right.”  These words will guide me in my role as an impeachment manger. It’s time to do what is right by defending our Constitution and democracy.,2020-01-20 15:15:50,Twitter for iPhone,209,732
Couldn’t agree more.  We need a partner in government not a golf buddy. https://t.co/184SyoDSHA,2020-01-20 01:17:10,Twitter for iPhone,38,156
