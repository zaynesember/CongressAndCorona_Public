With the election behind us it’s time for Republicans and Democrats to put politics aside and come together to solve our problems. We should start by providing additional Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) relief for our small businesses. Read my latest:  https://t.co/8VOkgy7bUf,2020-11-25 20:31:32,Twitter for iPhone,1,4
I am fighting for our small businesses. It's time for Pelosi to stop her obstruction so we can get relief passed.  "On Thursday Democrats prevented the House from considering Rep. Steve Chabot’s (R-OH) legislation H.R. 8265 which would reopen the PPP."  https://t.co/9gaEKxdH6X,2020-11-20 18:17:59,Twitter Web App,2,3
Nancy Pelosi must stop her partisan obstruction so we can reopen the Paycheck Protection Program and get struggling small businesses and their workers the support they need now. #PPP #SmallBusiness   https://t.co/ECLj2LQaAB,2020-11-20 18:14:07,Twitter Web App,4,8

In 48 hours @KateForCongress' dishonest campaign has been called out for spreading “false information” and for "wrongly" attacking Steve Chabot by The Cincinnati Enquirer and https://t.co/QsCmq8RaVj — and been caught promoting a plan to "illegally harvest ballots." Tough week.,2020-08-28 15:40:46,Twitter Web App,47,34
Kate Schroder is so afraid of voters learning the truth about her record of scandal at the Board of Health or about her radical positions like supporting the Green New Deal that she is willing to say anything no matter how false to deflect attention.  https://t.co/d4dxfCCRvF,2020-08-27 18:25:33,Twitter for iPhone,10,16
