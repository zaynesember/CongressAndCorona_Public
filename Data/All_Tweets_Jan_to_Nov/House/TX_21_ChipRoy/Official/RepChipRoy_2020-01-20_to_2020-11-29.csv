Whatever Congress decides to do it will be mostly for not unless we give Americans a path towards reopening (and one that starts soon). The pursuit of happiness is a very real thing. We can't keep changing the goal posts and hiding in fear.,2020-05-15 16:00:08,Twitter for iPhone,12,11
I have a bipartisan bill that would pass overwhelmingly if the speaker put it on the floor tomorrow. How do I know that? The speaker has included every piece of my bill in her $3 trillion partisan monstrosity. Enough politics. Let's work together. https://t.co/Ps1rrnCcja,2020-05-15 16:00:08,Twitter for iPhone,13,13
First a bill to allow proxy voting and (AFTER THAT) ... a $3 trillion package stuffed with progressive policies (limitless illegal work payments to illegal immigrants permanent federalization of elections) that will assuredly fail. She's wasting everyone's time.,2020-05-15 16:00:07,Twitter for iPhone,6,5
As a result of those flaws and no leadership on economic restart we learned this week that a staggering 36.5 million Americans have filed for unemployment in the past two months. More businesses are closing. More families can't put food on the table. The speaker's response?,2020-05-15 16:00:07,Twitter for iPhone,8,6
That evening again with strong reservations I voted yes on the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act. I tried to offer an amendment to the bill to fix the flaws I wrote to Treasury / in WSJ about but @HouseDemocrats blocked it. https://t.co/Mi8JNvkUsX,2020-05-15 16:00:07,Twitter for iPhone,8,6
On April 23 in an effort to bring more attention to the fact that government action was killing America's restaurant industry I wrote a joint op-ed in @WSJ w/ the president and CEO of the Texas Restaurant Association. https://t.co/iThSvfoisd,2020-05-15 16:00:07,Twitter for iPhone,5,4
Around the same time it became clear that the mechanism -- PPP loan program -- we used in CARES to provide relief for small businesses was flawed. I wrote to @stevenmnuchin1 on April 16 requesting some Treasury guidance fixing those problems. None came. https://t.co/O1NWzRt5qP,2020-05-15 16:00:06,Twitter for iPhone,5,4
On April 4 I wrote in @FoxNews about the very real second and third order impacts of tens of million Americans unemployed. Some of these things unfortunately we are starting to see play out. All the while we still had no plan to reopen society. https://t.co/tVmvlxSr5I,2020-05-15 16:00:06,Twitter for iPhone,8,4
None of that seemed to bug Congress though. @SpeakerPelosi kept us home for months.

In the coming weeks we'd start watching our local institutions shut down many for good. Our neighbors were being laid off.

I said I would have supported it w/ strong reservations about its complexity scope and a serious concern that an infusion of capital to workers and businesses is only going to be effective if we have a path back to economic function. We did not.,2020-05-15 16:00:06,Twitter for iPhone,5,5
On March 27 The senate sent over a $2 trillion #CARESAct that included a provision that paid people more to work than not to work. We didn’t get a chance to amend it let alone vote on it. Bc government has closed down businesses we had an obligation to help them bridge the gap,2020-05-15 16:00:05,Twitter for iPhone,6,7
On March 20 I wrote in @NRO about why it was imperative for our leadership to give Americans a very clear mission — and a quick date certain by which to carry it out — to get the health-care situation under control and get our economy back to normal. https://t.co/T6AHhkZICT,2020-05-15 16:00:05,Twitter for iPhone,131,381

You shouldn’t be punished for keeping good employees.,2020-03-18 01:27:26,Twitter for iPhone,7,21

@RepJerryNadler is claiming the "Senate is on trial in the eyes of the American people." In reality his party failed to make its case and now wants the Senate to do it for them. That’s not how this works.  In my view once the cases are presented they should be dismissed.,2020-01-22 15:57:38,Twitter Web App,12,39
And more ... House Democrats sat on the Articles of Impeachment for 33 days to try to extract demands from the Senate because they knew the case they made was so weak it couldn't stand by itself.,2020-01-22 15:57:38,Twitter Web App,8,24
They refused to make proper subpoenas in the first place.  They pulled their subpoena of Kupperman rather than press their case regarding the dispute over executive privilege.   They could have pressed a subpoena for anyone they wanted. They didn't. They had complete control.,2020-01-22 15:57:38,Twitter Web App,10,31
If you are predisposed to believe the president engaged in conduct deserving of scrutiny blame the House Democrats for failing to do their job not the Senate.    @SpeakerPelosi rushed the case through to a partisan vote (losing Democrats gaining no Republicans).,2020-01-22 15:57:37,Twitter Web App,9,25
I spent almost two months re-directing my priorities in office to listen to depositions and determine if there was evidence presented meeting the constitutional requirement of “treason bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors." In my view no such evidence was presented.,2020-01-22 15:57:37,Twitter Web App,6,27
THREAD -- The fact that @HouseDemocrats spent the first day of the #ImpeachmentDay trial in the Senate focusing on the need for more witnesses to make their case underscores the very weakness of their own impeachment effort in the House. They screwed up and they know it.,2020-01-22 15:57:37,Twitter Web App,64,163

I know Texans like all Americans want to spend less time stuck in gridlock traffic and more time doing the things they enjoy.    Washington bureaucrats should stay in their lane. After all who knows the highways of Texas better than the Texans driving them every day.,2020-01-22 14:22:31,Twitter Web App,6,35
Today I filed H.R. 5660 the Highway Formula Fairness Act  Last year Texas only received 95 cents back for every dollar it sent to Washington in federal fuel taxes. The state was shortchanged by up to $940 million in FY 2019.,2020-01-22 14:22:31,Twitter Web App,61,97

...providing a clear mission for our military — these are the things I hear Texans talking about every day. Let’s do our job now.  One thing is clearly true: Americans will have the opportunity to make their choice in just over ten months. We should let them do it.,2020-01-21 16:16:11,Twitter Web App,10,37
The #impeachment process is over in the House. @speakerpelosi instead of rehashing it we should immediately turn our attention to solving any one of the significant issues that Americans care most about.
