@steve_vladeck Always fair. To be clear - I am not assuming anything re: the veracity of the emails. I have no idea about the authenticity. I do have legitimate concerns about the relationships what Biden knew and when he knew it. I did last year in committee.  But - yep appreciate exchange.,2020-10-16 15:59:11,Twitter for iPad,0,1

It’s worthy of scrutiny.,2020-10-16 15:50:53,Twitter for iPad,2,4
@steve_vladeck I don’t claim they are or are not authentic. I can’t know. What I want to know is more information. That’s it. I want to know whether the facts we know (Hunter Ukraine $ Biden pushing to fire prosecutor) have connection. I haven’t seen hard-nosed press on Bidens to clarify.,2020-10-16 15:47:32,Twitter for iPad,0,2

@steve_vladeck Steve assume you are right.  Why wouldn’t we want to know what the VP knew and whether he had direct involvement with Hunter’s dealings?

Avoids question:  1) Did Hunter take money?  (Yes).  2) Did Joe Biden know about it (seems likely). 3) Did Joe Biden have any involvement (seems possible) - and what was that and was it proper?  4) Did Joe Biden get a cut?  (Maybe).  #BidenAnswers https://t.co/I04578VjU6,2020-10-16 15:26:30,Twitter for iPad,38,127

@realDonaldTrump Ask yourself as you watch this hearing if this is a remotely reasonable response – or if perhaps instead Justice Thomas was right when he said of Senator Joe Biden when presiding over his hearing that "[he] had no idea what he was talking about." #ConfirmACB,2020-10-12 13:36:59,TweetDeck,9,24
@realDonaldTrump As the American people watch Judge Barrett answer questions – they should remember that the Washington Democrats view her as supposedly so “dangerous” as to require politicizing the Court by packing it full of additional judges in response. #ConfirmACB,2020-10-12 13:36:25,TweetDeck,2,7
@realDonaldTrump The role of the judge is truly to call balls and strikes and to leave the politics – and the policy making – to the Legislative and the Executive branches. #ConfirmACB,2020-10-12 13:35:21,TweetDeck,2,5
@realDonaldTrump This should spotlight the judges-as-superlegislature worldview by Democrats that have wrongly and dangerously politicized the Court for far too long. #ConfirmACB,2020-10-12 13:34:50,TweetDeck,3,5
@realDonaldTrump As the Judiciary Committee begins its hearing today Senate Dems will no doubt do at least 2 things: attack Judge Barrett for her personal beliefs and suggest that she has pre-judged future opinions by virtue of those beliefs and/or her nomination by President Trump. #ConfirmACB,2020-10-12 13:33:48,TweetDeck,3,5
