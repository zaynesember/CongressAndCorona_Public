My opponent Jill Schupp and her dark money DC supporters are intentionally misleading voters about my record.

My opponent Jill Schupp has never in her time in the state legislature passed a bill that she has authored. In contrast bills that I have authored have been signed into law by both President Obama and President Trump.,2020-10-12 02:55:27,Twitter Web App,16,43
Jill Schupp is supported by radical groups that want to defund our police. She has even voted against 5 public safety budgets during her time in the state legislature. Our police need to keep our communities safe we should be supporting them not defunding them. https://t.co/pk3OeYAK0T,2020-10-12 02:53:54,Twitter Web App,15,15
My opponent Jill Schupp is for Medicare for All she even introduced a bill supporting it twice. Medicare for All would be devastating to the healthcare of #MO02 and would cause nearly 90% to lose the coverage they currently have.,2020-10-12 02:51:21,Twitter Web App,16,38
During her 20 year career in government Jill Schupp has voted time after time to raise income taxes gas taxes and sales taxes. She even supported a 21% property tax increase when she was on the school board. Now is the time to ease the tax burden not increase it. #Fox2Forum,2020-10-12 02:48:48,Twitter Web App,13,20
