Rest in Power George Floyd.  Our hearts go out to the Floyd family today.  It shouldn't have required his murder to spur a national movement to end police violence.

This is disgusting.  We've all seen the video of a Martin Gugino being shoved by police &amp; bleeding from his head b/c of it.

And this tweet below - is how the President enables police violence. https://t.co/ZKzDFJKO72,2020-06-09 14:00:33,Twitter Web App,140,543

COVID-19 has forced farmers to toss millions of gallons of good milk/day.  I just authored the Farmer's MILK Act.  It authorizes the @USDA to pair dairy farmers with food banks.  Farmers get paid.

The country trusts information about this pandemic from our president just about as much they trust Fox News.   We need a leader we can trust to get us through this pandemic.  64% of the country don't think that's Donald Trump. https://t.co/0jFXvTBO3h,2020-05-12 14:52:54,Twitter for Android,13,41
The message from Dr. Fauci (emphasis on Doctor) is clear:   If we cut corners and reopen prematurely many more people will get sick many more people will die and we will have to start all over again.

The President is holding the @USPS hostage.  He wants to eliminate union jobs and charge families 4x more for packages.  The USPS shouldn't be a bargaining chip.

Before the pandemic Trump pushed for cuts to SNAP (Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program).  During this pandemic? His USDA has tried to force folks off SNAP.

We are seeing historic job loss—unlike anything we’ve seen since the Great Depression.  We have over 1.3 million COVID-19 cases in the U.S.  And now over 80000 deaths.

The U.S. unemployment rate hit 14.7% last month &amp; we lost 20.5 million jobs.  We haven't seen this kind of loss since the Great Depression.

This is a slice of what the @CDC has given WI compared to what we requested since 3/26.  &lt;1% of the requested reagent kits.  &lt;5% of plastic tips.  24% of Master Mixes.  How can we expand testing capacity if the best @CDC can do is &lt;1% of reagents we need to process tests? https://t.co/Y9QYXCbrFs,2020-04-23 22:04:40,Twitter Web App,35,52
I'm back in DC today.  But Wisconsinites back home are still suffering.  We've repeatedly asked this administration for more testing supplies.

Mr. President do your job. https://t.co/VoXLeCAHjq,2020-04-23 20:28:49,Twitter Media Studio,16,67

Wisconsin currently has 20 labs running 3756 tests/day.   6 labs have supply shortages.   43 labs can start testing if they get supplies.   We could have ~17000 tests/day.   What's missing?

In order to reopen the country everyone—including Trump—agrees it depends on our testing capacity.  Most experts say we need to be running at least 500000 tests/day.  Others say we need millions.

Less than a month into 2020 this president made a unilateral decision to assassinate an Iranian general without notification to or approval from Congress.

My guest to the #SOTU2020 is Kathy Honerbaum.

Tell me this @SenateGOP do you think in 10 years when they look back on how you've acted that they'll celebrate the first impeachment trial without witnesses defended by a lawyer who had firsthand knowledge of the crimes?
