Whip Clyburn is right. We can mourn for the trans people of color who needlessly lost their lives to hateful violence while we tear down the barriers to a good job education and health care that trans people face every day. https://t.co/q2OIJE4GIR,2020-11-23 21:10:00,Twitter Web App,4,15

I voted today to pass the National Apprenticeship Act which will greatly expand apprenticeship opportunities in the United States! https://t.co/hdhmKlSScJ,2020-11-21 01:09:00,Twitter Web App,4,26
We have to make sure apprentices know their rights are protected and that equal opportunities are given to take part in apprenticeships.

Public health measures without economic assistance will cost small businesses and family earnings. Economic assistance without public health measures is inefficient – no one is going to go to the mall if thousands of people are dying every day from a contagious disease.,2020-11-19 00:33:50,Twitter Web App,1,15

Recognizing Burma's 11/8 election as free and fair would legitimize the disenfranchisement of the Rohingya and &gt;1.5M others unable to participate.

I shared some thoughts on Facebook ahead of President Trump's visit to my district today.   https://t.co/qSLRsuq1Sn,2020-01-30 19:41:43,TweetDeck,2,7
This President has no plan to keep Americans safe or prevent another endless war that will cost billions of taxpayer $$ and most importantly American lives. Proud to vote to repeal the 2002 #AUMF &amp; prohibit funding for military action against #Iran not authorized by Congress.,2020-01-30 19:05:17,TweetDeck,5,27
“Let’s get to work. Let’s move some dirt.” - @GovWhitmer   So proud of our governor a problem solver with a plan. Outstanding job tonight at #MiSOTS20!,2020-01-30 01:46:06,Twitter for iPhone,3,20
The President has repeatedly broken his promise to protect workers and I am filled with concern that this trade deal will further hurt workers.   Read my full statement on the signing of the #USCMA: https://t.co/7urwHtZtM2,2020-01-29 15:55:58,TweetDeck,4,10
.@IsraeliPM: “Israel will apply its laws to the Jordan Valley and to the Jewish communities in Judea and Samaria."   The word you're looking for is "annex" and it means disaster for Israel's future as a democratic Jewish state and the Palestinian people.,2020-01-28 18:22:12,Twitter for iPhone,339,1360
Don't be fooled.  What @realDonaldTrump is proposing is a "two-state solution" in name only not lasting peace that will protect Israel's future as a democratic homeland for the Jewish people or fulfill Palestinians’ aspirations for self-determination.,2020-01-28 17:48:54,Twitter for iPhone,27,77
Do the American people really deserve to get the truth in slow leaks until they can download it on their kindle? Congress needs Bolton’s documents and his testimony. https://t.co/gnNfZttH0F,2020-01-28 02:39:01,Twitter for iPhone,12,68
Now we’re talking!! As I’ve told all the car companies I want to buy #EV’s but they need to be @UAW-made in the USA!,2020-01-27 19:10:56,Twitter Web App,0,3
How great to be with Mike Plater other @UAW Local 22 and @GM leaders as they announced that D-Ham will produce electric and autonomous vehicles that will hit the market as early as late next year - and be *the most technologically advanced GM plant* in the world. https://t.co/r4pUiUiGyv,2020-01-27 19:10:56,Twitter Web App,1,7
The president has blocked our House investigation at every turn. The news proves beyond a doubt that the Senate trial will be a sham unless senators call the witnesses who were present while the president’s scheme unfolded. #DefendOurDemocracy  https://t.co/qUnCu5wO82,2020-01-27 14:54:32,Twitter Web App,12,32
News that Bolton’s manuscript shows Trump specifically held up vital military aid to force a corrupt investigation by a foreign govt into U.S. citizens one of whom he considered his chief political rival in the upcoming election is explosive and unsurprising in equal measures.,2020-01-27 14:54:32,Twitter Web App,6,25
Much gratitude to quality journalists like @NPRKelly for reporting the unfiltered truth especially given the disrespect she was shown by the @StateDept in the fallout.   Her story: https://t.co/DrY348UycR,2020-01-26 00:04:47,Twitter for iPhone,0,16
I have news for Pompeo. The people of #MI09 care about Ukraine - a lot! Because that’s the homeland of many of us and important to our whole community. Plus all patriotic Americans need to care about Russia trampling a vulnerable ally.   https://t.co/pNVFTicYz3,2020-01-25 23:59:23,Twitter for iPhone,7,33
Can we please hit “pause” on this mob movie we’re all watching and get a real president already? https://t.co/VkLjbRAwXw,2020-01-24 23:14:48,Twitter for iPhone,5,15
Let’s fix the damn country!  @GovWhitmer and our great state are so deserving of the national spotlight.   https://t.co/9c5AleWRex,2020-01-24 21:03:16,Twitter for iPhone,6,34
This week I became a cosponsor of @RepJayapal’s H.J.Res.745 as part of my mission to fight for human rights worldwide. The #Kashmiri people deserve the same rights of freedom of association expression movement and religion as we all do.,2020-01-24 19:18:37,TweetDeck,242,633
Frontline activists indigenous and union leaders - that's exactly who we need on an environmental justice council. I’m really excited to see the change this group creates as we protect human rights good jobs our Great Lakes and our one precious earth. https://t.co/If5kfmzKlB,2020-01-23 21:07:54,Twitter Web App,4,10
Union membership levels are unconscionably low &amp; in decline despite the fact that Americans’ views on unions are super favorable &amp; unions lead to demonstrably higher wages &amp; better benefits. Clearly the system is broken.   The #PROAct can help fix it.   https://t.co/JcgSbQpSPb,2020-01-23 18:37:04,TweetDeck,17,60
To mark the anniversary of #RoevWade I recorded a video at the Macomb Women’s March last weekend. We must protect a person’s right to choose what they do with their own body. https://t.co/iAUDNIzUm5,2020-01-22 21:52:00,Twitter Web App,3,29
Ten years ago today the #CitizensUnited decision opened the floodgates to unlimited spending in our elections giving undue influence to a wealthy few. The House passed #HR1 to restore our democracy—now the Senate MUST act. #ForThePeople https://t.co/bXv0Ptz2dM,2020-01-21 18:59:06,TweetDeck,19,32
To me #MLKDay is an opportunity to recommit to doing the deep change work necessary to create a truly just society and to connect with so many people across Macomb and Oakland Counties working together on that journey. https://t.co/dQ3mNekDnS,2020-01-20 21:55:58,Twitter for iPhone,2,11
