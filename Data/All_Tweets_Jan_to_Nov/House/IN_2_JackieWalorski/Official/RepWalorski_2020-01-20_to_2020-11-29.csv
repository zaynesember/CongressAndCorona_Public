I’ve been working on a fresh approach to help working families thrive and I’m ready to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to find a better path toward our shared goal of expanding access to #PaidFamilyLeave. WATCH: https://t.co/vn75hCp3i3,2020-01-29 14:41:56,TweetDeck,1,4
I'm excited to partner with the Trump administration on pro-family pro-worker policies that strengthen communities across our country. Let’s build on our economic progress and find solutions that increase the availability of #PaidFamilyLeave for families. https://t.co/EC7klYPhri,2020-01-29 14:00:00,TweetDeck,4,10
Republicans and Democrats should work together to increase the availability of paid leave without reducing families’ economic independence or hurting small businesses. https://t.co/EC7klYPhri,2020-01-28 23:00:00,TweetDeck,0,5
Families have been the biggest winners in the Trump economy. But working parents shouldn’t have to choose between financial security and keeping their families strong. That’s why greater access to paid family leave is smart pro-family pro-growth policy. https://t.co/EC7klYPhri,2020-01-28 21:00:00,TweetDeck,1,1
