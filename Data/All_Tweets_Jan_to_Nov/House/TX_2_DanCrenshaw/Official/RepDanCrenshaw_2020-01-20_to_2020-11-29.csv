“Mr. Biden has pledged to return the U.S. to the Paris climate accord which would be a boon to China.”  Exactly. Joe Biden will give China exactly what they want: a free pass on pollution and a promise to not compete with them on our energy exports.  Bad deal. https://t.co/M0b5vDe474,2020-11-24 16:55:50,Twitter for iPhone,476,2685

Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden invited socialists into their party and now they’re surprised that socialism is at the heart of the Democrat platform.  Medicare for All. Green New Deal.

Say it with me: No more lockdowns.  The science and reasoning are clear that the extreme costs on livelihoods and the economy are not worth the minimal benefits.

Withdrawing troops rapidly might make some people feel better but it won’t be good for American security. We will be right back in the same place as pre-9/11.

The exodus from blue states (like CA) to red states (like TX) is quite simple: people and businesses want smart policies that work.

Small businesses are struggling to stay open. Unemployed Americans are wondering how they’re going to keep food on the table. Kids are falling behind while classrooms are closed.

Must watch: Democrats are not telling the truth. Pelosi believes that “nothing is better than something.” That is why small businesses aren’t getting relief. https://t.co/2uZfdhbyJ6,2020-10-07 23:24:33,Twitter for iPhone,1110,2560
Democrats have never “negotiated.” This phrase was always misleading. Truth is that Democrats simply refuse to allow a vote on the BIPARTISAN relief measures that could easily be signed into law.

We’ve been tracking shipments like this for a long time. We seize them when possible.

Bernie Sanders never proposes solutions to climate change. He uses virtue signaling &amp; fear to cloak a socialist takeover of the entire economy.

President Trump’s budget got a lot of criticism today from some Democrats who REFUSE to actually propose their own budget. This is hypocrisy at its finest.  What’s worse is the moral grandstanding and shaming that occurs every year with respect to spending. https://t.co/2pwFh9Z6SW,2020-02-13 00:15:07,Twitter for iPhone,10093,28456
Contrary to the popular doomsday narrative we continue to decrease emissions while we grow our economy. Natural gas has been the most effective tool to do so.   We can do even more by encouraging the right innovation. Read about the #NewEnergyFrontier 👇 https://t.co/gqqc55zXJM https://t.co/uHbfbE8qPz,2020-02-12 22:08:52,Twitter for iPhone,693,2979

The new peace plan is a good one. Here is why:  1. Based in reality not fiction and false promises.  2. 4 year freeze removes the “take it or leave it” pressure.  3.

THIS is our national debt &amp; the reason I introduced the End-of-Year Fiscal Responsibility Act.
