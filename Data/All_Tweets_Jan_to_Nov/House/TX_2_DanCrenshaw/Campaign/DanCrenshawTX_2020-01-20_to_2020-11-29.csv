Let’s debunk the myth of “failed negotiations.” The truth? Pelosi and House Dems believe “nothing is better than something.” There is plenty of COVID relief bills they could put on the floor for a vote that would get signed into law.

According to Joe Biden this is just “an idea.” An idea that hospitalizes cops destroys property and assaults and kills Americans.  Democrats cannot seem to condemn Antifa. It is mind blowing.

Biden also wants to raise taxes dramatically.  He bragged about $4T in new taxes then oddly claimed that’d lead to economic growth?

In many states universal mail-in ballots are sent to ALL people on voter rolls. If rolls are inaccurate and they almost always are ballots are sent to people and places they shouldn’t be.

Dems are lying.,2020-03-23 16:33:32,Twitter for iPhone,4001,8830
Dems are lying about the rescue bill. They say it’s a “slush fund.”   In reality loans to big businesses PROHIBIT increases in executive pay and stock buy backs. It’s in the bill clear as day.

Dems will make false claims about drug pricing this election. They’ll promote HR 3 which will destroy innovation &amp; reduce new cures with price controls.

Strange critique since the Speaker hasn’t proposed any additional funding out of the House.   Pure politics as usual.

Then why didn’t you vote “YES” for the Green New Deal when it came to the Senate Floor?  Maybe because it’s not a plan. Or a good deal. Or even “Green.” It’s a 3rd grade science project that isn’t based in science or engineering.

Democrats can’t win on substance so they’d rather mislead voters.  The bill they proposed wasn’t Medicare negotiation - it was price controls and would REDUCE new cures according to CBO.
