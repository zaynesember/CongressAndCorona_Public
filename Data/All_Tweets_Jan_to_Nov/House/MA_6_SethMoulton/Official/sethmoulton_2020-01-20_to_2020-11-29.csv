The President doesn’t care about the integrity of our elections or our democracy. He actively undermines it.   All he cares about is getting re-elected. And there’s nothing he won’t do to try to make that happen. This is an emergency. https://t.co/NYjZAuIwpj,2020-02-21 01:10:58,Twitter for iPhone,46,154

My biggest takeaway from the debate is that the issue of national security was conspicuously absent.

Lt. Colonel Vindman is a patriot and a profile in courage—the opposite of President Trump. Republicans who claim Trump “learned his lesson” were so naive.
