ICYMI: I joined @stinchfield1776 on @newsmax last night to discuss the Georgia recount and the importance of the Senate runoff election.

.@Perduesenate has a record of fighting for Georgians and we must reelect him to the U.S. Senate.   Jon Ossoff and Chuck Schumer want to: -Undo the Tax Cuts &amp; Jobs Act -Defund our police &amp; military -Enact socialized health care   We cannot let Democrats' radical agenda win. https://t.co/NhcKlJOaGn,2020-11-18 19:20:50,Twitter for iPhone,10,19
Proud to endorse ⁦@KLoeffler⁩- she is committed to conservative values and will fight for Georgia families &amp; small businesses.   Raphael Warnock is even more radical than Chuck Schumer. Georgians must reelect Kelly Loeffler and keep the Senate from taking a far-left turn. https://t.co/7BeSEzRc8x,2020-11-17 21:34:09,Twitter for iPhone,2,5
