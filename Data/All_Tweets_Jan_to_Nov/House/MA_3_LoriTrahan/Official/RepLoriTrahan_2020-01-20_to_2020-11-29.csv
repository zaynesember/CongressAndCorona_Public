It’s hardly a surprise that Donald Trump has chosen to finish his time in office the same way he started it:  Subverting the rule of law abusing the power of the presidency and rewarding his cronies after they’re caught breaking the law. https://t.co/DMKc9DJzuQ,2020-11-25 21:42:44,Twitter for iPhone,9,32

I’m old enough to remember when Steven Mnuchin wouldn’t agree to a relief deal until he got a $500 billion slush fund.

Cases are rising. Hospitalizations are rising. Deaths are rising.   Yet @SenateMajLdr and Republican Senators are willing to let #COVID19 benefits expire when families will need them most.   Calling this heartless would be an understatement. https://t.co/m9Kfc8qGKF,2020-11-22 18:39:30,Twitter for iPhone,6,26
Economists agree: Our job market will look completely different for the foreseeable future because of #COVID19.

Transparency is paramount during this pandemic &amp; the health care workers who show up each day along with the families of those still at the facility deserve to know that Life Care is doing everything they can to stop the spread of this virus &amp; prevent addt'l losses of life. 3/3,2020-04-11 23:52:29,Twitter Web App,1,6
Her urgent concern for her fellow nurses and the residents at the facility is a testament to her character and the values that she held.

Forcing voters to risk their health to make their voices heard at the ballot box is senseless.   Making #VoteByMail available to every American should not be a partisan issue.
