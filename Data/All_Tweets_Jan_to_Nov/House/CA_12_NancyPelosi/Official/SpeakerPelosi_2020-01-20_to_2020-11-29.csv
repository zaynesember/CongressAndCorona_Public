Amb. Bolton reportedly heard directly from Trump that aid for Ukraine was tied to political investigations.  The refusal of the Senate to call for him other relevant witnesses and documents is now even more indefensible.  The choice is clear: our Constitution or a cover-up. https://t.co/HBW82ObvOl,2020-01-27 00:14:53,Twitter for iPhone,24276,77906
