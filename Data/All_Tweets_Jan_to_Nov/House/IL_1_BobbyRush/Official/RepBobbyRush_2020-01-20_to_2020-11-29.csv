What a shameful moment for the U.S. Senate to have @RandPaul whitesplain what a lynching is to two of the only three black senators in the Senate.

The language of the Emmett Till Antilynching Act is IDENTICAL to the bill that was unanimously approved by the Senate.

This is saddening but not the least bit surprising.  As this article points out it doesn’t have to be this way. We must ensure our national testing &amp; contact tracing strategy does not overlook — or downright ignore — communities that have been hardest hit by this pandemic. https://t.co/anmBX0nGTk,2020-05-22 18:12:19,Twitter for iPhone,10,20

Ahmaud Arbery’s death was a lynching and my bill the Emmett Till Antilynching Act would have made it a federal crime.   Enough is enough. @senatemajldr it is time to outlaw lynching once and for all. Pass the bill! https://t.co/M2oR2tQtLq,2020-05-21 16:01:14,Twitter for iPhone,53,117

Absolutely. We must increase testing nationwide especially in communities of color &amp; other medically underserved areas.

@ElleLatham @AmDiabetesAssn Thanks for your question. A lot of bills contain this language in their bill titles and it simply means that not all of the information about the bill can fit into the title of the bill.

@MyreeATL Maybe but bill numbers are assigned in numeric order.  What's scarier is that black Americans are dying at much higher rates than other groups but are much less likely to get the testing they want/need. My bill addresses that. https://t.co/lRsDfSPl3A,2020-05-14 18:52:32,Twitter Web App,1,1
Thank you Jason.   The COVID-19 TRACE Act is about getting testing to the communities that need it most. As many scientists/experts have pointed out the only way we will get back to normal is by ramping up testing &amp; increasing our contact tracing efforts. My bill does both. https://t.co/FKDyaSMUeq,2020-05-14 18:45:44,Twitter for iPhone,1,8
The COVID-19 TRACE Act would not authorize removing #coronavirus patients from their homes or require testing.

Coronavirus does not discriminate but the U.S Healthcare System does. Tragically COVID-19 will illuminate yet another failure of this healthcare system: racial bias.

This is only going to get worse if we do not begin releasing nonviolent inmates from prison particularly elderly inmates which I called for last week.

This disproportionate statistic is particularly concerning given the increased risks to dialysis patients due to the coronavirus pandemic.

#DidYouKnow Although more people are using home dialysis today black patients are still less likely to use home dialysis than other racial and ethnic groups.

@EnergyCommerce Therefore when we discuss measures that the U.S. power sector should take in the face of record-breaking #wildfires safety and protections for our most vulnerable communities must remain at the forefront of that conversation. https://t.co/G5ezvrKe22,2020-01-28 17:39:06,Twitter Web App,1,3
@EnergyCommerce However I am admittedly concerned by reports of outages placing a strain on people with medical needs and disabilities.  Electricity is an essential service but extreme weather events will make measures like Public Safety Power Shut-offs inevitable. https://t.co/FaBuvyKUm1,2020-01-28 17:21:19,Twitter Web App,2,7
Last year California experienced historically catastrophic fires resulting in a tragic loss of life &amp; unimaginable destruction to homes &amp; properties.   The annual area burned in our nation’s western states alone could increase two to six times the current average by mid-century. https://t.co/2XwOjT09Y8,2020-01-28 16:36:53,Twitter Media Studio,4,13
We are underway at today's joint @EnergyCommerce Subcommittee hearing on the impact of #wildfires on the environment &amp; the U.S. power sector. As the #climatecrisis exacerbates these fires we must ensure that we are adequately prepared.

At 10:00 am (ET) I will Chair a joint @EnergyCommerce Subcommittee hearing assessing the environmental impacts of #wildfires and ensuring our energy infrastructure is prepared to address their growing severity.

"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it."  It is crucial that #WeRemember what happens when hate is left to fester. That is why this #HolocaustMemorialDay I will vote for the #NeverAgain Education Act which bolsters Holocaust education efforts in the U.S. https://t.co/XQE6mJDvXy,2020-01-27 21:59:05,Twitter Web App,3,11

This is absolutely outrageous but sadly not surprising. People &amp; communities of color are often left out of the #ClimateCrisis conversation despite being the first to feel the consequences—see Hazel Johnson.   @vanessa_vash we see you we  hear you. Please keep fighting. https://t.co/LYyFNjvkcB,2020-01-26 20:05:10,Twitter for iPhone,4,17

If you were actually serious about lowering the costs of prescription drugs you would tell @senatemajldr to take up bills like H.R. 3 and H.R. 987 both of which do just that and have already passed the House with bipartisan support.   But you won’t because you’re all talk. https://t.co/TaPsRYTeqj,2020-01-26 15:16:59,Twitter for iPhone,14,38

As the #ClimateCrisis exacerbates record breaking wildfires happening in California Australia and beyond we must ensure the federal government is prepared to respond and that our nation’s energy infrastructure is capable of meeting this growing and dangerous challenge. https://t.co/GAF4AphzVQ,2020-01-22 23:08:57,Twitter for iPhone,2,3
Two days after we celebrated the life of Martin Luther King Jr. AG Barr announced a Presidential Commission on Law Enforcement that includes ZERO community representation.

The work of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. has brought us far but we have not reached the Promise Land. As long as children live in poverty &amp; black bodies are preyed upon by our system of “justice” we cannot be free.  We must honor #MLK by continuing to fight these vast inequities. https://t.co/65v9ZBR2XS,2020-01-20 15:25:25,Twitter for iPhone,33,61
