Organizations like @humanrights1st report that the #RemainInMexico policy has led to 630+ cases of rape abduction &amp; assault as well as 130+ kidnappings. This cannot continue. #DontLookAway,2020-01-29 21:01:31,TweetDeck,12,21
I recently visited the U.S.-Mexico border where I saw firsthand the devastating effects of the Trump admin’s cruel #RemainInMexico policy. In the year since #MPP was implemented families have been forced to live in dangerous life-threatening squalor. https://t.co/aUrluzllFJ,2020-01-29 21:00:42,TweetDeck,25,59
This #USMCA agreement is a win for workers and businesses in NW Oregon and across our country. @HouseDemocrats will continue to find opportunities to strengthen our communities and fight #ForThePeople.,2020-01-29 20:25:03,TweetDeck,0,1
My work on the environment provisions resulted in critical improvements to the text and stronger rules monitoring enforcement and funding. Our environmental monitoring and enforcement efforts begin today at the time of signing.,2020-01-29 20:24:29,TweetDeck,1,4
We were able to remove many original harmful provisions including those that would have locked in high drug prices. The updated agreement is backed by many unions &amp; includes meaningful reforms to support workers in Mexico while also protecting US workers from further outsourcing,2020-01-29 20:24:08,TweetDeck,0,2
Our group had many meetings with USTR &amp; engaged in tough negotiations w/ the White House continually pressing for needed changes over a period of several months. The end result was an agreement with significant improvements that passed Congress w/ overwhelming bipartisan support,2020-01-29 20:22:37,TweetDeck,0,2
.@SpeakerPelosi created a nine-person working group to address these problems focusing on labor environment enforcement and drug pricing. Speaker Pelosi appointed me to the group to fight for improvements to the environmental provisions.,2020-01-29 20:21:10,TweetDeck,1,3
The #USMCA agreement as it was first presented to Congress by the Trump administration was flawed and included harmful provisions that would have locked in high drug prices failed to protect workers and the environment &amp; more. Trump’s version would not have passed Congress.,2020-01-29 20:20:25,TweetDeck,2,2
As the USMCA goes into effect I want to provide a look at how the deal came together.,2020-01-29 20:18:31,TweetDeck,1,1
The US signed the #USMCA agreement today giving workers and businesses the stability &amp; protections they need to succeed. This is the culmination of months of effort by @HouseDemocrats especially the work group I served on.,2020-01-29 20:18:10,TweetDeck,6,16
Cementing the status quo would further deteriorate any trust among the two parties and diminish the possibility of achieving a peaceful resolution that respects the rights of Palestinians and ensures the long-term security of a democratic Israel.,2020-01-29 02:49:18,TweetDeck,1,10
This is not a viable path to a two-state solution which must be negotiated between Israelis and Palestinians.,2020-01-29 02:48:06,TweetDeck,3,15
Today the President released a Middle East “peace plan” that was soon followed by an announcement that Israel plans to move forward unilaterally with annexing settlements in the West Bank.   https://t.co/xacrZ1VSQq,2020-01-29 02:47:45,TweetDeck,7,19
Restricting access to essential food assistance is cruel. @HouseDems are fighting #ForThePeople and opposing the Trump admin’s harmful rule which ignores the realities many families face in trying to provide for their loved ones. #HandsOffSNAP https://t.co/05g5RfwRvf,2020-01-28 20:40:39,TweetDeck,16,22
The Land and Water Conservation Fund is a bipartisan commitment to safeguarding precious outdoor areas across NW Oregon and the country. My colleagues and I are advocating for full and permanent funding for #LWCF to protect our wild places for generations to come. https://t.co/Fpfcnou4iz,2020-01-27 21:47:53,TweetDeck,5,17
I had the opportunity to speak with some of our neighbors who are working hard to gain their US citizenship.

The Senate must fulfill its Constitutional duty to hold a fair impeachment trial. John Bolton was a firsthand witness to Pres. Trump’s egregious actions which have put our national security at risk. There is an urgent need for his testimony. https://t.co/uESZl5nx60,2020-01-27 19:31:07,TweetDeck,12,69

The Honduran government should end its politically-motivated prosecution of Moisés Sánchez halt attacks on workers and allow union leaders like Moisés to freely organize without fear of reprisal. https://t.co/FEtwqTFxZN,2020-01-27 14:39:29,Twitter for iPhone,1,10
The suppression censorship &amp; manipulation of science has become the norm during the Trump Administration.

The compounded effects of institutional racism economic inequality &amp; environmental injustice are plaguing communities across the country including Portland. We must prioritize the needs of frontline communities as we address the #ClimateCrisis.   https://t.co/gX3P5cBlCn,2020-01-24 17:50:43,TweetDeck,4,12
We must expand #broadband internet access to the 20 million Americans who lack it largely in rural areas. This is an essential tool that people rely on to work learn and communicate. I’ll continue to advocate for an open internet including #NetNeutrality. https://t.co/yY7vWtgbe8,2020-01-23 21:49:18,Twitter for iPhone,8,23
Our ocean is becoming more acidic in the #ClimateCrisis harming our prized Dungeness crab in the PNW. The House passed my #COASTResearchAct to expand scientific research and monitoring of ocean acidification and support studies like this one from @NOAA. https://t.co/ZU0w6OBSlv,2020-01-23 19:34:36,TweetDeck,7,8
Our drinking water sources are threatened by the #ClimateCrisis but the @EPA is finalizing a rule to roll back safeguards for the wetlands &amp; streams that protect our access to clean &amp; safe drinking water.

Every January my OR staff and I volunteer at the @oregonfoodbank. Unfortunately hunger is a year-round problem in our communities where 1 out of 5 Oregonians face food insecurity. In Congress I’m working on multiple ways to address hunger. No one should go hungry in the US. https://t.co/kQAuCsF4mq,2020-01-22 22:07:40,Twitter for iPhone,3,18

It has been 47 years since #Roe but access to #ReproHealth is still under attack. 3 years ago the Trump admin imposed a #GlobalGagRule that forced NGOs to stop providing comprehensive reproductive health &amp; family planning services if they receive U.S. funding.,2020-01-22 21:27:09,TweetDeck,14,24

2/2 including many young children to live in dirty dangerous conditions. We must take on their fight as our own.

Dr. #MLK’s legacy challenges us to fight not just the battles in front of us but those that are hidden from us by the systems we are working to change.
