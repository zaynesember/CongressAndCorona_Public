My take for @FoxNews: @JoeBiden showed Tuesday that he’s for America and the diverse working families who are its backbone and its soul. @realDonaldTrump failed to show he’s for anything or anyone but himself. #PresidentialDebate2020 #Debates2020 https://t.co/YAgkWfY0NS,2020-09-30 04:16:15,Twitter Web App,364,1819

"Bad things happen in Philadelphia?" Please. @realDonaldTrump is encouraging his supporters to intimidate other voters at polling places and won't promise to leave if he's defeated. #PresidentialDebate2020 #Debates2020,2020-09-30 02:37:37,Twitter Web App,305,1215

Had enough? I just watched over half of my GOP colleagues vote to keep racist Confederate monuments in the Capitol. We can complain or we can vote them out. Help me get them the hell out — send $1 to help keep the House and win the Senate. https://t.co/gydvJcUZIt,2020-07-23 02:03:35,Twitter for iPhone,364,1047
We passed the Heroes Act two months ago to extend the unemployment benefits thru January &amp; also provide a 2nd bigger round of stimulus payments &amp; hazard pay for essential workers.

Congrats to the @Chiefs on the big victory. And congrats to the @49ers for finishing such a great season in style.,2020-02-03 03:11:14,Twitter for iPhone,114,1911
The fix is in. By refusing to hear from witnesses @SenateMajLdr &amp; @SenateGOP have made this trial a sham ensuring that @realDonaldTrump’s name can never be cleared. The stain of impeachment is indelible now.,2020-01-31 22:42:56,Twitter Web App,9145,32981
Trump’s lawyers tell Senate he can’t be impeached/removed over ignored subpoenas; House should’ve fought in court instead. Trump’s Justice Dept. lawyers tell court that House can't ask courts to enforce subpoenas. He thinks he's above the law. He's not. https://t.co/aaGPAkKHwn,2020-01-30 20:25:40,Twitter Web App,1569,5177

Yesterday I met with @ChrisEvans to talk about his civic engagement project #AStartingPoint. But I didn’t miss the chance to pitch him for his next blockbuster role. Check my insta story before it lapses for Chris’s answer. https://t.co/qwCLXoPRas,2020-01-29 18:27:25,Twitter for iPhone,23,151
If Twitter had existed back in 1974 Nixon still wouldn’t have sounded half as crazed and craven as this. https://t.co/Ade3s0Vd4F,2020-01-29 05:30:00,Twitter for iPhone,545,3873
He’s desperate. Keep calling: Senator Pat Toomey (202) 224-4254 Senator Rob Portman (202) 224-3353 Senator Mitt Romney (202) 224-5251 Senator Susan Collins (202) 224-2523 Senator Lisa Murkowski (202) 224-6665 Senator Lamar Alexander (202) 224-4944 https://t.co/Yaf2uucnJ7,2020-01-29 04:54:26,Twitter for iPhone,15776,34143
Three quarters of American voters know a trial without witnesses is nothing more than a cover-up.  More than half know Trump is lying (again).  Why can't @SenateGOP represent America instead of representing @realDonaldTrump? https://t.co/iT1dwn5oqB,2020-01-28 23:08:21,Twitter Web App,1127,4030
House managers presented an overwhelming irrefutable case that @realDonaldTrump abused his power for personal gain &amp; is a clear/present danger to our national security &amp; democracy.  Don't let his lawyers' evasions &amp; distractions fool you - this lawless president must be stopped.,2020-01-28 19:34:35,Twitter Web App,885,4309
This is happening on #HolocaustRemembranceDay; public charge rules were used to exclude tens of thousands of German Jews who were trying to flee Nazi oppression.   #NeverAgain isn't just a hashtag folks - it's a commitment. https://t.co/4PVVBA4rBm,2020-01-27 20:24:04,Twitter Web App,568,1415
Quid Pro Quo.  Refusal to call witnesses = aiding and abetting the cover-up plain and simple.  First thing tomorrow light up your Senators’ phones and don’t stop until we have justice. https://t.co/1JW8isUKDc,2020-01-27 01:49:03,Twitter for iPhone,4711,14683

The President’s lawyers didn’t contest that he solicited foreign interference in our elections to benefit himself personally &amp; politically. They’re trying to deflect distract from &amp; distort the truth. Today only made clear how vital witnesses &amp; documents are for a fair trial.,2020-01-26 03:47:57,Twitter for iPhone,4136,17521

This kind of abuse-of-power scheme is EXACTLY why the Founding Fathers designed impeachment. If we don't hold @realDonaldTrump to account we tell future Presidents &amp; all Americans that putting personal power over the national interest is OK. #TrumpImpeachmentTrial,2020-01-23 00:01:09,Twitter Web App,3009,12618
Each time the @SenateGOP votes today against subpoenaing witnesses &amp; documents each Senator is refusing to let Americans hear the whole truth. That's an insult to all of us. Remember this during the rest of this "trial." Remember this in November. #GOPCoverup #ImpeachmentTrial,2020-01-22 00:45:53,Twitter Web App,7968,24318
