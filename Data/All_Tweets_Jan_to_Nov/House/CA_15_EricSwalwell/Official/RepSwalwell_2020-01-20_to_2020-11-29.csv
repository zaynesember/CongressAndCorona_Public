It should go without saying that an offer of electoral help from a foreign actor– including dirt on an opponent– should be reported to the FBI.

We are making progress!   You don’t dispute:   ✅ Collusion evidence of Trump Tower mtg/Trump Tower Moscow   ✅ Hundreds of Trump witness refusals to answer questions   ✅ GOP controlled transcripts didn’t release them  ✅ You promised a Flynn tape still haven’t shown it https://t.co/BCASeRNcxM,2020-05-28 17:16:00,Twitter for iPhone,1338,4455
This is so comical. The Republicans led the Russia investigation which ended in March 2018. They chose to not release the transcripts. What on earth are you talking about? I’m worried about you.

Weaponize? History lesson: Democrats were in the minority for the Russia Investigation — it was a GOP-led investigation that allowed witnesses to not answer questions. And the Mueller investigation came from @realDonaldTrump’s appointees. So show us the Flynn tapes or buzz off. https://t.co/H4AzYhAolv,2020-05-28 15:48:11,Twitter for iPhone,9264,32812
The guy who spread “Russian propaganda” is the one who asked Russia to hack his opponent. It’s also the guy who said he believed Putin over the brave intelligence officers you betrayed.

This is uncomfortable to watch. Which is why you must watch it. I will defend any officer’s right to protect themselves in danger and “go home to their family” (as they often say).

.@senatemajldr may be the Majority Leader in the Senate but he does not have the final say.  The American people have made it clear that a trial without witnesses and without evidence is no trial at all.  We must all remain vigilant and vocal to prevent a sham acquittal. https://t.co/1fNhddwEIC,2020-01-28 16:16:29,Twitter Media Studio,5600,17032
Every second we spend attacking Trump’s lawyers is a second we aren’t reminding people about their client: the most corrupt president ever. Who cares about his insignificant lawyers? Trump is cheating and must be stopped. #impeachment,2020-01-28 02:52:00,Twitter for iPhone,16612,67199

Explain this to me b/c you disagree with how decisions were made on subpoenas you’re going to dismiss the case? Not dismissing b/c Trump is innocent but only to punish the prosecutors? Even when you can now hear from the witnesses you wished they’d call? That makes no sense. https://t.co/rn9gOTgRvU,2020-01-24 19:52:02,Twitter for iPhone,10997,39126

The case is overwhelming compelling &amp; incriminating. By refusing to allow witnesses or evidence – by keeping Americans from hearing the whole truth – the President and his enablers are making sure his name can never be cleared. #TrumpImpeachmentTrial,2020-01-22 20:54:36,Twitter Web App,7808,30086
