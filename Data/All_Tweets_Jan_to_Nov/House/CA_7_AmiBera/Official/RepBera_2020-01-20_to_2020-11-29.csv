We won’t defeat #COVID19 anywhere until we defeat it everywhere.  That's why I'm urging my colleagues in Congress to support a comprehensive global response to this pandemic.   The #CostOfInaction for our health economy and national security is too great. https://t.co/WT0bml17tF,2020-11-20 19:08:15,Twitter Web App,8,11

The President’s go-it-alone approach to this virus (and nearly everything else) is not only an abdication of U.S. global leadership it also puts our own health and security at risk.

A shortsighted decision by the Admin that will further hamper our ability to end this pandemic.

By withdrawing from the #WHO the President has further abdicated U.S global leadership.  His go-it-alone approach puts America's health and security at risk and allows other countries (China) to step in and write the rules.,2020-07-07 21:11:23,Twitter Web App,8,24
The U.S. has historically been the leader in #globalhealth. We led the fight against HIV/AIDS malaria and tuberculosis.

The Trump Administration even tried to cut funds to defeat Ebola...during an actual Ebola outbreak.  Is it any surprise that when a pandemic came to the U.S. the President was not prepared?,2020-07-07 20:47:53,Twitter Web App,4,9
The President has consistently downplayed the threat of #pandemics even before COVID. His Administration:  - Disbanded the National Security Council office responsible for preparing for outbreaks. - Proposed cuts to CDC &amp; DoD pandemic preparedness programs.,2020-07-07 20:44:26,Twitter Web App,5,13
It is this info and guidance from the #WHO that has helped countries in Europe &amp; Asia tackle and contain #COVID19.  They bent the curve but our cases are increasing.  Why has the U.S. been left behind while other countries return to normal? The answer starts at the White House.,2020-07-07 20:30:15,Twitter Web App,12,25
No response has been perfect including the WHO’s.   But the #WHO is playing a critical role by helping coordinate the global response to #COVID19 and providing important guidance and information about the virus.,2020-07-07 20:17:15,Twitter Web App,7,14
#COVID19 cases are surging across the U.S.  Instead of funding a national testing strategy and ramping up testing and contact tracing the President has chosen to cut testing and to shift the blame by withdrawing the U.S. from the World Health Organization.,2020-07-07 20:06:45,Twitter Web App,8,25
Another disastrous decision by the President that will leave American lives at risk.  We lost our best chance at defeating this virus once the President began to minimize the pandemic and shift blame onto others instead of assuming responsibility and actually leading. https://t.co/NfYSOtp5s7,2020-07-07 18:55:54,Twitter Web App,124,307

We're in the worst public health crisis of our time and the President is *still* hellbent on ripping health care away from 20 million Americans and rolling back protections for pre-existing conditions.

Today I kneeled and marched in solidarity with the #Sacramento community against police violence and racial injustice.  While we have a long path to go towards racial equality we can get there if we come together as one community. https://t.co/YlsPG15zc5,2020-06-03 20:21:10,Twitter for iPhone,12,53
We must also have comprehensive legislation to put a stop to police violence and racial injustice.  Yesterday I joined my colleagues in the @NewDemCoalition for a discussion with @TheBlackCaucus on the legislative path forward.,2020-06-03 17:05:13,Twitter Web App,1,8
As your representative in Congress I will continue to listen learn and advocate for policies that address police violence and racial inequities.  I look forward to working with all community leaders across Sacramento to learn how we can better advocate for sustained change.,2020-06-03 15:12:41,Twitter Web App,1,11
For many communities of color especially the African American community their reality is a discriminatory criminal justice system disparities in economic opportunity education and housing and a global pandemic that disproportionately impacts their health.,2020-06-03 14:16:44,Twitter Web App,0,7
George Floyd’s death has again brought to the forefront of the American conscience the systemic racism and inequities that members of the African American community face every day.,2020-06-03 01:55:14,Twitter for iPhone,1,12

Let's be very clear: tear gas and rubber bullets were used on peaceful protesters so Trump could get this video.  Was it worth it @realDonaldTrump? https://t.co/Yo3BjH2v5j,2020-06-02 13:46:25,Twitter Web App,8,47
It’s horrifying that rubber bullets and tear gas were used on peaceful protestors - all for a Trump photo op.  A disgusting new low even for this president. https://t.co/9WHkk7AFs5,2020-06-02 02:49:46,Twitter for iPhone,12,39

#RentisDue and millions of the lowest-income families can’t afford to pay.

President Trump is ceding American global leadership and handing it over on a golden platter to China.  His go-it-alone approach not only puts America's health and security at risk it allows others to step in and write the rules.,2020-05-29 20:26:42,Twitter Web App,5,20
The President's decision to pull out of the World Health Organization *during the middle of a global pandemic* is shameful and irresponsible.  WHO is not a perfect organization but leaving will make the United States and the world less safe. https://t.co/QYl58ZEO4F,2020-05-29 19:28:23,Twitter Web App,72,169

The people of #HongKong deserve freedom and democracy. We would be lucky to have them here in the United States.,2020-05-29 01:43:00,Twitter Web App,58,135
What will not change is the U.S. commitment to the people of #HongKong. The Trump Administration should demonstrate its support for those in Hong Kong who may now want to depart by granting visas to enter the United States and welcoming them.,2020-05-29 01:42:16,Twitter Web App,62,131
I strongly condemn Beijing’s latest assault on #HongKong’s autonomy and democracy.  I fear that the nature of the relationship between Hong Kong and the United States has been fundamentally changed for the worse. https://t.co/bWuplcry4K,2020-05-29 01:41:08,Twitter Web App,1363,1512

I joined my @HouseForeign colleagues in urging the Trump Admin to reverse the firing of @StateDept Inspector General Linick.

We're less safe when we act alone.  The President cut the U.S. out of the WHO ceding influence to China and gave Iran an opening by withdrawing from the nuclear deal.

The President is ceding American leadership on the world stage.

@EPA @HouseForeign It's unconscionable that the Trump Administration would propose a $3 billion cut in #globalhealth programs during the midst of the #coronavirus outbreak. #TrumpBudget 🤦‍♂️  https://t.co/CQlDHEDnzF,2020-02-11 19:46:59,Twitter Web App,5,12
@EPA The #TrumpBudget would slash #foreignaid by 21% weakening our national security and global leadership during a time of increased threats.   As a senior member of @HouseForeign I'll fight to ensure these dangerous and short-sighted cuts don't become law. https://t.co/FJSwzEhSvu,2020-02-11 18:43:47,Twitter Web App,5,13
@EPA The #TrumpBudget is bad for #SacramentoCounty and for our country. Instead of making our middle class stronger it will make it more difficult for hardworking Americans to get ahead. The entire family – children working parents and seniors – will be hit by this budget.,2020-02-11 18:22:08,Twitter Web App,7,14
A President’s budget is a reflection of their Administration's values and priorities.  The #TrumpBudget:  💊 Cuts $920 billion from Medicaid 🌎 Slashes @EPA funding by 26% 📚 Cuts $170 billion from student loan programs ❌ Cuts $24 billion from social security,2020-02-11 18:18:13,Twitter Web App,69,105
During #GunViolenceSurvivorsWeek I'm urging @senatemajldr to bring #HR8 the Bipartisan Background Checks Act to the floor for a vote.   Our country cannot wait any longer for commonsense reform. #EndGunViolence,2020-02-07 18:30:32,Twitter Web App,3,14
Many Americans today are working harder but for less pay.  That's why I just voted to help pass the #PROAct. We need to create an economy where everyone can succeed. https://t.co/DOvZeiBX49,2020-02-06 22:06:37,Twitter Web App,3,8

“We will always protect patients with preexisting conditions.” - @realDonaldTrump   In reality the President has continuously sought to undermine &amp; strip away protections for Americans with pre-existing conditions.  https://t.co/fuZEuvfN5F,2020-02-05 22:47:28,Twitter Web App,10,20
@HouseForeign The Trump Administration's expansion of the #GlobalGagRule undermines access to voluntary planning harms women's economic empowerment and restricts access to other health services like funding to combat HIV and malaria.,2020-02-05 18:22:36,Twitter Web App,4,12
Voluntary family planning works. You cannot empower women without ensuring they have access to family planning services.   My remarks at today's @HouseForeign hearing on the challenges women face in #globalhealth. https://t.co/LnV6FnMV4g,2020-02-05 18:12:10,Twitter Media Studio,17,54
#HR3 - the Lower Drug Costs Now Act.   The House passed this bill in December yet it sits in the Senate with no vote. Time for @senatemajldr to act. https://t.co/Gzn640GXXk,2020-02-05 15:31:40,Twitter Web App,12,19

@realDonaldTrump The president is leading a lawsuit to undue all of the  #AffordableCareAct. If the lawsuit is successful it will end pre-existing condition protections and strip coverage for millions of Americans.   We must fight to #ProtectOurCare.  https://t.co/ol0JVVcHVK,2020-02-04 22:34:12,Twitter Web App,3,4
@realDonaldTrump Drug prices have steadily increased under @realDonaldTrump. He promised to "negotiate like crazy" on drug pricing yet has nothing to show for it.  The President has opposed #HR3 the Lower Drug Costs Now Act which I voted to help pass out of the House in December.,2020-02-04 21:14:02,Twitter Web App,4,4
Since @realDonaldTrump took office our #healthcare system has been under constant attack. Premiums have risen coverage for individuals with pre-existing conditions has been jeopardized and American families continue to suffer. #StateOfHealthCare,2020-02-04 20:58:09,Twitter Web App,10,19

@HouseForeign I've also invited witnesses from the @CDCgov and @StateDept to update the subcommittee and public on measures they are taking to limit the spread of the #coronavirus internationally and to ensure the safety of Americans overseas who may be impacted by the outbreak.,2020-01-30 19:18:32,Twitter Web App,1,3
@HouseForeign I look forward to hearing from our expert witnesses on ways in which we can plan and respond to this virus. Congress needs to ensure the administration has the tools it needs to limit the #coronavirus outbreak. The health and safety of every American is our #1 priority.,2020-01-30 19:11:54,Twitter Web App,0,4
I'm chairing a @HouseForeign Subcommittee hearing next week on the #coronavirus. While the threat of the virus is relatively low in the United States at this time we must be vigilant and prepared. https://t.co/Q9yalqo04o,2020-01-30 19:09:11,Twitter Web App,7,5

@realDonaldTrump @RepZoeLofgren I'm glad to see the announcement that the House will soon vote on the #NoBanAct. This bill will overturn the President's #MuslimBan and prohibit future religious discrimination in our immigration system. https://t.co/ZUghi9CDiw,2020-01-27 21:22:07,Twitter Web App,2,9
