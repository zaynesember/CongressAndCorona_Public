They’ve put money behind this effort too: In 2018 @NSSGA spent $800000 lobbying Congress and the Trump Administration and gave $670000 to candidates who supported their anti-environment agenda. #tradeup,2020-09-10 20:06:15,Twitter Web App,1,5
One example is  @NSSGA. The environmental agenda on their website calls their members “responsible stewards of the environment” but all of their policy priorities call for rolling back environmental protections: https://t.co/7fp0AY2hNO,2020-09-10 20:06:15,Twitter Web App,1,4
