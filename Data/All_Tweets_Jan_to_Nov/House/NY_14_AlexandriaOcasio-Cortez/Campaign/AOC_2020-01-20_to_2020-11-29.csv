If you want to know why COVID relief is tied up in Congress one key reason is that Republicans are demanding legal immunity for corporations so they can expose their workers to COVID without repercussions.  Dems don’t want you to die for a check. That’s what we’re fighting over.,2020-11-24 19:44:49,Twitter for iPhone,60428,302314
@mcuban I don’t say this to point fingers but if we only say “shame on both” &amp; don’t actually drill down to see *what* is holding things up then it’s just performance  Right now GOP is demanding a full liability waiver for corps so they can expose workers to COVID w/o repercussion,2020-11-24 19:40:44,Twitter for iPhone,271,3294
@mcuban Pelosi compromised &amp; accepted the $4 trillion leveraged Wall St bailout the GOP demanded as a condition for passing the 1st stimulus check in CARES.  It was (&amp; is) a horrible deal that will structurally slant our economy against small biz for a long time. But she did accept it,2020-11-24 19:38:04,Twitter for iPhone,188,3070
@mcuban The fact that the Senate’s not passing IS the problem. They need to pass a bill so there’s a marker to negotiate w/.  Pelosi can pass 10 diff versions it doesn’t matter if the Sen passes nothing.  Thats why ppl don’t know what’s going on: Senate has 0. That’s on Senate leader.,2020-11-24 19:27:28,Twitter for iPhone,813,9170
@mcuban @tedcruz When McConnell actually brings the Senate into session and passes a bill then we can have a Senate version and a House version to reconcile and move forward.

@mcuban @tedcruz With respect @mcuban this is not a “both sides” situation. The Senate literally skipped town. They’re not even trying.  As much as it makes people feel good to say “a pox on both your houses” the fact of the matter is it’s a one-sided situation trying to escape accountability.,2020-11-24 19:03:04,Twitter for iPhone,1653,18175

The House doesn’t have filibusters @tedcruz.  We also passed several COVID relief packages to the Senate that not only include &gt;$500 billion but also prioritize helping real people as opposed to Wall St bailouts the GOP tries to pass off as “relief.”  Nice try though 👍🏽 https://t.co/X4YIdiXh5y,2020-11-23 22:28:22,Twitter for iPhone,16737,158005

This has all the conditions of a collective trauma incl PTSD risk for 1000s of workers.  Many of our hospital workers can barely speak about the trauma of 1st COVID spike.

I could say yes but who cares? Plenty of people without college degrees could run this country better than Trump ever has.

You can see how corrupt it is when you break down spending.

We have 100+ statues and portraits in the Capitol. Almost all of them are of white men.

Above all I keep hearing that booming voice of our forever Chairman Elijah Cummings.

One of the ways the GOP articulates their racism today is their idea that some citizens are “real” people and others aren’t.

Wow: Norma McCorvey (aka “Roe” of Roe v Wade) revealed on her deathbed that she was paid by right-wing operatives to flip her stance on reproductive rights.

First Instacart then Amazon now Whole Foods: workers are withholding their labor&amp; demanding dignity.

I understand disaffected voters because I once was one.  As a waitress I’d watch pundits on TV talk about how we didn’t need to improve the ACA much when almost no one I knew could afford insurance.

I know buying a mask might feel productive to some but if you don’t wash your hands WELL still touch your face etc it’s not doing much for you.

I worked my butt off to get elected against all odds without any special connections or money. I worked double shifts and wore through my shoes outspent 10:1 to get elected.

The Census is how funding for programs is determined.
