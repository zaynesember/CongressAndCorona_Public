And their answer to the rioting looting and lawlessness is to disarm and defund the police? As a retired 23-year police officer that's not the way of life we're fighting for. #OurWayofLife https://t.co/C9YyAa3C5Z,2020-08-27 01:35:00,Twitter Web App,2,6

Runaway spending is a barrier to our economic recovery. With our nation $27 trillion in the red there's never been a more urgent time to stop spending money we don’t have.

President Trump has appointed more than 200 judges to U.S. courts. We can’t afford to let Joe appoint the next Supreme Court justice!  https://t.co/4KM36sCvj0,2020-07-16 01:43:00,Twitter Web App,8,15
"Ballot harvesting which allows anybody to collect voters' ballots to turn into a polling location is especially susceptible to fraud &amp; sets a dangerous precedent.
