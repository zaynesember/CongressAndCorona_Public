Socialized medicine is the last thing we need. Medicare for All will lead to long wait times less health care choices and more TAXES.  We must support President @realDonaldTrump this November to ensure the Democrats’ socialist agenda is never implemented.,2020-02-26 01:27:50,Twitter Web App,1,2

All of the radical #DemDebate candidates on the stage aim to increase taxes and expand the already bloated federal government. This is not the answer. Our tax cuts work and we must do more to lower the tax burden on Americans.,2020-02-20 03:30:06,Twitter Web App,1,4

The radical #DemDebate candidates are too caught up in their socialist policies to realize that the American people don’t support socialized medicine. If they would be willing to reach across the aisle we could find a real solution to guarantee access to quality health care.,2020-02-20 02:25:35,Twitter Web App,13,68

House Republicans are fighting for a bill that would ensure children who are born alive during abortions receive medical care. The Democrats won’t allow a vote on it.

If the #DemDebate candidates would work w/ us instead of pushing socialist policies that Americans don’t want we could create a system to benefit the patient.
