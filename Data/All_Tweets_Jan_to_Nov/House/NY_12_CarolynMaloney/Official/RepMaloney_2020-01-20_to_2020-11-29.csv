We also need the ERA in order to give Congress the power to pass stronger federal regulations to protect women &amp; girls.  Section 2 of the ERA gives us just that!  With it we can get stronger protections against violence better equal pay laws more workplace protections etc.,2020-09-17 21:19:10,Twitter Web App,2,6
I have been fighting for the ERA since I first came to Congress in 1993 &amp; we need it now more than ever.  Women &amp; our basic human rights need protection in our courts &amp; we can’t always control who sits on the bench— but we CAN control what’s in the document they are interpreting. https://t.co/XohLMo37DO,2020-09-17 21:19:09,Twitter Web App,0,3
In Feb of this year my colleagues &amp; I in the House passed a bill to eliminate the original ERA ratification deadline leftover from the 1980s to make sure there is #NoDeadlineOnEquality &amp; all of these new state ratifications count.

The ERA was first introduced into Congress in 1923 &amp; finally passed in 1972.  We came *very close* to ratifying it in the 1980s but fell just 3 states short.  Luckily Nevada ratified it in 2017 Illinois in 2018 &amp; Virginia in 2020 🎉— after nearly a century we are almost there!,2020-09-17 21:19:08,Twitter Web App,0,2
The men who signed the U. S. Constitution on September 17 1787 in Philadelphia intentionally left many people out.  The largest group they omitted is women &amp; to this day women do not have full constitutional protections! The ERA would fix that foundational mistake.  #ERANow,2020-09-17 21:19:08,Twitter Web App,0,3
Today is #ConstitutionDay!  What’s that?  We in Congress created this holiday for all public schools &amp; federal agencies to educate Americans on our foundational document.

117 days after the House passed the #HeroesAct Trump and @SenateGOP still fail to grasp the gravity of the pandemic. Their “pause” on a #COVID19 response was a catastrophic mistake.

My full statement following the passage of #HJRes79! #ERANow https://t.co/qwoQBA7ofz,2020-02-13 18:15:44,Twitter Web App,13,26
#HJRes79 has just passed the House! I was so proud to have voted yes and show that there’s no deadline on equality.    Women are long past due equal treatment under the law &amp; we will persist until it is firmly guaranteed. With this vote we are now one step closer to an #ERANow! https://t.co/DTiwBdAw8M,2020-02-13 16:23:24,Twitter Web App,82,189
Thank you @SpeakerPelosi for your tireless pursuit of equality for all. It is thanks to your leadership that today we vote #ERAyes!  #ForThePeople #ERANow https://t.co/98zu6pW4tf,2020-02-13 15:56:26,Twitter Media Studio,39,161
I first introduced the Equal Rights Amendment (#ERA) 20+ years ago – and it’s as needed today as it was then.  Women’s equality WILL be spelled out in the Constitution.   And we will spell it E-R-A.   #ERANow   My full floor speech in support of #HJRes79: https://t.co/Z214ksJq5t,2020-02-13 15:25:06,Twitter Media Studio,390,1028
Proud we passed #paidleave so that parents like Sophia's mom don't have to choose btwn being home with their new child or a paycheck. 2.1M federal workers now have 12wks of paid leave for birth adoption or fostering. Thx to @BPC_Bipartisan for your partnership in this. https://t.co/wOiN1FKxc2,2020-02-12 23:57:20,Twitter for iPhone,13,24
Abortion:  ✅Internationally recognized human right  ✅Protected by the U.S. Constitution  ✅Upheld as a human right repeatedly by the U.S. Supreme Court  Congress MUST pass the Women’s Health Protection Act to ensure access to abortion care at the federal level. #ActForWomen https://t.co/zKR5BO845j,2020-02-12 21:25:06,Hootsuite Inc.,8,18
"The journey of this moment started for me with a walk around the National Mall...I found myself asking 'Where are the women?'"    The House finally passed my bill to create a #WomensHistoryMuseum! We must recognize women in order to empower them. https://t.co/2Ubzn2sXlv,2020-02-12 20:35:06,Hootsuite Inc.,15,30
One of @realDonaldTrump’s first acts in office was the unconstitutional discriminatory and morally reprehensible #MuslimBan. Our country was built upon the ideals of equality &amp; religious freedom and any attempt to ban people based on their religion is un-American. #NoBan https://t.co/FsOeudd920,2020-02-12 20:10:14,Twitter Web App,12,51
Great recap of today’s @OversightDems hearing with the director of the @USCensusBureau to examine the troubling risks facing the #2020Census ⬇️ https://t.co/f721JTsbiE,2020-02-12 19:50:25,Twitter Web App,5,4
Yesterday @OversightDems took a huge step towards granting basic democratic rights to the 700000 residents of DC. I’ve advocated for #DCStatehood since I first came to Congress &amp; I am so proud that we are closer than ever to making DC our 51st state!  https://t.co/euatAcqzbz,2020-02-12 18:45:07,Twitter Web App,17,34
If women's rights are in the Constitution they can’t be erased or rolled back by the political whims of legislators judges or occupants of the White House.  There's no deadline on equality &amp; I can't wait to take an historic vote tomorrow on #HJRes79 to say just that. #ERANow https://t.co/qeQby1gBWd,2020-02-12 17:30:01,Twitter Web App,41,85
You don't need to be an inventor scientist or Member of Congress to shape the future of your community- you just need to fill out your #2020Census form!    Make sure you are counted &amp; your community is represented. Visit https://t.co/ziTU4Vx9Vi for more information. https://t.co/2Pc0msnj6i,2020-02-12 14:00:00,Twitter Media Studio,3,6
.@Alyssa_Milano - I couldn't agree more. That's why the Senate needs to pass @RepZoeLofgren's Securing America's Federal Elections (SAFE) Act.  We passed this bill back in June and just today @SenateGOP blocked a vote on it. https://t.co/sKW2wbxs5y,2020-02-11 23:44:37,Twitter for iPhone,91,323
Transparency &amp; accountability in City contracts is important to building trust in local government. When I was Chair of the @NYCCouncil Contract Committee I passed leg to track City contracts &amp; vendors. I’m so glad the City is now making this data public. https://t.co/Om4jCcQU4w,2020-02-11 21:55:49,Twitter Web App,8,8
This is huge. We need a transit system that works well for EVERYONE including the millions of NYers with disabilities. If appointed I know Victor Calise will help the @MTA move forward &amp; critically expand subway accessibility.  https://t.co/lzZZKVEjKb,2020-02-11 21:35:04,Twitter Web App,7,17
I’ve always fought against efforts to privatize @NYCHA properties and this article tells you exactly why. The City needs to come up with other solutions to fix NYCHA’s chronic problems because clearly privatization is not the answer.  https://t.co/oReNbLnaEC,2020-02-11 21:10:11,Twitter Web App,5,6

"This is the epitome of bipartisanship here on floor of the House of Representatives today."  Thank you @RodneyDavis for your support of #HR1980 the Smithsonian #WomensHistoryMuseum Act. https://t.co/HK0OANzSwU,2020-02-11 20:03:30,Twitter Media Studio,2,8

My bill #HR1980 The Smithsonian #WomensHistoryMuseum Act has overwhelmingly passed in the House! Women have contributed so much to our nation’s history &amp; our stories need to be told. We must celebrate our achievements to inspire the next generation to make history themselves. https://t.co/DneInRynVR,2020-02-11 19:38:39,Twitter Web App,54,189
Today the House takes the 1st step to make sure our nation recognizes the incredible history of America's women.  We are part of every American moment but too often our contributions are erased.   Let's pass #HR1980 to create a Smithsonian #WomensHistoryMuseum! #InspiredByHer https://t.co/MjLE5dia5p,2020-02-11 18:38:54,Twitter Media Studio,14,40
This is disgusting. Using a position of authority to harass and assault women is unacceptable and there is absolutely no excuse for this behavior. This agent must held fully accountable &amp; punished for his actions.  https://t.co/hPb0iAXZWE,2020-02-10 21:35:04,Hootsuite Inc.,9,17
"You don't have a real trial -- you just have the appearance of a trial" Nash says. "A lot of the jurors in the South made their decision based on fear rather than the merits of the case. That's true now of some of these senators." https://t.co/XQZJj8Zcvc,2020-02-10 21:15:03,Twitter Web App,6,9

The government has undercounted female farmers for decades fueling an agriculture industry that has tailored itself almost exclusively toward men.”  It's time to put an end to this &amp; finally recognize women in farming for all of their hard work. https://t.co/J3vWaSVGfd,2020-02-10 19:36:00,Twitter for iPhone,3,9
Stephanie's death is heartbreaking. American Indian Alaska Native and Black women are much more likely to die from conditions related to pregnancy than white women.

Reckless driving has created a crisis in NYC and has resulted in far too many cyclist and pedestrian deaths.
