President Trump even on #VeteransDay was placing his own interests above those of the country possibly risking lives and our national security.

We're going to turn our Commonwealth blue this November. As someone who flipped a seat in 2018 I know what it takes. Had fun this morning speaking with my fellow PA women about our excitement for a Biden/Harris Administration. #BidenHarris2020 https://t.co/VdUzOUmL8M,2020-08-13 14:13:02,Twitter Web App,12,33

We cannot let this moment pass without acknowledging the historic nature of the first ever woman of color being chosen to serve as our party's Vice Presidential nominee. /5,2020-08-11 20:35:03,Twitter Web App,2,13
Having flipped a seat in 2018 I know that Pennsylvanians are looking for a ticket that will focus on the issues restore decency to the White House &amp; command respect across the world. A Biden/Harris ticket will generate excitement and turnout in our Commonwealth. /4,2020-08-11 20:35:02,Twitter Web App,2,12

Kamala Harris has a long &amp; proven track record of service.

I'm proud to serve alongside her in Congress. /2,2020-08-11 20:35:02,Twitter Web App,1,15
I chose to endorse Vice President Joe Biden early because I believe his vision for our country is one of unity and healing exactly what we need. That vision is made even stronger by the choice today of Kamala Harris to serve as his Vice Presidential nominee. /1,2020-08-11 20:35:02,Twitter Web App,11,98
I hate to sound like the annoyed and stressed-to-the-max mom I am but is anyone over there in the Oval Office willing to ever stand up and just say “Knock it off"?

The Republican Senate has failed the American people. We passed a bill 2 months ago to prevent this from happening. A crisis demands deliberate action from our nation’s elected officials.  https://t.co/qx8lzFtYyQ,2020-07-31 14:45:16,Twitter Web App,7,39

From the beginning I've made clear how crucial a national testing strategy is to beating this pandemic. Five months in and there is *still* no strategy from this Administration.
