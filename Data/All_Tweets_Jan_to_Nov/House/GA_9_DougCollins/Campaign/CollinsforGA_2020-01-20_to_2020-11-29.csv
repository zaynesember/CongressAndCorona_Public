I’m honored that President Trump would consider me but the Georgia Senate race is too important to trust to a squishy moderate like @kloeffler. https://t.co/oDMB9gzAhS,2020-02-21 17:07:23,Twitter for iPhone,39,105
If @kloeffler were the GOPs only choice we would lose this Senate seat. I can’t let that happen to this President and I can’t let that happen to Georgia. #gapol #gasen https://t.co/5rYBSxrkzF,2020-02-21 12:55:57,Twitter Web App,59,109
.@kloeffler is a very rich but very flawed candidate. She is so bad at this that her handlers won’t even let her do media interviews. So she’s running the Michael Bloomberg campaign.,2020-02-21 12:41:46,Twitter Web App,52,110
If Kelly Loeffler will buy a KIA just for show while trying to hide her purchase of a $24000000 “out-of-pocket” private jet you have to wonder what else she’s hiding.. https://t.co/u3CFMWf8V7,2020-02-21 01:50:41,Twitter Web App,104,201

To keep Georgia out of Democrat hands Republicans need a tested proven conservative candidate to unite around and that's me. We cannot leave this race to a fake conservative who has no record with Georgia voters. That's a recipe for disaster in November.,2020-02-21 00:36:28,Twitter for iPhone,17,62

I don't mind that Kelly Loeffler is rich and successful. Good for her.   But why try to hide your new private jet by chartering it under a company that specializes in giving its clients anonymity?   https://t.co/9TBnXuKTSA,2020-02-20 22:07:44,Twitter for iPhone,24,46

.@kloeffler stood with Mitt Romney in 2008 and 2012. In primaries and the general. But not a dime for @realDonaldTrump — not even against Hillary Clinton.  Loeffler’s big money talks: but it was silent for Donald Trump. #gapol https://t.co/RDdmNqat5c,2020-02-07 17:54:30,Twitter Web App,112,247

Republican voters in Georgia should choose their candidate — not one politician or a Super PAC in Washington.   The time for that contest is now so we can unite well before November.  Fighting ourselves and the left at the same time is a bad strategy. #gapol,2020-01-29 15:46:02,Twitter for iPhone,52,160
