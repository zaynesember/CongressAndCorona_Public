“He is a dictator. This must not stand” Chairman Jerry Nadler.   If it wasn’t clear before that this #ShamImpeachment was about nothing more than Democrats' pure dislike of @realDonaldTrump it certainly is now. https://t.co/u0O057pMl7,2020-01-25 00:00:16,Twitter Media Studio,6241,18572
Over a week ago the Senate passed legislation to extend the fentanyl ban but Chairman Nadler and Speaker Pelosi have been so consumed with impeachment they’ve failed to do their job.   While Democrats are playing politics the ban on a deadly drug hangs in the balance.,2020-01-24 21:33:21,Twitter for iPhone,4222,9294
Thanks to @realDonaldTrump the unemployment rate in Georgia has reached a new RECORD low! #gapol https://t.co/2tSarqx6Wi,2020-01-24 18:53:48,Twitter Web App,1538,4876
Senators are now seeing firsthand that this #ShamImpeachment has only been about smearing a president who’s done nothing wrong.    House Democrats have no case. https://t.co/9N4Q5fIX1W,2020-01-24 17:54:28,Twitter Media Studio,2521,7753

This proves what Republicans have been saying for years: There was no legal basis for spying on Carter Page during the 2016 election.   Congress must investigate the origins of this surveillance abuse and reform FISA to protect law abiding citizens. https://t.co/U0lauaZS8y,2020-01-23 23:48:56,Twitter for iPhone,5328,12059
Democrats had no case in the House so they delivered two of the weakest articles of impeachment to the Senate hoping they would do their job for them. #ShamImpeachment https://t.co/bYt8idU0sK,2020-01-23 21:14:49,Twitter Media Studio,2505,8294
The only reason Democrats are impeaching @realDonaldTrump is because they don’t trust the American people to choose their candidate in November.   Schiff even admitted it yesterday when he said “we cannot be assured that the vote will be fairly won.” https://t.co/PG6M3Q4xsp,2020-01-23 19:59:10,Twitter Media Studio,5511,15666
Democrats know they can’t win on the facts so they’re doing everything possible to undermine President @realDonaldTrump.   This is why you’re seeing what you’re seeing on the Senate floor. #ShamImpeachment https://t.co/QJEd4TlhE2,2020-01-23 16:44:32,Twitter Media Studio,2675,7457
Despite Democrats’ best attempts to distort the truth ahead of the 2020 election the central facts never change.    President @realDonaldTrump did nothing wrong. https://t.co/6W0erpzD5Q,2020-01-22 21:48:44,Twitter Media Studio,12492,39317
Chairman Schiff restricted Republican witnesses in the House.   Rules Committee Democrats claimed "plenty of witnesses were called."   Now Adam Schiff is calling for more?   House Democrats don’t get a do-over in the Senate. #ShamImpeachment,2020-01-22 19:49:50,Twitter Web App,17845,60066
To set the record straight during the Judiciary Committee process—the only time where @realDonaldTrump had any opportunity to question witnesses—@JudiciaryGOP was permitted:   0 fact witnesses  1 constitutional law scholar 1 staff member required under the Dems’ resolution https://t.co/WGBak3Xmab,2020-01-22 17:21:45,Twitter Media Studio,3087,6918
This headline was wrong in October 2019 and it’s wrong today.  Ukrainian soldiers didn’t perish in battle because the aid was temporarily on hold.  As David Hale testified during his deposition this was FUTURE aid.  Crow’s implication is misleading and wrong. #ShamImpeachment https://t.co/2RO0o1IXuF,2020-01-22 00:28:49,Twitter Media Studio,6383,13554
There is only one path that will uphold the Founders’ vision and safeguard the will of the American people: Reject the temptation of partisan impeachment and expeditiously acquit the president.  https://t.co/ZeAtTvs1fI,2020-01-21 20:56:12,Twitter Web App,3249,10153
If Chairman Nadler truly believes refusing to call new witnesses is evidence of engaging in a cover up why did he refuse to allow Republicans to call fact witnesses during the House’s investigation? #ShamImpeachment https://t.co/nUUbmHkCx4,2020-01-21 18:18:50,Twitter Media Studio,10940,26121
Since the day President Trump was elected House Democrats have sought to trigger the nuclear option by removing a duly-elected president from office an action never completed in U.S. history. https://t.co/zti9Ng8wZS,2020-01-21 15:15:26,Twitter Media Studio,2179,6167
The articles of impeachment before the Senate warrant not only acquittal of @realDonaldTrump but also the Senate’s absolute rejection of the dangerous precedent this #ShamImpeachment has set.

Honored to continue fighting on behalf of @realDonaldTrump.   This impeachment has been a sham since day one and we will continue to expose it for what it is: A blatantly political attempt to overturn the will of 63 million Americans. #ShamImpeachment https://t.co/ilVw3pcEWx,2020-01-21 01:59:44,Twitter for iPhone,3828,12081
This country wasn’t built on the idea that if you’re innocent you have to prove it.    If this is the new standard House Democrats have set we’re in for deep and troubling times in this country. #ShamImpeachment https://t.co/SjcBaUaWYM,2020-01-20 23:15:25,Twitter Media Studio,5397,14706

No @SenSchumer.   The president is not afraid of the truth because the truth—as we showed in the House—is on his side.  It's time to finish the trial and move on. #ShamImpeachment https://t.co/VmrBEBSStl,2020-01-20 02:57:06,Twitter Web App,5537,17991
