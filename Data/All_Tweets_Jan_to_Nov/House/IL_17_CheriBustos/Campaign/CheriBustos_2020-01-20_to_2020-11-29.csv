@TomPerez @CatherineForNV @dccc @dscc @DNC Here's the bottom line: When we expand access to the ballot it's good for democracy.  There's no place in our society for laws that make it harder for Americans to vote and our team at the @dccc will continue fighting to root out voter suppression wherever it exists.,2020-08-18 20:13:03,Twitter Web App,2,3
@TomPerez @dccc @CatherineForNV @dscc @DNC We have partnered with state parties across key battleground states including Arizona Florida Georgia Michigan North Carolina South Carolina and Texas. We must take on Republicans' decades-long voter suppression crusade.,2020-08-18 20:01:06,Twitter Web App,3,5
@dccc @CatherineForNV @TomPerez @dscc @DNC Finally community organizations should be permitted to help collect and deliver voted sealed ballots. We know communities trust their neighbors to collect and return valid ballots by the postmark deadline.,2020-08-18 19:52:40,Twitter Web App,2,3
@dccc @CatherineForNV @TomPerez @dscc @DNC Third signature matching laws need to be reformed to protect voters. For a ballot to be rejected three election officials must all agree that there is an issue with the signature and if that ballot is rejected the voter MUST be contacted and given time to correct the issue.,2020-08-18 19:52:16,Twitter Web App,2,4
@dccc @CatherineForNV @TomPerez @dscc @DNC First postage must be free or prepaid by the government. Second ballots postmarked on or before Election Day must count. Many states reject ballots received after Election Day even if postmarked on time. This is wrong &amp; unfair and it disproportionately hurts voters of color.,2020-08-18 19:50:23,Twitter Web App,6,5
@dccc @CatherineForNV @TomPerez @dscc @DNC The COVID-19 pandemic has created a dilemma for many Americans -- that's why we're fighting for four pillars of voting rights to protect us all as we vote in November.,2020-08-18 19:50:04,Twitter Web App,3,3
@TomPerez @dccc @dscc @CatherineForNV @DNC But reform can't end at registration -- casting your ballot shouldn't be difficult either.   Early voting should be expanded mobile voting sites that serve campuses and rural communities should be protected and voters should not have to wait for hours to make their voice heard.,2020-08-18 19:26:37,Twitter Web App,3,6
@TomPerez @dccc @dscc @CatherineForNV @DNC Several things could make voter registration easier: eliminating the requirement some states put in place to provide a full SSN to register no "wet signature" restriction and no more laws which disproportionately disenfranchise young rural or voters from communities of color.,2020-08-18 19:25:07,Twitter Web App,4,7
@dccc @dscc @CatherineForNV @DNC @TomPerez First thank you and welcome to my friends Chair Perez and Chairwoman Cortez Masto.

The President continues to divide our country rather than unite it. By sharing a racist video today he yet again shows his true character -- by not standing up to him to say it’s wrong Washington Republicans are doing the same thing.  Our country deserves better.,2020-06-28 17:43:26,Twitter for iPhone,36,84
I'm thrilled to have the Human Rights Campaign's endorsement this year! Thank you @HRC! I will continue working towards equality for all! Happy Pride Month and #UniteForEquality. https://t.co/vbwtbwhXHV,2020-06-28 16:28:00,Twitter Web App,5,14

I’ve listened to the people I represent in Northwestern and Central Illinois who are calling for real change in law enforcement practices and accountability. The Justice in Policing Act is the bold reform we need.  https://t.co/SzI0srNUJ3,2020-06-26 14:42:43,Twitter Web App,3,15
I'm proud that Illinois raised their minimum wage this year. Now it's time to make sure all Americans are making a living wage.,2020-06-25 20:45:16,Twitter Web App,3,5
The buying power of today’s minimum wage is diminishing year after year. In 1968 the buying power of the minimum wage was 31% higher than it is today. This is detrimental to our economy and the livelihoods of Americans.,2020-06-25 20:45:16,Twitter Web App,1,4
Last year I helped pass the Raise the Wage Act which would raise the minimum to $15 by 2025. This is a smart and measured approach to making sure over 30 million Americans earn a living wage.,2020-06-25 20:45:16,Twitter Web App,0,0
Today is the Anniversary of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. It’s an important reminder that there’s a critical need in this country to raise the federal minimum wage from $7.25 an hour.,2020-06-25 20:45:16,Twitter Web App,3,5

Washington Republicans have an obligation to condemn the president’s decision to slow down our nation’s response to this virus.  Saving lives should not be a partisan issue → COVID-19 has killed nearly 120000 Americans.,2020-06-23 22:14:20,Twitter Web App,10,16
Alex is a student at Bradley University so they know how important it is that young people are civically engaged. Among other things they are an active member of Bradley’s successful Speech Team.

President Trump admitted to slowing down our government’s response to COVID-19. Every day Washington Republicans are silent about Trump’s decision they recklessly put politics ahead of the health and safety of the constituents they swore to protect.,2020-06-23 14:23:59,Twitter Web App,2,4
By putting his personal politics over the health &amp; safety of the American people President Trump put innocent lives at risk. Washington Republicans must condemn the president’s remarks and his failed COVID-19 response.,2020-06-22 23:20:20,Twitter Web App,3,8
President Trump bragged about slowing down the COVID-19 testing we need to stop the spread of this pandemic and save lives. He did this because he feared the political consequences of Americans knowing how far the virus had spread across the United States under his watch.,2020-06-22 23:20:20,Twitter Web App,11,23
The last several months have presented some of the greatest challenges our nation has faced in generations. This moment requires us to do all we can to prevent Washington Republicans from succeeding in their effort to rip away Americans’ health care. #ProtectOurCare,2020-06-22 22:10:22,Twitter Web App,5,12

My Dad the late Gene Callahan would be my first call nearly every morning of my adult life. He would often end those calls with this: “I love you. I respect you.

Instead Secretary of State Raffensperger and Georgia Republicans have failed their constituents by refusing to provide Georgia counties with the resources and training they need to conduct this election.   This is not how our American democracy should look.,2020-06-09 21:14:23,Twitter Web App,20,40
