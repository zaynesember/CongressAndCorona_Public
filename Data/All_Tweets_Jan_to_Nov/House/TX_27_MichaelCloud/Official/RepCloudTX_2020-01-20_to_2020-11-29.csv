My questions to AG Barr: What are you doing to ensure the integrity of the voting &amp; counting process right now? Will you commit to using all resources at your disposal to ensure only legal votes are being counted &amp; being counted in a fully transparent manner immediately?,2020-11-06 21:48:36,Twitter Web App,190,438

My bill would create a bipartisan Sunset Commission. Each year the Commission would provide recommendations on whether agencies should be consolidated continued or abolished. Congress would take an up or down vote. (3/4),2020-10-14 13:57:23,Twitter Web App,3,6
One of the reasons Washington continues to mortgage the future of America is the massive size and scope of the federal gov't. Many programs are stood up to address an urgent issue but later outlive their usefulness. Others launch with the best of intentions but don't work. (2/4),2020-10-14 13:57:22,Twitter Web App,4,7
With the federal government nearly $27 trillion in debt with no plan on the horizon to ever pay it back I introduced the Federal Sunset Commission Act. This legislation would reign in some of Washington's uncontrolled spending. (1/4)  https://t.co/ZlCJMfn3qG,2020-10-14 13:57:22,Twitter Web App,6,15

60% of Americans object to taxpayer-funded abortions. Yet abortion providers like Planned Parenthood have access to billions in state Medicaid dollars — which the taxpayer reimburses at 90 percent for family planning services. This is a problem. (2/4),2020-09-23 18:08:35,Twitter Web App,2,6

I had the pleasure of hearing from representatives from Del Mar &amp; Wharton County Junior Colleges both of which are located in south Texas.  Community colleges provide flexibility for people looking to strengthen their education and help drive our state and national economy. https://t.co/p8JBgOQSY6,2020-02-14 18:58:25,Twitter Web App,4,5
Honored to be recognized by @SBAList for helping drive policies like removing hidden abortion surcharges &amp; ending federal funding for research that uses the body parts of aborted babies.  We’ve made progress but we must continue to support a culture of life in Congress. https://t.co/B2ja2cfTjD,2020-02-14 15:27:53,Twitter Web App,18,44
“In January the share of Americans aged 25 to 54 working or looking for work ticked up to 83.1% from 82.9% in December the highest rate since 2008.”  Conservative economic policies are placing more Americans in stable full-time jobs.

Great news for Texas and the entire country! @POTUS allotted $100 million in the FY21 budget for the channel improvement project at the Port of Corpus Christi.   @realDonaldTrump has shown strong leadership as he's strategically worked towards American energy dominance. https://t.co/nQdUc6amLC,2020-02-11 16:58:34,Twitter Web App,11,36

The partisan effort to impeach the president began long ago.   For months Washington has wasted American taxpayer dollars putting politics above the needs of the country. It’s past time for Congress to get things done for the American people so that we can move forward.,2020-02-05 22:11:44,Twitter Web App,746,3895

75 years since the liberation of Auschwitz.  Rosel and I were recently in Israel and visited Yad Vashem in Jerusalem. It was heartbreaking to walk among remnants of the Holocaust and moving to witness the effort to remember the names of those that evil tried to destroy. https://t.co/ofNYHJCkxR,2020-01-27 23:11:29,Twitter Web App,36,128
Every life has value. That’s why people across the country gathered today to be a voice for the voiceless. It’s essential that we protect the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness. https://t.co/8Jg98sE3D5,2020-01-24 22:12:22,Twitter Web App,284,1095
On January 22 1973 — in a historic moment of judicial overreach and without legislative action — 9 justices declared abortion a so-called “right" in the case of Roe v. Wade.  Since then 61 million babies have been robbed of the right to life liberty &amp; the pursuit of happiness https://t.co/BHbUK3SmrR,2020-01-22 15:07:06,Twitter Web App,86,166
