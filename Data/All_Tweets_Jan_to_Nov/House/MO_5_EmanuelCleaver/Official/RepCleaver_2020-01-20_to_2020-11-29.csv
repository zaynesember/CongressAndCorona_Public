This is why @RepJoeKennedy &amp; I requested information from the 25 universities with the largest endowments.

Studies show diverse-owned investment firms perform just as well as their counterparts yet they lack the same opportunities to grow.

The President has made it very clear that he wants #SCOTUS to strike down the entirety of the ACA taking health care from 20 million Americans. A vote to confirm this rushed nominee is a vote to do just that. #ProtectOurCare  https://t.co/A6MiHITmI2,2020-10-23 17:09:12,Twitter Web App,7,28
We are not rounding the corner of the #COVID19 crisis we’re walking straight into the next wave which could be a tsunami. We have to pass the #HeroesAct to provide the resources needed to crush this virus and protect American families and small businesses. The Senate must act! https://t.co/A8hbDf94MD,2020-10-23 15:30:12,Twitter Web App,9,32
Howard Porter Jr. is right. We should be past having to risk our lives to vote in 2020. Sadly #SCOTUS decision to gut the Voting Rights Act after 50 years and continued support for voter suppression laws leaves us no choice. #Vote https://t.co/dEV6gwOrHP,2020-10-22 20:22:27,Twitter Web App,8,16
With another 1.1 million Americans filing unemployment claims last week it marks 31 consecutive weeks with more jobless claims than the worst week of the Great Recession.

Mere days before an election in which millions of Americans have already voted the GOP is throwing principle and process aside to confirm an extreme #SCOTUS nominee they hope will strike down the ACA and kick millions off health care.

Failure to listen to the science and our public health experts is why we have 220000 Americans dead from #COVID19 with another 8 million infected.

I want to thank the Tri-Chambers for coming together to assist and promote the small businesses of Kansas City and I look forward to working with them in the months and years ahead!,2020-10-19 18:40:32,Twitter Web App,1,2
While Congress is working on technical fixes to the PPP to direct more lending to the businesses hit hardest we believe the Tri-Chambers can help small and micro businesses apply for business-saving loans now and once a relief package is passed.,2020-10-19 18:40:32,Twitter Web App,1,3
A lot of the reason for this is because minority- and women-owned business don’t have the same long-term relationships with banks and because some small and micro businesses don’t have the legal or financial expertise to apply for critical loans. https://t.co/STjP7PYwuU,2020-10-19 18:40:32,Twitter Web App,2,2
Over 90% of Black-owned small businesses that applied for PPP loans were denied leading to over 40% of black-owned small businesses being shuttered during #COVID19 pandemic. And it wasn’t much better for Hispanic- Asian- or women-owned small biz. https://t.co/JL9CUNpET8,2020-10-19 18:40:31,Twitter Web App,1,3

It’s critical to understand he has governed with the same principles (or lack thereof). He passed a $1.5 trillion tax cut where 83% of benefits went to the top 1%.

Americans are sick and tired of politicians working for the power rather than #ForThePeople.

Another 2.1 million Americans filed for unemployment this week. 1 in 4 workers have now filed claims in less than 3 months due to the Administration’s lackluster response to #COVID19.   Now more than ever we must pass the #HeroesAct https://t.co/Ne4HTVbbEb,2020-05-28 19:11:49,Twitter Web App,14,9
As businesses across the country begin to reopen it’s critical that American workers have the protections in place to ensure they aren’t being put in unnecessary danger.   Right now the Administration is failing in that regard. https://t.co/jWzLfWhfRn,2020-05-28 18:11:01,Twitter Web App,8,18
Chair of the Federal Elections Commission breaks down the fallacy of vote by mail fraud.

The bill has already been approved by both chambers of Congress &amp; is critical to ensuring nonprofit agencies employing blind and disabled individuals can maintain jobs for some of our most vulnerable workers.,2020-05-28 16:11:10,Twitter Web App,1,4
As economic crises arise workers w/ disabilities tend to be included in the first wave of workers laid off. We need to support these vulnerable individuals which is why I’m leading a bipartisan call for @RepMarkTakano’s H.R. 4920 to be included in the next #COVID19 relief bill. https://t.co/GQs9FdNdu1,2020-05-28 16:11:10,Twitter Web App,8,11

It makes no sense in the current climate for the government to slash jobs that are critical to our local economy and play an important role in our immigration and adoption processes. Congress has the ability to protect these workers and that’s what we need to do.,2020-05-27 19:27:22,Twitter Web App,2,19

There is not one single representative senator or mayor who doesn’t want to fully reopen ASAP but we need the infrastructure in place to limit the spread of #COVID19.

If we have a national testing strategy we can limit that spread and decrease the chances of a massive surge in cases and hospitalizations in the region. With nothing in place from the federal government we’re putting ourselves in unnecessary danger.,2020-05-26 18:09:10,Twitter Web App,0,3

Precisely.

Let us recommit to restoring voting rights for all Americans to ensure our government is always working #ForThePeople https://t.co/UsIuwzWzD2,2020-02-06 20:54:29,Twitter Media Studio,6,15

88% of voters want to reduce the influence of big campaign donors including 84% of Republicans and 92% of Democrats.  It’s time for @senatemajldr McConnell to start working #ForThePeople and hold a vote on #HR1!,2020-02-06 18:36:45,Twitter Web App,27,61
The influx of dark money following #CitizensUnited enabled the voices of corporations &amp; wealthy donors to drown out the opinions of the majority of Americans.   That’s why @HouseDemocrats passed #HR1 so that we could close the floodgates of corporate spending in our elections.,2020-02-06 18:36:45,Twitter Web App,28,70
If I only get bragging rights for one year you better believe I’m going to make the most of it my friend!  But I have a feeling we’re only getting started…. https://t.co/Ystq0Xo92r https://t.co/L2HlbTJSgX,2020-02-05 20:29:00,Twitter Web App,3,39

HA!  I’ll give you that one @RepJoeKennedy.  And I’ll make sure to give you some video of the parade today!  Or are the Patriots already filming it? https://t.co/VYAvKWGxOk,2020-02-05 16:22:40,Twitter Web App,34,242
We've been waiting 50 years for this Kansas City.  It's time to show the rest of America how a championship parade is done!  #ChiefsKingdom https://t.co/q27UXHrDTK,2020-02-05 16:10:16,Twitter Web App,10,58
There is no question that prescription drug costs are out of control. That’s why @HouseDemocrats have passed multiple bills that would #LowerDrugCosts.   All you have to do is tell the Grim Reaper to start legislating #ForThePeople,2020-02-05 02:47:23,Twitter for iPhone,32,79
When it comes to immigration policies all I can really say is the President should be ashamed and #DontLookAway https://t.co/CpbqbKEqP1,2020-02-05 02:47:06,Twitter for iPhone,58,106
To some Americans with pre-existing conditions the ACA has been a life-saving piece of legislation.   If the President is successful in striking down the ACA in the courts 130 MILLION Americans would lose protections for pre-existing conditions.,2020-02-05 02:43:44,Twitter for iPhone,13,23
Sadly the number and rate of uninsured has gone up under President Trump after years and years of the uninsured rate dropping since the Affordable Care Act was enacted in 2010. https://t.co/MotODmu8T1,2020-02-05 02:43:18,Twitter for iPhone,2,6
The President claims to be fighting to ensure every American has health care.   If that’s true why is his administration in court trying to invalidate the ACA?   Is he unaware that would actually kick 21 million Americans off health insurance? #SOTU  https://t.co/LUvHcJo7va,2020-02-05 02:42:55,Twitter for iPhone,12,30
The President promised that tariffs would bring lost manufacturing jobs back to America.   Sadly American manufacturing was in a 5-month recession thanks to Trump’s irrational trade policies. #FactsFirst #SOTU https://t.co/hzUpWmWltA,2020-02-05 02:28:26,Twitter for iPhone,13,23
Trump claims that tariffs have been effective.   If you call an 8-year high in U.S. farm bankruptcies “effective” then I would agree that the tariffs have been extremely effective. #FactsFirst #SOTU https://t.co/Io6e2hvX8w,2020-02-05 02:27:52,Twitter for iPhone,19,40
Speaking of Opportunity Zones.  A program designed to help low-income areas is instead benefiting the wealthiest Americans.   Among the early beneficiaries of the tax incentive are billionaire financiers — and Mr. Trump’s family members and advisers.  https://t.co/Nry5CdZSAd,2020-02-05 02:25:43,Twitter for iPhone,6,13
But that hasn’t stopped the #GOPTaxScam from exploding the deficit!   Trump’s policies have led to our deficit ballooning to over $1 trillion.   When Obama left office the deficit was  $585 billion. Remember when the GOP cared about deficits? #FactsFirst https://t.co/MFIadJddJY,2020-02-05 02:21:13,Twitter for iPhone,6,18
The President claims the #GOPTaxScam is the reason for our economic progress however the facts don’t back that up.  The whole point was to boost business investment that would spur economic growth.  The problem is business investment DECLINED the last 3 quarters.   #SOTU,2020-02-05 02:20:10,Twitter for iPhone,17,56
The President is absolutely correct that unemployment is at an all-time low and that’s great!   Since Twitter only allows 280 characters I’ll let this picture tell a thousand words on how we got here. #FactsFirst #SOTU https://t.co/C1LGbTk55k,2020-02-05 02:13:36,Twitter for iPhone,22,69
The President claims the economy is doing better than it’s ever done but job growth has actually slowed in Trump’s first 35 months when compared to the last 35 months of the Obama administration. #FactsFirst #SOTU https://t.co/Uu4XtBj9Iv,2020-02-05 02:12:14,Twitter for iPhone,44,65

It would be unconscionable and a complete dereliction of duty for the Senate to forbid John Bolton from testifying. The American people deserve the truth and a fair trial. That means the Senate must call for witnesses and documents! https://t.co/ekX5fYS7ae,2020-01-27 17:58:07,Twitter Web App,11,35

There is no foreign power that can bring our nation to its knees and they know that. Instead they’ve focused on fomenting division within the greatest democracy in the world so that we may destroy ourselves.   I pray that we don’t give in.,2020-01-24 19:07:17,Twitter Web App,8,24
However it isn’t just foreign adversaries who are flooding US media ecosystems with disinformation. Sadly much of this disinformation is able to spread like wildfire because Americans wield it for political or economic expediency. https://t.co/Jc53aLbMKh,2020-01-24 19:07:17,Twitter Web App,7,17
As the 2020 elections draw closer there is no doubt that our foreign adversaries are gearing up to meddle and sow further discord in our already deeply divided nation. This is something we expect and something we can defend against with #HR1 #SAFEAct &amp; #ShieldAct,2020-01-24 19:07:16,Twitter Web App,4,12

After giving a $1.5 trillion tax cut to billionaires and giant corporations President Trump wants to cut Medicare and Social Security.   Not on our watch. https://t.co/9IUuAgMHY0,2020-01-23 17:31:06,Twitter Web App,8,20
The President is dangerously ignorant of traumatic brain injuries. These are severe injuries with long-term consequences.
