@NancyBeigel @NancyBeigel the PPP initiative still has funding and the EIDL program reopened for loans for eligible businesses last night.,2020-06-16 20:17:45,Twitter Web App,0,0

The EO signed by @realDonaldTrump is not just insufficient it's an effort to paper over deep structural problems.  That's unacceptable.

For Puerto Rico this bill would provide $12 billion in direct assistance.11/12,2020-05-15 19:30:14,Twitter Web App,10,27
It provides badly needed fiscal relief for hard hit states and localities. New York State will receive $34 billion in fiscal relief and the City will receive $17 billion.  An important start. 10/12,2020-05-15 19:30:14,Twitter Web App,1,7
It also provides $10 billion in grants for #SmallBusinesses.  9/12,2020-05-15 19:30:13,Twitter Web App,0,6

#HomeIsHere for #Dreamers - where their families friends and lives are. That’s why I’m proud to support #DACA and the #DreamAndPromiseAct. We must #ProtectTheDream in Congress and at #SCOTUS. https://t.co/ebNBkwhGkR,2020-01-31 19:05:00,TweetDeck,12,24
There need to be witnesses.   Senate Republicans cannot be allowed to cover for Donald Trump.   They must do their constitutional duty and stop blocking a real fair trial.   https://t.co/vmgshmvALA,2020-01-31 17:48:24,Twitter Web App,26,62
I've introduced the "Blast Exposure Protection Act" a bill that would let veterans who were injured in previous conflicts from explosions but whose injuries manifest later in life receive care from the VA.

Today I voted for the #NoWarAgainstIran Act &amp; to repeal the #AUMF Against Iraq Resolution. This would prevent the President from taking military action against Iran.   #NoWarWithIran,2020-01-30 21:33:22,Twitter Web App,5,48
Jessica’s presence at Tuesday’s State of the Union will send a powerful message that we cannot abandon our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico and we must hold the Trump Administration responsible for recovery efforts for Maria AND the recent earthquakes.    https://t.co/xFp1X3VMSG,2020-01-30 18:21:04,Twitter Web App,18,35
Jaideliz's death has been attributed to the lack of adequate medical care on the Island of Vieques which has not had a functioning hospital since Hurricane Maria struck more than two years ago.,2020-01-30 18:21:04,Twitter Web App,16,33

Another example of why we must keep fighting to see the Dream and Promise Act enacted. I helped author this legislation which provides a path to citizenship for #Dreamers and #TPS recipients.    https://t.co/Cc7dSfmiRP,2020-01-30 15:55:42,Twitter Web App,19,29
Excited that @EPAregion2 has announced an administrative order that will begin full #Superfund cleanup of the upper third of the Gowanus Canal beginning in September 2020.

It’s a disgrace that the Trump Admin is treating migrants &amp; asylum seekers like this -  1 year of #RemainInMexico has proven dangerous and in some cases deadly. We must end this horrific policy. #DontLookAway https://t.co/RijDNKMDJx,2020-01-29 19:05:00,TweetDeck,39,59

I recently joined community advocates &amp; others to oppose @USOCC's plan to gut the #CommunityReinvestmentAct which would mean a return to redlining and deprive communities of needed capital.

Another act of hate this time in the #LES and on #HolocaustRemembranceDay.  I've authored legislation to provide more fed'l resources to combat crimes like these. In meantime our community will stand united in rejecting hate and prejudice in all forms. https://t.co/0eBsdJvPN4,2020-01-28 14:24:23,Twitter Web App,6,6
Trump Administration will be able to move forward with its hateful #PublicCharge rule intimidating immigrants from using safety net programs.

John Bolton’s testimony would go to the heart of the case against the President and he has made clear he is willing to speak under oath.

Another horrific hate-motivated attack in NYC. We must speak with one voice to condemn these acts.
