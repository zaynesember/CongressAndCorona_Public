If you’re confused by this- Twitter thinks Trump shot Adderall out of his nose.   PS I’m diagnosed w/ ADHD and have had a prescription for years so calm down guys I’m not snorting it.

So I did the one thing I knew Danny would have wanted me to do -- pick myself back up and write the book he thought was so important. I dedicate this book and this moment to my baby brother who I miss every single day and I wish was here with me to celebrate. Love you bro.,2020-08-11 13:36:40,Twitter for iPhone,14,628
There were many moments after my brother's death that I didn't think I would actually write the book. That returning to my life after my worst nightmare had happened seemed impossible. But I kept thinking back to our conversation and just how fragile life can be.,2020-08-11 13:36:21,Twitter for iPhone,8,343
We had a good night together. We were both raw but I felt hopeful. But the next morning I woke up and found him on the couch blue and not breathing. I did CPR on him as the paramedics came. He never woke up. The conversation about my book was the last we ever had.,2020-08-11 13:36:02,Twitter for iPhone,9,293
As I started writing my book I talked to my brother about it. We were home because our mom was in the hospital. My life had been upended. His too. We were scared for our mom. But in spite of it all Danny said the mission of the book was important &amp; he was glad I was writing it,2020-08-11 13:35:40,Twitter for iPhone,62,968

So don’t expect a test shut yourself in PLEASE don’t go to the hospital unless you ABSOLUTELY have to and let’s ride this thing out together. The end. (10/10),2020-03-16 20:38:45,Twitter for iPhone,278,2565
Now imagine how many people out there are like me and can’t get tested or who have the virus and are carrying it and infecting others and have no idea. Our numbers are way off and likely will be for the foreseeable future. (9/x),2020-03-16 20:37:08,Twitter for iPhone,202,1628
This is just me. One person. Don’t know how long I’ve been exposed if I actually have it how many people I’ve in turn exposed. Never will. Will never be in the official numbers unless it gets bad enough so hopefully not. (8/x),2020-03-16 20:35:40,Twitter for iPhone,125,1299
But ER’s around the country are warning about how they are already over capacity bc of the “worried well”. They don’t have tests (or nearly enough) in the ERs. If you go you’ll expose yourself transmit disease and take up room from others. Unless you absolutely have to. (7/x),2020-03-16 20:32:19,Twitter for iPhone,166,1235
I’m lucky. I’m young. I probably won’t get too sick &amp; I can hang out in my apartment for two weeks. But my doctor told me yes you almost certainly have it but nothing to do except quarantine myself &amp; if it gets worse like I literally CANNOT BREATHE go to the hospital.

Because my dad  ALSO still hasn’t been tested and thus is not confirmed. (5/x),2020-03-16 20:22:33,Twitter for iPhone,166,1265
So I followed the guidelines. I called the hotline answered the questions. Was told I needed to talk to a doc based on my symptoms got a phone appt with my primary physician and stayed home in the meantime. (4/x),2020-03-16 20:19:43,Twitter for iPhone,199,1719
I have had a dry cough shortness of breath &amp; a fever since Saturday. My dad found out Saturday afternoon that he’d spent a lot of time with a person who tested positive for COVID-19.

I was exposed to COVID-19. Here’s what happened.   TLDR: 1) we’re not testing enough ppl to know how big this thing is; 2) if you think you're in the clear you're not; 3) our healthcare system is about to be dangerously overloaded &amp; only we can save it so #StayTheFuckHome  (1/x),2020-03-16 20:09:29,Twitter for iPhone,4115,15737

Pay attention before you click that “buy now” button. Hand sanitizers Clorox wipes etc should not cost a small fortune nor are they guaranteeing anything.   There is no magic cure you can buy.  Wash. Your. Hands.   Don’t. Touch. Your. Face.   Don’t get sick or screwed over. https://t.co/CtRdKb6GIW,2020-03-02 20:14:12,Twitter for iPhone,45,256

I’m so grateful for the leadership @amyklobuchar has provided during her campaign but also as a Senator. She’s an incredible woman and she’s paved the way and inspired so many. ❤️,2020-03-02 18:53:59,Twitter for iPhone,89,1253
@NBSinDC She would be super effective. Just give her a megaphone and run her through airports.,2020-03-02 18:10:02,Twitter for iPhone,0,1
Y’all get to vote for these incredible women TOMORROW!!!   The only way to create real change is by changing who holds power. This can’t be about a single election or even a few of them. This has to be a movement that we’re in together for the long haul.   Good luck ladies. :) https://t.co/NrbDRuyCQz,2020-03-02 18:09:18,Twitter for iPhone,41,169
I know the corona virus is a big deal &amp; that the lack of test kits &amp; a meaningful federal response is awful but this video from the @CDC is most terrifying bc it means people have to be told things like “wash your hands” &amp; “don’t cough on people.” 😬  https://t.co/e7FuiTV29c,2020-03-02 17:43:50,Twitter for iPhone,19,129
The history @PeteButtigieg made during his campaign can not be overlooked. He showed that a millennial from the LGBTQ community deserves a spot in the highest tier of national politics and this will change the game forever. Thank you my friend.

If you want Trump out of office ask yourself this:  “What will I do if [name of least favorite/most horrifying candidate] wins the Dem nomination?”  The answer should be “vote Trump OUT then work hard to change the party from the bottom up so we are better &amp; stronger for it.”,2020-02-18 19:45:00,Twitter for iPhone,486,2716

No one is perfect. No candidate is perfect. But I like @AndrewYang and I hope he and his ideas and his supporters stick around and stay involved.

On stage at #MAKERSConference I just announced the next phase of my work: HER Time PAC!

Over and over again @realDonaldTrump will look people right in the eye make a promise then do the exact opposite. That’s some pathological sh*t... or just the simple behavior of a dictator. Nbd he’s just our president that’s all. https://t.co/2HIC2jYgmp,2020-02-11 05:27:13,Twitter for iPhone,319,1355

A reminder that paper ballots are the only safe way to go and proud as always that CA’s got it right.   But that also means we could (prob will) be waiting weeks before the final results for the most populated state in the country.

Nope. I’m saying a president can’t change all the things all on their own. But any of the Dems will be able to repair a lot of the damage Trump has done. And if we flip the Senate &amp; keep the House we can make progress w/ any of them. https://t.co/J8InaKJsDI,2020-02-09 00:11:09,Twitter for iPhone,64,625

I keep thinking about what I will say to those who are nervous/unhappy about the eventual nominee.   Too progressive? Don’t worry they can’t make stuff happen w/o the House &amp; Senate.   Too moderate? You need more progressives in Congress for stuff to happen anyway.   Just sayin.,2020-02-08 21:29:11,Twitter for iPhone,379,2474

Think of this: we wake up 11/4 with Trump re-elected still a minority in the senate &amp; maybe even having lost seats in the House.   Will we be ok with that outcome if it’s because we’ve been ripping ea/other apart instead of organizing?  And will it really matter who’s to blame?,2020-02-08 03:36:12,Twitter for iPhone,430,2525

Vindman was fired because he did the right thing but upset the president.

To those of you who seem to truly believe that everyone is out to get you &amp; your candidate: I’m truly sorry you feel that way. But I saw it from the inside- they just aren’t.

Again I was with @KamalaHarris &amp; haven’t picked anyone else yet. But when one candidate has huge #s of supporters who want to DESTROY the other candidates &amp; anyone who supports them the less likely that candidate is to get my vote. And the less likely we are to beat Trump IMHO.,2020-02-07 04:52:02,Twitter for iPhone,202,1776
Yes Iowa is a mess and &amp; we are nowhere near having a nominee but can we just take a sec to acknowledge this historic moment? Less than 5 yrs ago LGBTQ couples couldn’t even get married.

Yup I’m here. Here’s why:  A lot of people worked really hard so that I could represent them in the halls of power.   I may not be a Member of Congress anymore but as long as I have access and influence and a voice so do the people who put me here.

1) Iowa caucus-goers are not AT ALL reflective of Democrats in general &amp; caucuses are silly.    2) New apps are hard enough for me to learn &amp; I’m not a 70 y/o volunteer.  3) CA has 10x the delegates as IA.
