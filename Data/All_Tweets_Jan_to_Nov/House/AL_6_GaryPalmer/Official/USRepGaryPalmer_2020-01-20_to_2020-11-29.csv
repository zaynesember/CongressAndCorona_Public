Republicans want to work to help the American people. Pelosi has repeatedly blocked common sense legislation and instead tried to placate the most radical left. This has cost the Democrats many House seats. The choice ahead is simple—political games or common ground. #LetsWork https://t.co/1OqBadjsmV,2020-11-18 20:49:59,Twitter Web App,95,301

House Democrats are again trying to consolidate power and shield themselves from opposing ideas. Their vote-by-proxy scheme is already unconstitutional and rejects precedent.

Under the Trump Admin 500K+ manufacturing jobs have been added. Did you know 10K of those are in Alabama? Our state is also seeing booming business and record low unemployment.

Tonight I voted no on the #PROAct. If this bill is pro anything it's pro-union bosses not pro-American or pro-freedom.

At the end of President @realdonaldtrump’s fantastic #SOTU address last night Speaker Pelosi tore a copy of his speech in half. When asked why she replied “I was trying to find one page with truth on it. I couldn’t.”,2020-02-06 00:06:31,Twitter Web App,12,34

Needless to say these measures would endanger Americans. And by putting them into a bill originally designed to honor WWII vets Democrats have insulted the sacrifices they made to keep our country safe.  #HR550 #AUMF,2020-01-30 21:16:05,Twitter Web App,0,5
In doing this they stripped the @HouseGOP minority of its ability to debate and amend the bill. If enacted these amendments would tie the President's hands when it comes to defending our homeland from #Iran and its proxies in times of conflict.,2020-01-30 21:16:05,Twitter Web App,1,2
Today the House voted on #HR550. The full title of the bill is the Merchant Mariners of World War II Congressional Gold Medal Act. That might sound like a nice effort to honor WWII vets but Democrats gutted the bill and added amendments with grave consequences.,2020-01-30 21:16:05,Twitter Web App,1,3
Instead of deliberately debating constitutional war powers Democrats continue to play games at the expense of our veterans.   #HR550 #AUMF,2020-01-30 21:16:04,Twitter Web App,4,13
