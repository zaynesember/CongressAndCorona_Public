Always look on the bright side of life  For life is quite absurd And death's the final word. You must always face the curtain with a bow! Forget about your sin -- give the audience a grin Enjoy it it's the last chance anyhow!  https://t.co/x8VN9hu78D via @NYTimes,2020-01-22 14:55:33,Twitter for iPhone,120,487
I’m proud to support Cheryl Moss in today’s #specialelection for state representative for Greenwich’s 151st District. Even in 11 degree weather!  Polls are open until 8 pm don’t forget to go vote in this important local election. https://t.co/JFVmbeWGVx,2020-01-21 19:37:30,Twitter for iPad,20,61
This man corrodes our nation’s moral dignity one tweet at a time. Leadership used to be about leading us towards our better selves; towards sacrifice for others unity and grace.  This whining supernova of ego self-pity and mean-spiritedness is not America. https://t.co/JBVccBfrDm,2020-01-20 20:13:01,Twitter for iPad,287,1243
