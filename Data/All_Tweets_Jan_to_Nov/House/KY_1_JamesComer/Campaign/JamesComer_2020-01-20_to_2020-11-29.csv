My friend @Jim_Jordan is correct.  The FBI needs to provide an explanation on recent Michael Flynn revelations.  House Democrats used fraudulent intelligence throughout their entire witch hunt of @realDonaldTrump.   The FBI exists to investigate crimes not to create them! https://t.co/kzz2IjBrkO,2020-05-03 19:30:46,Twitter for iPhone,62,165

Questioned #PeterStrzok during a 9/17/18 Oversight Hearing about what he meant in a text about an “insurance policy” if Trump won...   After he arrogantly finished my questions I concluded with “This is a sad day for the FBI!”   Now we know this is the deep state at its worst. https://t.co/HnMDkbvpbm,2020-05-01 12:46:07,Twitter for iPhone,40,110

I completely agree with @GOPLeader. Congressional Democrats’ entire 2020 agenda has been to destroy @realDonaldTrump. No ideas to move America forward...just impeach embarrass obstruct. https://t.co/VEqQFAvVap,2020-04-29 23:43:33,Twitter for iPhone,76,162
There are so many things Congress should be working on NOW like moving essential supply chain items from China to USA solving the #COVID19 outbreaks at our food processing plants and providing credible oversight on record spending. @SpeakerPelosi should reopen Congress NOW!,2020-04-29 13:20:03,Twitter for iPhone,50,153

Spoke against Pelosi’s bill to create yet another committee to investigate Trump. I serve on the Oversight Committee. It’s made up of quality members from both sides of the aisle. Its role is to investigate &amp; hold government accountable to the taxpayers. No new bureaucracies! https://t.co/gv094Vg3ls,2020-04-23 16:02:25,Twitter for iPhone,35,124
Pelosi wants to create a new “Select Committee” w/subpoena powers to oversee Trump’s response to #COVID19. A better idea is to use the Oversight Cmte (COR) for that role. No need to duplicate services. However the COR will need to stop wasting time on impeachment &amp; DC statehood!,2020-04-22 18:37:09,Twitter for iPhone,31,84
I am opposed to remote voting &amp;/or proxy voting. Congress should vote in person just as it did during 9/11 &amp; the Civil War.
