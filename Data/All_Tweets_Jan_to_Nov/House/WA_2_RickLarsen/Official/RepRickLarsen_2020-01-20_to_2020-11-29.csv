Have you received your #COVID19 Economic Impact Payment yet?  If yes great! If not please check @IRSnews “Get My Payment” site at https://t.co/72t0uKprCF for payment status or to update your bank account info. https://t.co/RdcAejqOpX,2020-04-17 01:16:08,Twitter Web App,1,2
4/4 ➡️ For example if you normally get a $3000 refund when you file your taxes the Economic Impact Payment does not change that. You should still expect to get your normal $3000 refund when you file your taxes assuming nothing else changes even if you received an EIP.,2020-04-16 23:35:58,Twitter Web App,1,1
3/4 ➡️Because the EIP is a tax credit in addition to all existing credits &amp; deductions if it were claimed on your '20 tax return (filed in '21) you'd see a larger refund than you would otherwise have received. @IRSnews is simply sending taxpayers this extra amount (EIP) early.,2020-04-16 23:35:58,Twitter Web App,1,1
2/4 ➡️ Economic Impact Payments (EIP) are not subject to Federal income tax.  ➡️ Receiving the EIP does not take away from your typical refund next year (2020 tax return filed in 2021).,2020-04-16 23:35:58,Twitter Web App,0,2
