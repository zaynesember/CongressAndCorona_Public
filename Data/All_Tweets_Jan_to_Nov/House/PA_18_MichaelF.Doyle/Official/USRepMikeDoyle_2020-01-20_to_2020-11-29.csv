4/4 The steel industry was hit hard by #COVID19. @POTUS openly downplayed the #pandemic &amp; refused to carry out a federal response - and that increased steel job losses. @senatemajldr hurt steel workers too by rejecting @House-passed #COVID relief bills. https://t.co/7EfGIIVLCF,2020-10-01 18:02:13,Twitter Web App,4,3

@POTUS has tried to bias #census2020 from the beginning. @GOP doesn't want a fair count because it would hurt them politically. But his efforts to prevent an honest count would hurt millions of Americans and diminish the impact of their voices and votes.  https://t.co/JGOJf4hODj,2020-08-07 18:42:51,Twitter Web App,1,1
I’m outraged that @POTUS will end the #census2020 early with nearly four out of ten households still uncounted. The #pandemic is making it harder to reach people in many areas. The @uscensusbureau must extend its deadline as originally planned! https://t.co/w5q9r1x0Cd,2020-08-07 18:42:51,Twitter Web App,4,12

Congress must pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act to ensure every citizen can cast their ballot safely securely and without discrimination. #RestoreTheVote #GoodTrouble #ForThePeople https://t.co/Q2CEKlhLO3,2020-08-06 20:34:49,Twitter Web App,1,3
A 2013 court ruling made many key provisions of the #VotingRightsAct unenforceable. This effectively disenfranchised many Americans by allowing the purging of voting rolls closing of polling places and cuts in early voting. https://t.co/g26HBfhpNp,2020-08-06 20:34:48,Twitter Web App,1,2

#COVID19 isn’t going to just disappear soon. The only way to end this #pandemic is to tackle it head-on with testing treatment and vaccination. @SenateGOP should pass the #HeroesAct which would aid struggling Americans and add $75 billion for testing! https://t.co/FmPtiSUy12,2020-08-05 17:16:30,Twitter Web App,3,5

One reason the US is having more trouble than our counterparts containing #COVID19 is that @POTUS keeps contradicting/attacking our medical experts and promoting misinformation.

1/3 Let me get this straight. A former gun industry lobbyist got hired by the @WhiteHouse and was able to influence government policy to benefit his former employer.  https://t.co/KjnNKmna2R,2020-07-15 14:05:31,Twitter Web App,4,4
Great news! The @realDonaldTrump administration felt the pressure! https://t.co/USg3vQJoui,2020-07-14 23:41:17,Twitter Web App,6,47
I sent another letter to DHS opposing its rule targeting international students - which is just a politically motivated attempt by @POTUS to force colleges and students to reopen this fall despite the health threat posed by the #COVID19 pandemic.  https://t.co/Io6XDcsr69,2020-07-14 18:44:00,Twitter Web App,4,15
Due to the #COVID19 economic crisis millions of Americans will lose more than $2000 annually when they're eligible for #SocialSecurity. I’m a cosponsor of a bill that would prevent that - the Social Security COVID-19 Correction and Equity Act. https://t.co/fLhET4G1KN,2020-07-14 17:06:57,Twitter Web App,2,8
3/3 I'm also a cosponsor of HR 860 which would:  • expand Social Security retirement benefits for all current and future recipients • cut taxes for over 10 million seniors • keep Social Security solvent for the rest of the century https://t.co/MXG3LgsTkN,2020-07-14 15:04:20,Twitter Web App,1,2
2/3 HR 7499 would: • increase #socialsecurity benefits by 3% for the rest of 2020 • adjust some #socialsecurity benefits to ensure they lift all enrollees above the federal poverty level for the rest of 2020 • reduce the taxation of #socialsecurity benefits received in 2019,2020-07-14 15:04:19,Twitter Web App,0,2
1/3 Older Americans have been identified as one of the groups most vulnerable to COVID-19. Our seniors shouldn't have to worry about anything but staying safe during this pandemic. That's why I’ve cosponsored HR 7499. https://t.co/fLhET4G1KN,2020-07-14 15:04:19,Twitter Web App,1,2
4/4 The #HeroesAct also included $3 billion to help low-income households pay their water and energy bills $5.5 billion to help students and low-income households access broadband internet service and a moratorium on utility companies shutting off people’s water.,2020-07-13 22:30:38,Twitter Web App,2,8
3/4 That's another reason @senatemajldr should bring up and pass the #HeroesAct. @HouseDemocrats passed it weeks ago with $175 billion to help renters and homeowners cover utility mortgage and rent payments. It would also enact a new year-long moratorium on evictions!,2020-07-13 22:30:38,Twitter Web App,1,8
2/4 Our residents will also be eligible for help with utility payments. Unfortunately this isn’t the case for many other Americans around the country as the #Coronavirus forces states to walk back premature re-openings of their economies.  https://t.co/aTxU3ICHy9,2020-07-13 22:30:38,Twitter Web App,0,4
1/4 I'm pleased to see that @CityPGH &amp; @Allegheny_Co are offering help to homeowners and renters.

3/3 That's why the Senate should pass the #HeroesAct which would provide over $100 billion to support the education and safety efforts of American school districts and institutions of higher learning. https://t.co/BGeID3u7zo,2020-07-11 20:41:12,Twitter Web App,2,9
2/3 @POTUS points to other nations reopening their schools. The difference is that those countries have lowered their #COVID infection rates - and their governments have provided money to help schools institute new safety protocols to prevent its spread. https://t.co/LIOPKRjeV3,2020-07-11 20:41:12,Twitter Web App,4,11
1/3 @realdonaldtrump wants to reopen schools this fall but as usual offers no plan on how we can safely do it. Oddly he believes the federal government should play a minimal role in fighting #COVID19 - but can force states to reopen their schools. https://t.co/LXiP6HBERj,2020-07-11 20:41:11,Twitter Web App,5,11

Last month I joined other @HouseDemocrats in passing #HR7301 the Emergency Housing Protections and Relief Act. This bill would help keep struggling renters and homeowners in their homes and it would expand the eviction moratorium through March 2021. https://t.co/9n8qD8A4yW,2020-07-10 13:49:38,Twitter Web App,2,4
Over 30% of US households missed their housing payments this month. With the pandemic surging along with a recession with no end in sight now is not the time for millions to be evicted. https://t.co/Y9pbs1L0XW,2020-07-10 13:49:38,Twitter Web App,5,7
There are more effective ways to help Americans struggling to make ends meet in the #COVID19 pandemic than giveaways to corporations – which got a tax cut in 2017 and a bailout in March. Any more assistance should go to the cities small businesses and families who need it most.,2020-07-09 21:00:31,Twitter Web App,3,3
Big corporations don’t need more #COVID19 relief but many small businesses are struggling to stay afloat.
