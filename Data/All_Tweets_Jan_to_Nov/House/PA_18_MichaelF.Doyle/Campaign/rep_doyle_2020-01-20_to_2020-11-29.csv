.@realdonaldtrump looks like you still have no plan to address #COVID19 or provide healthcare to millions of Americans but one of your top priorities for 2021 is a multi-billion dollar spectrum giveaway to your GOP cronies... https://t.co/SnjY45gvV6,2020-10-23 21:00:16,Twitter for iPhone,0,5
The House passed the #HeroesAct in May to help struggling Americans during #COVID19.   @realDonaldTrump spent all summer on the golf course instead of negotiating a deal while working Americans weren’t able to make ends meet. #DebateTonight,2020-10-23 02:45:21,Twitter for iPhone,1,4
