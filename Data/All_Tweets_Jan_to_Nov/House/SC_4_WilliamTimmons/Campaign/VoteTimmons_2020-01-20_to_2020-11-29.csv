Mr. Cooper would rather insult the intelligence of SC’s voters than deal with this reality: in SC and across the country Democrat congressional candidates had a losing message.

Last quarter the GDP grew by 33.1% the fastest rate in recorded history. In just three months we have recovered 2/3 of the GDP lost due to COVID-19.
