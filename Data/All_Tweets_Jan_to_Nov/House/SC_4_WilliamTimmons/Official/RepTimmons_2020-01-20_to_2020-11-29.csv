@Genghis_Juan Hi Jack. There is no data which suggests we are “hurting.” The fundamentals of our economy remain strong. While business investment did slow in 2019 with USMCA and a preliminary deal with China now in place the business community is getting the stability it needs.,2020-02-04 20:08:15,Twitter for iPhone,0,2

We are not going to fix the debt immigration or healthcare in our country if we’re only working 57 days a year in Washington. Something has to change and the Congressional calendar and schedule is a great place to start. ⬇️  @ModernizeCmte https://t.co/0nkVYyvORI,2020-01-23 18:02:02,Twitter Media Studio,14,29

This statistic says a lot about the “objective nature” of impeachment so far. The House’s “process” was shockingly unfair and I look forward to @senatemajldr bringing this matter to a close. Congress should get back to work for the American people. https://t.co/IyWqIaNj4g,2020-01-21 20:37:35,Twitter Web App,15,19

With #MLKDay approaching last week I had the chance to visit his memorial in Washington. It gave me time to reflect on his message: freedom justice and opportunity for all. That message is as valuable today as it was in the 1950’s and 1960’s and I am proud to share it today. https://t.co/gMZXPflIfZ,2020-01-20 14:41:17,Twitter for iPhone,2,18
