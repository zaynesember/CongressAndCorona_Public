So proud of these amazing students! Loved watching you launch these ideas into action this morning.  You are why I felt so strongly about introducing passing and getting the Building Blocks of STEM Act signed into law.   Can’t wait for what’s next. #MI11 #NoviPride https://t.co/8cpZBxSZbJ,2020-02-03 16:11:29,Twitter for iPhone,8,74

It is an incredible honor to have Emily Parris Centennial Middle School teacher as my guest to the state of the union tomorrow. As long as I’m serving in Congress the needs of our students and educators will come first. #MI11 #SouthLyon  https://t.co/uadZDV2irK,2020-02-03 13:33:46,Twitter for iPhone,18,106

I just left a hearing about the maternal mortality crisis in this country. We have the highest maternal mortality rate in the developed world.   Instead of addressing real problems Trump is joining his top diplomat to attack and demean a reporter for doing her job. https://t.co/cC7STMaBN6,2020-01-28 19:23:15,Twitter for iPhone,134,542

47 years ago the Supreme Court affirmed the basic human rights of bodily autonomy privacy and access to healthcare in their #RoevWade decision. With women’s freedom under attack across our nation we must continue to unite in agreement that women have the right to choose.,2020-01-22 18:29:50,Twitter for iPhone,22,92
