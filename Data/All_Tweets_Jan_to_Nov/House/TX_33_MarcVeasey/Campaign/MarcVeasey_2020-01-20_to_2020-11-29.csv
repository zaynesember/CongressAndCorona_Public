Dan Patrick would rather sacrifice America’s grandparents than push Trump for common sense measures like invoking the Defense Production Act and declaring a National Emergency so laid off workers can quickly attain unemployment checks. https://t.co/cz5z362cSy,2020-03-24 15:36:57,Twitter for iPhone,5,5
Republican state leaders waited until last minute to shut down Texas Beaches. No telling how many people were harmed at Port A and Padre. And still won’t call for full lockdown to flatten the curve. But found time to deny women important medical rights. #misplacedpriorities https://t.co/0SJ2BxPOT7,2020-03-24 02:45:18,Twitter for iPhone,8,8

Texas Dems have a chance to change the face of national politics for decades. We are slated to gain up to 4 new congressional seats which means we'll hold nearly 10% of ALL seats in Congress. And we bring a lot of electoral votes with us too. Where TX goes the rest will follow. https://t.co/qMh35KrR14,2020-02-24 23:21:33,Twitter Web App,16,19

#AlanDershowitz your argument is w/o legal standing and insane! You are a total gloryhound that will do anything to be on cable Television.
