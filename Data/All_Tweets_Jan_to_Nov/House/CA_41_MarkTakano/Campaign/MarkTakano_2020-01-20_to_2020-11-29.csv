Let’s be clear about what happened last night: America rejected Trump and his politics of hateful division. When all the votes are counted Joe Biden will be president-elect. He will have won more votes than any president in history. We did it. Don’t despair. This is a victory.,2020-11-04 17:02:58,Twitter for iPhone,1,12
These homophobic tactics are not new. In the 90s I was subject to homophobic smears during my campaign.  I’m happy that society has changed so much since then. We’ve moved toward LGBTQ+ acceptance — it’s shameful to see the @GOP double down on hate.  We will not let bigotry win.,2020-08-26 00:39:45,Twitter for iPhone,2,11
The @NRCC wants its conservative allies to launch homophobic attacks against @GinaOrtizJones. They’re choosing bigotry over a debate of ideas.  But I have a news for them: Americans favor equality.  And in November Texans will elect Gina a proud LGBTQ+ veteran to Congress. https://t.co/BPHHFhe2UI,2020-08-26 00:39:45,Twitter for iPhone,5,6
“This is our moment to make hope and history rhyme” -@JoeBiden quoting Seamus Heaney tonight in his acceptance speech.   He’s right. This election is a battle for hope decency and the soul of our great nation. So let us make hope and history rhyme. #DemConvention,2020-08-21 03:40:25,Twitter for iPhone,3,8
It’s official! @JoeBiden is the Democratic nominee for President of the United States.  Onward to victory in November! https://t.co/yGba9ft4xm,2020-08-21 03:15:17,Twitter for iPhone,2,9

Congratulations to @KamalaHarris the Democratic nominee for Vice President of the United States.  This is a historic moment — for women Black Americans and Asian Americans. Representation matters and I'm proud that a fighter like Kamala Harris will be leading our country. 🇺🇸,2020-08-20 03:24:55,Twitter Web App,20,74

Well said @BarackObama. We cannot let cynicism get in the way of progress.  We have a moral duty to be optimistic — to do everything we can to make our country a more perfect union. That's only possible if we exercise our collective power and VOTE. #DNC2020,2020-08-20 02:44:03,Twitter Web App,2,7
The House voted to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act last year. Trump and Republicans are blocking it.  We need to elect @JoeBiden keep the House Democratic majority and flip the Senate to reauthorize #VAWA and strengthen its protections. Lives are at stake. #DNC2020,2020-08-20 02:11:08,Twitter for iPhone,67,146
Heart-wrenching.  Deporting the spouse of a military veteran and breaking up a family stands against all of our values. That's why I introduced legislation to give military spouses a pathway to citizenship.  This should NEVER happen in America. #DNC2020 https://t.co/KDofr4kyL0,2020-08-20 01:45:52,Twitter Web App,4,6
California has been lucky to have @KamalaHarris as our Senator. The country will be lucky to have her as our next Vice President.  Who's ready to hear her speak at the #DemConvention tonight? 🙋🏻‍♂️ https://t.co/Ouo8su32UC,2020-08-20 01:00:31,Twitter Web App,3,2

I'm so excited to be joining @HRC for a Unite for Equality panel they're hosting at 3pm PT today.  I will be sharing the screen with some incredible LGBTQ+ leaders and discussing the importance of representation at all levels of government.

As I told the DNC #AAPI Caucus my great uncle who fought in the 442nd and died during WW II believed in the promise of America. The progress we have made is proof that that promise is far from dead.  This is the most important election EVER. Let's get out and vote! #DNC2020,2020-08-19 18:39:09,Twitter for iPhone,0,0
Asian Americans are integral in the fight to create a more perfect union.  The historic selection of my senator @KamalaHarris as VP — the first #AAPI woman to be nominated — is proof that the work and activism of our community has not been in vain. https://t.co/9N80FQOeP7,2020-08-19 18:39:09,Twitter for iPhone,0,1
I went on @IssuesOn1 to talk about the progress @TheDemocrats have made toward equality and better representation in Congress.   On November 3rd we can elect more LGBTQ+ Representatives and @JoeBiden &amp; @KamalaHarris the most pro-equality ticket in history.   Let’s get to work! https://t.co/jIyGvhkTSp,2020-08-19 17:18:55,Twitter for iPhone,2,0
Like many of you I was left inspired after watching Day 2 of the @DemConvention.   It was especially heartening to see so many diverse voices deliver the keynote address including LGBTQ+ trailblazers from around the country.   Our party is the future. https://t.co/WqCsA9Tlre,2020-08-19 16:13:36,Twitter for iPhone,2,2
It’s true! And this November we can elect an even gayer Congress by supporting more LGBTQ+ candidates. 🏳️‍🌈  Give them a follow: @SDGeorgette @GinaOrtizJones @RitchieTorres @MondaireJones  @JonHoadley https://t.co/eOp3APgznw,2020-08-18 16:53:14,Twitter for iPhone,39,169
.@BernieSanders is right. This is the most important election of our lifetime. If Trump is re-elected the progress we have made will be in jeopardy.  We must unite behind #BidenHarris to build a better America. @JoeBiden’s policies will help move our country forward. #DNC2020,2020-08-18 02:45:34,Twitter for iPhone,6,13
The 2020 @DemConvention starts tomorrow! Get excited and commit to watch the #DemConvention 👇https://t.co/q73SugWQfP,2020-08-17 00:39:10,Twitter Web App,2,2

Understaffing and lack of PPE jeopardizes #PatientSafety and puts nurses’ lives at risk — especially during a pandemic.  I stand with @SEIU121RN nurses striking at Riverside Community Hospital demanding better working conditions more staff and access to the resources they need.,2020-06-26 22:11:24,Twitter for iPhone,8,20
Thank you @BernieSanders. You brought big and bold ideas to the race and we are better off because of it.  The fight to create a more perfect union continues. https://t.co/oJjpoA09qU,2020-04-08 15:49:14,Twitter for iPhone,2,12
Bernie cares about the future of our planet. He has listened to the young people who are urging our government to act.  We need BOLD solutions to tackle the climate crisis.  There is no time to waste. #DemDebate,2020-03-16 01:28:49,Twitter for iPhone,4,16
Very few Members of Congress stood up for marriage equality in the 90s —  @BernieSanders was one of them. He has displayed consistently courageous leadership in Congress and will do the same as president. #DemDebate,2020-03-16 01:00:02,Twitter for iPhone,6,12
.@BernieSanders is right. No person should be worrying about healthcare costs in the middle of this public health crisis. #DemDebate,2020-03-16 00:07:55,Twitter for iPhone,7,18
I’ve always admired @BernieSanders for the brave leadership he has displayed in Congress. I think he’s got the clearest history of protecting Medicare &amp; Social Security and I’ve seen him get things done for our veterans. That’s why he has my endorsement. https://t.co/yKXYzvzlUO,2020-03-10 18:02:18,Twitter for iPhone,1760,8388
