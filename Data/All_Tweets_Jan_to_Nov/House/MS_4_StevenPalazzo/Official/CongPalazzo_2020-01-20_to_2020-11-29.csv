The articles of impeachment have been dismissed and @realDonaldTrump was found NOT GUILTY.   From the beginning of this botched process we’ve known this was nothing more than a political exercise for Democrats. I am glad to see this partisan foolishness finally put to rest.,2020-02-05 22:15:22,Twitter for iPhone,9,34
The President has just been acquitted of both the sham articles of impeachment.   The articles of impeachment are the culmination of a three-year political witch hunt against @realDonaldTrump. It's time for our nation to move forward and for Congress to focus on the real issues. https://t.co/PQyEXHBPlc,2020-02-05 21:42:18,Twitter Web App,4,30
After months of wasted time &amp; taxpayer dollars we can finally close the books on this impeachment hoax.   Without regard to facts or evidence the Democrats rammed the articles of impeachment through the House in an unprecedented and shallow fashion.  Congress must move forward. https://t.co/l4ot0WpfEX,2020-02-05 18:55:05,Twitter Web App,464,2008

Dems' time to demand witnesses started several months ago when they came out of their bunker to push this partisan witch hunt into the public. As soon as Pelosi chose to send the articles to the Senate her time to call the shots and make demands ended.  #ImpeachmentTrialSham,2020-01-31 19:25:18,Twitter Web App,11,35
Dems had every single chance to conduct their investigation &amp; collect all of the evidence they see fit. For weeks they've shouted to the rooftops they have "overwhelming" and "indisputable" evidence.  Why demand more witnesses if you've done your job right?  #ImpeachmentSham,2020-01-31 19:24:23,Twitter Web App,521,2018

Democrats have wasted months focusing on impeachment instead of working for the American people and they have nothing to show for it. They have no facts and no evidence.

In 9 days the ban expires. The Senate has already acted unanimously to extend the ban of fentanyl.  America has an #OpioidCrisis and we can't afford for this ban to expire.

Fentanyl is a deadly opioid that has taken thousands of lives - the federal ban on fentanyl expires in just 9 days.
