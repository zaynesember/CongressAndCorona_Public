Appreciate the support of @jdanbishop @buddforcongress and numerous others advocating for employees and business owners in both South and North Carolina who DESPERATELY need the economic boost the RNC Convention would bring in August.  https://t.co/wSbz5M6r3C https://t.co/zu1vTQhREz,2020-06-03 01:44:29,Twitter Web App,1,5
My deepest condolences to Mr. Brown and his entire family. This is absolutely heartbreaking. https://t.co/4DnExlvikh,2020-04-24 13:27:42,Twitter for iPhone,1,6
What an incredible evening! Over 1000 supporters packed a sold-out venue last night to help kick off my 2020 campaign. @NikkiHaley was amazing and I'm so grateful for her support.  To everyone who attended and hundreds of other who couldn't but sent their best wishes thank you! https://t.co/lqTUleQmWt,2020-03-03 17:41:02,Twitter Web App,17,229
We oversold our original location at Winthrop University.  And early this morning we reach capacity and SOLD OUT of the larger venue.  Honored to have such an overwhelming show of support for my campaign and can't wait to see many of you this evening! https://t.co/acAIkEpN6X,2020-03-02 15:25:28,Twitter Web App,12,54
We oversold our first venue had to move to a larger facility and now that’s almost full! Major excitement for my campaign kickoff on Monday March 2nd with special guest @NikkiHaley! https://t.co/X9de5OR6ph,2020-02-23 16:16:40,Twitter for iPhone,2,11
She sure will.  Anyone remotely aligned with @NikkiHaley's values wouldn't be running as a liberal Democrat. And any Democrat being honest with voters wouldn't be using her image to imply a quasi-endorsement.  #SC05 will see this for what it is: shameless &amp; ill-advised. https://t.co/BNiNWxmzCe,2020-02-04 20:34:02,Twitter Web App,6,14
