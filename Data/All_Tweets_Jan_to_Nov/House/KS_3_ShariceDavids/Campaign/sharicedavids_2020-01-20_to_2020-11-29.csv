You have a very clear choice in this election.   Between someone who embraces Donald Trump and his brand of politics - and someone who knows that we can do better.   Between someone who championed the Brownback tax experiment - and someone who fought against it. #KS03,2020-10-22 23:29:26,Twitter Web App,69,363
Too many Kansas families struggle with the price of healthcare and that’s why I’ve fought to bring down the costs including prescription drugs and premiums and to protect people with pre-existing conditions. #KS03 https://t.co/Sqv5PPiKLx,2020-10-22 23:21:09,Twitter Web App,12,73
So many families are feeling the anxiety of not knowing how they will be able to pay their bills or put food on the table for their families.

Our country is going through a difficult and long overdue conversation about racial inequality.

We need more opportunities for everyone in our community. That starts with quality public education. We have to invest in public schools in early childhood education. We also need to make sure that everyone has access to affordable quality health care. #KS03,2020-10-22 22:46:29,Twitter Web App,15,133
My opponent has a different view. She was a campaign manager and top advisor for former Governor Sam Brownback.   She worked hard to pass Brownback’s tax plans and cuts to our schools. She even said that he was an “incredible governor.” I disagree. #KS03,2020-10-22 22:36:55,Twitter Web App,32,207
I was raised by a single mom Army Veteran. I started out at Johnson County Community College.  Every opportunity I’ve had in my life has stemmed from the fact that I had a good public education.

In the short term we must increase testing support Community Health Centers &amp; expand access to health care. https://t.co/AjGMMMe3rs,2020-09-25 17:18:57,Twitter Web App,12,31
A3: In this Congress we've passed dozens of bills to expand access to health care &amp; lower costs. I also championed legislation that would help KS finally expand Medicaid.    Sadly these bills still sit on Mitch McConnell's desk - another reason we must flip the Senate! #ELCare https://t.co/qrMHzgjTJ4,2020-09-25 17:17:09,Twitter Web App,25,75
Q2: Health care was the No. 1 issue I heard about on the campaign trail in 2018  — and it’s one reason I beat a four-term Republican incumbent (who repeatedly voted to repeal the ACA) to represent #KS03 in Congress. #ELCare https://t.co/8mAfdSvH18,2020-09-25 17:09:13,Twitter Web App,14,41
A1: When I was starting out &amp; buried in student loan debt health insurance wasn't a priority.

Too many of us have felt this same pain. #ELcare https://t.co/VjKdIMCJyr,2020-09-25 17:06:16,Twitter Web App,25,128

One year ago today we passed universal background check legislation with bipartisan support.   Mitch McConnell refuses to bring this bill to a vote — once again putting special interests like the gun lobby ahead of the safety of our children &amp; families.  https://t.co/9JnZzMSM8A,2020-02-27 23:50:43,Twitter Web App,94,281

My heart is with the Parkland community on this difficult day and with all those whose lives have been affected by the gun violence epidemic in this country. We can and must do better. #EndGunViolenceNow #MSDStrong https://t.co/6fb6Kc6qdQ,2020-02-14 19:08:28,Twitter Web App,31,125
The average person in this country sees nine prescription drug ads every day. But they leave out a key piece of information: the price.   That's why I introduced a bill requiring drug companies to disclose their prices in ads so they're held accountable. https://t.co/5NroLAaSXk,2020-02-14 15:57:41,Twitter Web App,126,657
My heart breaks for these families. No one should go broke trying to take care of themselves or their loved ones — let alone go to jail for it. I'll keep working to lower health care costs &amp; protect people with pre-existing conditions.  https://t.co/MxlZ5jEDSU,2020-02-11 20:44:36,Twitter Web App,278,957

Kansas: we've got a fight on our hands. Tomorrow the Kansas House will vote on a constitutional amendment that could allow for a complete ban on abortion with no exceptions.

“It came to the point where I didn’t expect to get help...I kind of lost faith but thanks to this office right here I’m starting to pull myself up.”  Stories like Kyle's are exactly why I ran for office in the first place and why I'm so proud of my team.https://t.co/ZnmocHYYSt,2020-02-06 15:16:05,Twitter Web App,14,82

My office has focused on serving &amp; listening to people in all corners of #KS03. It's how we met Kyle a veteran from Overland Park and helped him finally receive his Purple Heart seven years after he was injured in Afghanistan. Tonight I'm excited to host him as my #SOTU guest. https://t.co/0uRz3fxZsn,2020-02-05 01:44:33,Twitter Media Studio,118,562

Women deserve the right to make their own health care decisions period. This amendment would set the stage for potentionally devastating attacks on reproductive care in Kansas.   I hope you’ll join me in calling on the #ksleg to oppose this proposal. https://t.co/efmsgIASrx,2020-01-30 18:53:49,Twitter for iPhone,66,275
Since being admitted to the Union in 1861 as a free state Kansas has always lived up to its motto: Ad Astra per Aspera (to the stars through difficulties).   Happy #KansasDay! 159 never looked so good. 🌻,2020-01-29 15:15:57,Twitter for iPhone,87,519
I'm a proud product of Kansas public schools - it's why I was able to work my way from community college to law school to the White House as a fellow.

Reproductive care is health care and medical decisions should stay between patients and their doctors – always. But that right is under attack every day.

Ten years ago the Supreme Court decided that money equals speech in the devastating #CitizensUnited case. I'm here to say that:  ➡️Money is not speech. ➡️Corporations are not people. ➡️Our democracy is not for sale. https://t.co/zA2xqgsUpT,2020-01-21 16:15:51,Twitter Media Studio,185,682
