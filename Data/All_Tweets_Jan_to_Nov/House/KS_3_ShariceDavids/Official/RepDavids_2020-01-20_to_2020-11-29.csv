For far too long Native voices have been underrepresented in Congress. Issues important to tribal communities have often been minimized or ignored.   That’s why I’m glad to join @TransportDems this morning for a hearing on tribal infrastructure. Tune in:  https://t.co/nxEOs061dE,2020-02-06 14:53:41,Twitter for iPhone,43,193
