Wonder if decision desks are more cautious because they know Trump is litigious and may sue. Given what we know and the assessments from @Redistrict and @NateSilver538 I feel comfortable with the race being called. https://t.co/wOFsxqWsLU,2020-11-07 03:16:54,Twitter for iPhone,1,11

Trump: we are working well with industry. True. Trump is working for dirty oil companies. He is not to be trusted to fight climate change. Says he loves the environment. Just look what damage he has done on the environment in his almost 4 years. Judge his actions not words.,2020-10-23 02:26:26,Twitter for iPhone,1,11
Why should the American people trust  @JoeBiden over @realDonaldTrump on immigration? One values immigrants the other calls them criminals separates kids from their parents to deter and treats them inhumane. Biden will work with the @HispanicCaucus to pass immigration reform.,2020-10-23 02:09:06,Twitter for iPhone,1,6

Pence went on despite Susan Page asking him to stop. Only fair to allow Senator Harris to respond without interruption. Even if she made a prior point. What happened to equal time? #VPDebate,2020-10-08 02:23:29,Twitter for iPhone,23,234

My head hurts after watching that debate. I don’t know if we need another.  Especially because Trump doesn’t know how to follow the rules. He thinks he’s above the law and rules.,2020-09-30 02:46:51,Twitter for iPhone,9,66
Biden wraps presidential debate acting presidential saying he would accept the election results. What does Trump do?  Interrupt. Because Trump doesn’t know how to do the same be presidential.,2020-09-30 02:42:47,Twitter for iPhone,16,48

Ha. Wallace finally admits he also can’t keep up with Trump’s rantings.,2020-09-30 02:27:13,Twitter for iPhone,0,10
Wallace going through Biden’s enviro plan and talking now about cost. No mention from Wallace about the cost of not doing it - to our planet and public health. We must act on climate change now.  And let’s be clear Trump’s plan is to bail out Big Oil with taxpayer $$,2020-09-30 02:26:23,Twitter for iPhone,4,75
Trump knows nothing about climate change. Clearly doesn’t know what is environmental justice. He thinks our air is immaculate?  He hasn’t been to #CA44 and fails to read any air quality reports. But then remember he doesn’t read.,2020-09-30 02:19:48,Twitter for iPhone,1,7
Omg. Biden talking about his son Beau who served in the military (and later died) and Trump interrupts to insult his other son. What a disgrace. And Wallace just allowing this bullshit.,2020-09-30 02:16:38,Twitter for iPhone,202,1023
“He’s Putin’s puppy.” -Biden. Yes he is. Trump is Putin’s puppy.,2020-09-30 02:14:44,Twitter for iPhone,4,25
Trump has no credibility on healthcare. Remember he is trying to strip away healthcare from millions of Americans.,2020-09-30 02:12:44,Twitter for iPhone,21,106
Can we talk about Trump breaking the law? And those in his Administration.,2020-09-30 02:08:29,Twitter for iPhone,0,5
What the heck did Trump just say on race? I couldn’t even understand his answer on ending race sensitive training. Did i miss it or does he just have no clue what he’s talking about.,2020-09-30 02:03:15,Twitter for iPhone,0,10
Wallace tried to scold Trump  about not interrupting and Trump pointing finger like a kid saying well he did it too.  🤦🏽‍♀️,2020-09-30 01:54:31,Twitter for iPhone,0,2
Agree Trump is a clown. That’s putting it nicely.,2020-09-30 01:53:03,Twitter for iPhone,2,15
Wallace asking about Biden big spending but ignores the huge deficit caused by the huge Trump tax scam? Rolling Trump tax scam back can help fund healthcare infrastructure and help the middle class. Not help billionaires get more rich.,2020-09-30 01:47:37,Twitter for iPhone,6,13
Trump lying again. Now about his taxes. He says people who pay taxes and follow the rules are stupid.,2020-09-30 01:44:26,Twitter for iPhone,1,4
Wallace allowing Trump to insult too. If there is a next debate can we get some decorum and rules in place that are followed. No way we could do what Trump is doing on the House floor. I get this isn’t the House floor but this is supposed to be the President.  He’s embarrassing.,2020-09-30 01:39:08,Twitter for iPhone,49,240
Wallace allowing Trump to ramble then not giving Biden enough time to respond. And not shutting up Trump when he rudely interrupts. The mess continues.,2020-09-30 01:34:51,Twitter for iPhone,11,87
As Biden talks to those who lost someone to COVID Trump interrupts because he has no clue how to be compassionate. And show any empathy.,2020-09-30 01:28:14,Twitter for iPhone,37,150
Trump lying again. We are not weeks away from a vaccine.,2020-09-30 01:26:05,Twitter for iPhone,1,3
