Apparently the President doesn't agree their advice is more important than ever. https://t.co/P4fe8vz6CT,2020-06-23 22:48:26,Twitter Web App,60,130
Asked Dr. Fauci if President Trump is correct in saying we have "prevailed" over #COVID19.  Dr. Fauci: "We are still in the middle of a serious outbreak. There's no doubt about that." https://t.co/KngIzQvaPA,2020-06-23 21:15:49,Twitter Web App,16,36
Dr. Redfield wouldn't say when he last spoke to the president.  Dr. Fauci said he hasn't spoken to the president in 2 1/2 - 3 weeks.  Same for Admiral Giroir.  Commissioner Hahn said it's been "less than a month" since he spoke to the president.,2020-06-23 20:33:27,Twitter Web App,49,72
Clearly this President has decided the best strategy to deal with the greatest threat against this country during his presidency is to bury his head in the sand and wish it away.,2020-06-23 20:29:53,Twitter Web App,26,71
Instead of devoting time &amp; effort to taking this pandemic seriously Pres Trump is hosting campaign rallies: packing thousands of people together without masks in direct opposition to the guidance of all the public health experts.  Just so that he can hear crowds chant his name.,2020-06-23 20:29:10,Twitter Web App,17,40
President Trump last month declared “We have met the moment and we have prevailed.”  I asked Dr. Fauci if he agrees.  He does not.  He said "We are still in the middle of the pandemic.",2020-06-23 20:29:10,Twitter Web App,21,42
This pandemic is still raging.  119000+ Americans have died &amp; cases are still rising in 29 states with 20000+ new infections per day.  12 states set records for their most daily cases in the past week. ...  Meanwhile the Trump Administration seems to have moved on.,2020-06-23 20:29:10,Twitter Web App,73,157
Questioning Dr. Fauci of the NIH and Dr. Redfield of the CDC in @EnergyCommerce now: https://t.co/uKWvQ4abdq,2020-06-23 20:22:17,Twitter for iPhone,6,8
Dr. Fauci says he wears a mask to protect others to protect himself and to set an example for the American public.   @realdonaldtrump’s refusal to wear a mask speaks volumes about his inability to effectively respond to the #COVID19 crisis.   #WearAMask,2020-06-23 19:10:58,Twitter Web App,24,72
Dr. Fauci: don’t go into a crowd. If you do wear a mask.   If only the President &amp; his supporters would follow the leading doctor on #COVID19   If they did they would set an example &amp; help save lives. They won’t.  Think about it President is not doing all he can to save lives,2020-06-23 17:29:51,Twitter for iPhone,12,38
For too long Black and brown communities like mine have borne the burden of environmental and health inequities.   We need true Health and #EnvironmentalJustice.

The murder of #GeorgeFloyd by police was another example of a system that allows police brutality to continue without punishment or reform and puts Black people before an unequal justice system.

Being Black in America should not mean racial profiling brutality or other injustices.   The officer who killed #GeorgeFloyd didn’t see a man with hopes &amp; dreams. He didn’t even see a human being.    Black communities need to be protected &amp; served like everyone else.,2020-06-03 19:05:00,TweetDeck,7,24

Trump has to stop calling #Coronavirus the “Chinese virus.” He refused to denounce a staffer who called it “Kung flu.”   Racist language has to stop. It’s wrong.  #COVID19 affects all of us. Doesn’t help to attribute it to one nationality.  Breeds fear and racism to Asian people.,2020-03-18 17:16:57,Twitter Web App,33,128
Trump just said it's “a fact of life” the rich &amp; well-connected can get #COVID19 tests right away but most people have to wait  This may be true but it is immoral. It must change  His job is to make sure ALL people get tested if they need not just dismiss it as a “Fact of life.”,2020-03-18 17:10:51,Twitter Web App,32,92

19 colleagues and I urged the WH not to include a fossil fuel bailout in any #Coronavirus stimulus package.   Diverting public funds to bail out #BigOil will do nothing to stop the spread of #COVID19 or help people.

President just doesn’t understand how things work. #COVID19 is in the US. We don’t know how bad because we are not testing enough. Huge failure. And unequal access to testing is another huge problem.

It is wrong for the Trump Admin. to restrict $ states can use to fight #COVID19. We need every tool available   But Trump is making a political point by restricting use of Medicaid–making it harder for low-income people to get testing or medical help.  https://t.co/fzMmWQtISC,2020-03-13 15:49:50,Twitter Web App,22,35

Diverting public $ to bail out #BigOil will do nothing to stop the spread of #COVID19 or help those affected.  Using this crisis as an excuse for another giveaway to oil &amp; gas is badly misguided.

In honor of #HolocaustRemembranceDay I’m pleased to preside over the House vote on #HR943 the Never Again Education Act which supports expansion of Holocaust education programs for educators.

Trump's NSA – who had firsthand knowledge – says Trump tied Ukraine aid to political help. #BoltonBombshell    This directly contradicts Trump’s #Impeachment defense.  His legal team cannot refute the facts.   #DefendOurDemocracy #BoltonMustTestify https://t.co/eXEV1qhVlG,2020-01-27 17:14:00,Twitter Web App,18,43
Trump Admin’s unfairness towards immigrants is forcing judges to quit.   “Judges say it is impossible to work under the new system and still guarantee migrants their due process rights”  @mollyhf in today’s @latimes   #ImmigrantsWelcome @HispanicCaucus   https://t.co/o5DSb8d5f7,2020-01-27 16:11:07,Twitter Web App,42,63
Stunned at the passing of @lakers Legend Kobe Bryant and his daughter Gianna.  I join his family Angelenos and the entire @NBA community in mourning  his tragic loss.   Just last year he brought joy to youth in #WilmingtonCA #CA44 with his visit to the Boys &amp; Girls Club.,2020-01-26 21:31:09,Twitter for iPhone,38,175
3 of 3: This type of environmental injustice doesn’t seem to happen in communities like Beverly Hills or West Hollywood.  Our communities in #sogate #watts and #cudahyca deserve the same respect and accountability from @Delta     #EnvironmentalInjustice #CA44,2020-01-26 01:50:55,Twitter for iPhone,8,34
2 of 3: It is shameful that @Delta representatives *did not show up* to look members of our community in the eyes and take responsibility.,2020-01-26 01:48:24,Twitter for iPhone,5,25
1 of 3 Appreciate the leadership of @SoGateCAgov for hosting today’s special meeting on the fuel dump in #CA44.  @Delta needs to take full responsibility and be accountable to our community. Their pilot their plane and their protocol allowed fuel to be dumped on schools &amp; homes.,2020-01-26 01:47:11,Twitter for iPhone,9,42
#Impeachment case has been laid out clearly. Trump abused his power to cheat our elections and - despite admitting it - tried to cover it up.  The facts are overwhelming.  If a witness might tell a different story GOP senators might want to hear it.  #DefendOurDemocracy,2020-01-25 14:01:51,Twitter for iPhone,27,110

Los Senadores tendrán que responder una simple pregunta:  ¿No les preocupa que un futuro presidente pueda usar el mismo argumento en su contra en una investigación del Senado para negarse a presentar CUALQUIER documento?  #DefendOurDemocracy,2020-01-24 19:49:37,Twitter Web App,9,15
The WH’s #DirtyWaterRule is bad for all of us but especially bad for California.   “The changes to the Clean Water Act’s protections are expected to hit California and other Western states especially hard” @annamphillips   https://t.co/gr9iwpCsAy,2020-01-24 17:29:44,Twitter Web App,25,24
When a Delta flight dumped fuel over #CA44 they injured more than 50 people including children.  My colleagues and I sent a letter to FAA Administrator Steve Dickson demanding answers about how this happened.  https://t.co/DAdcVamivs https://t.co/h6TTcDVI8d,2020-01-24 16:13:19,Twitter Web App,21,43
#RoeVWade established reproductive choice as the law of the land. Abortion is legal.   It is outrageous the WH would threaten health care $ for CA families because our state ensures abortion coverage to every woman with private insurance. @PPFA @NARAL    https://t.co/J1hpevw4SK,2020-01-24 16:03:20,Twitter Web App,16,35
Sitting on the Senate floor to witness historic #ImpeachmentTrials was an honor. Biggest surprise was hearing #baseball become part of the congressional record on impeachment. Biggest moment was @RepAdamSchiff closing. Because #RightMatters #DefendOurDemocracy,2020-01-24 06:21:15,Twitter for iPhone,52,205
Los hechos de este caso son indiscutibles. El presidente abusó de su poder y obstruyó el Congreso cuando fue descubierto.   Este presidente es un peligro para nuestra Constitución y por eso tenemos que condenarlo y destituirlo de su cargo.  #DefendOurDemocracy,2020-01-23 20:41:02,Twitter Web App,11,21
El abuso de poder de Trump es algo que vemos en países con dictadores pero su comportamiento no está en línea con nuestra constitución.  En los EE. UU. no tenemos un rey o dictador. El presidente tiene que seguir nuestras leyes y por eso tenemos que mantenerlo responsable.,2020-01-23 20:16:02,Twitter for iPhone,17,48

Trump Admin’s #DirtyWaterRule will wipe out protections for streams that provide drinking water to millions.  @HouseDemocrats are working to #ProtectCleanWater  “This will be the biggest loss of clean water protection the country has ever seen” @selc_org   https://t.co/Sqx8JEUmin,2020-01-23 19:32:36,Twitter Web App,24,25
On the 47th An. of #RoeVWade too many people don’t have access to basic health care. I won’t stop fighting to protect access to safe legal abortion.   It’s why I co-sponsored the EACH Woman Act.  Every woman should be able to make her own decisions about her pregnancy.   #Roe47 https://t.co/mksrIoXwdj,2020-01-22 21:33:34,Twitter Web App,16,26

.@RepValDemings is an impeachment mgr.  An ex-police chief she said she’s never seen anyone argue to exclude evidence that proved they were innocent.   Why are President Trump and the Senate Republicans fighting so hard to keep evidence and witnesses out?    #DefendOurDemocracy,2020-01-22 16:02:15,Twitter Web App,36,105

Who is Sen. McConnell serving with a dark-of-night trial that hides key witnesses and hides important evidence from the American people?  Is he loyal to the president or loyal to the truth and a fair trial?  Is this going to be a trial or a coverup?  #DefendOurDemocracy,2020-01-21 18:35:51,Twitter Web App,25,69
