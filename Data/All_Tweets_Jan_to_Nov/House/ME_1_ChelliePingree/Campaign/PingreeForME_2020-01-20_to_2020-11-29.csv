From my seat on the Appropriations Committee my number one priority will remain providing more resources to Mainers fighting to survive this crisis &amp; delivering federal funds to our state. Holding this office is a sacred trust and I cannot wait to get started on the work ahead.,2020-11-04 05:28:07,Twitter Web App,0,2
Congress must act with urgency to send pandemic relief directly to thousands of Mainers and millions of Americans trying to survive the pandemic defend the Affordable Care Act under dire threat and combat the climate crisis ravaging our planet.,2020-11-04 05:28:07,Twitter Web App,1,7

The people of Maine need a President who will fight for them no matter what especially in the wake of an unchecked pandemic that has killed 200000 Americans wreaked havoc on the economy and shed light on Donald Trump's total disregard for science and human life. #mepolitics,2020-09-30 02:41:48,Twitter Web App,2,3
