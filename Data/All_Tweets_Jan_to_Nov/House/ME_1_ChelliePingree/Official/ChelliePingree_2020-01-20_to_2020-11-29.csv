#OTD 3 years ago President Trump issued a bigoted travel ban stranding Banah Al-Hanfy in Iraq. Trump halted her travel to Maine just because of where she was from.  Banah was my SOTU guest and then intern. I'm so proud of her. #NoMuslimBanEver https://t.co/7NHqDSViBY,2020-01-27 18:03:09,Twitter Web App,2,35

Today Trump officially announced his #DirtyWaterRule to remove MILLIONS of miles of streams &amp; HALF of US wetlands from Clean Water Act protection (which was written by Maine’s own Ed Muskie in the 70s).

ICYMI Pres Trump today suggested he would try to slash Social Security and Medicare in a second term.   This is happening while he continues to attack the ACA in court.

It doesn’t take a detective to figure out why a former oil lobbyist turned Interior secretary would green light a project that keeps the nation dependent on fossil fuels. This decision imperils our environment and public health. #NoKXL https://t.co/UPx0P2TkqZ,2020-01-22 21:26:25,Twitter Web Client,5,21
#OTD 47 years ago SCOTUS ruled that women have the right to make their own health care decisions and to legally access abortion care in #RoevsWade.

From their first day as a part of a den Scouts are taught leadership skills that will follow them through the rest of their lives. Last night I got to meet with the Pack 66 WEBELOS from Portland as a step on their way to becoming Boy Scouts later this year.

#OTD 10 years ago SCOTUS decided Citizens United which opened up our elections to dark money &amp; super PACs.
