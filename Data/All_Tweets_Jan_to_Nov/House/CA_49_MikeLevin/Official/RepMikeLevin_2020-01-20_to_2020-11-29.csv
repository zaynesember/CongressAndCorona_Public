Trump’s payroll tax cut isn’t the type of financial relief we need.   In fact it’s a burdensome loan that will have to be paid back starting January 2021 and potentially problematic for our military families and others.  https://t.co/6SKen211Rw,2020-09-16 13:22:03,Twitter for iPhone,17,45

These comments from Trump are vile. Servicemembers &amp; POWs who made the ultimate sacrifice for our freedom aren't "losers" or "suckers" they're heroes.
