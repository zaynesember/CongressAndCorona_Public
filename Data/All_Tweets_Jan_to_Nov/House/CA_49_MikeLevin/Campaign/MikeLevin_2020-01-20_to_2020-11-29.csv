Trump says he “wanted to play it down” because he didn’t want panic.

It’s obvious why Trump is discrediting voting by mail and sabotaging the USPS.  New polling says Biden supporters plan to vote by mail 62-36.  Trump supporters plan to vote in person 72-24.

Over 109000 Americans are tragically dead of #COVID19.  Over 21 million are still out of work.  Many state and local budgets are collapsing.  Now isn’t the time to declare “Mission Accomplished” or take a pause.  We need continued action to support the American people.,2020-06-07 18:13:36,Twitter for iPhone,72,197
Thanks to everyone here in #CA49 who joined us this afternoon to increase #GunViolenceAwareness. This weekend we #WearOrange for the more than 36000 Americans we lose each year to gun violence who deserve so much more than just our words.

Every day we see the need for further action to combat the #COVID19 crisis:   Over 107000 dead.  Nearly 1.9M cases.  42.6M unemployment claims in the past 11 weeks.  Mitch McConnell it’s past time to act on the relief bill we sent you.  @senatemajldr what are you waiting for?,2020-06-04 16:09:28,Twitter for iPhone,155,371

The only way I see us getting through this is if we start listening to one another start helping each other start advocating for one another and then we all need to speak up the loudest for those who need the most help. That's how we are going to bring about real change. (8/8),2020-06-03 15:58:55,Twitter for iPhone,15,55
40M+ Americans have lost their jobs due to #COVID19. I’ve spoken with so many who have lost their jobs can't pay their rent and also with veterans and seniors who are worried about where they are going to get their next meal — our nation is in crisis. On multiple levels. (7/8),2020-06-03 15:58:30,Twitter for iPhone,19,50
At the same time when a small minority of people take advantage of the situation to commit violent acts they need to realize that their actions undermine the message of peaceful protesters and they're also putting other people's lives at risk. (6/8),2020-06-03 15:56:14,Twitter for iPhone,14,44
To protest is patriotic. Those peacefully protesting across our nation have every right to express frustration over the unequal economic and criminal justice systems in our country. If our democracy is to survive we must guarantee the right to assemble and to be heard. (5/8),2020-06-03 15:55:49,Twitter for iPhone,15,59
The offenses committed by the four peace officers in Minneapolis were abhorrent and inconsistent with our values. I agree with the peace officers of @PORACalifornia who believe that we must now develop a national standard regarding use of force training and recruitment. (4/8),2020-06-03 15:54:43,Twitter for iPhone,16,54
Unfortunately what happened in Minneapolis — and similar tragedies that have happened in cities across America — damages the trust and confidence in our nation's law enforcement agencies. (3/8),2020-06-03 15:51:23,Twitter for iPhone,12,44
We continue to witness an unequal criminal justice system in this country and I agree with @BarackObama that we all must raise awareness organize and then cast our ballots in support of candidates who will make real reforms. Our democracy is on the ballot this November. (2/8),2020-06-03 15:51:07,Twitter for iPhone,18,57
The death of George Floyd is tragic and the loss of another African American life especially so given the corrosive role racism has played in our nation's history. The 14th Amendment calls for equal justice under the law. Black Lives Matter. We must stand for nothing less: (1/8),2020-06-03 15:49:33,Twitter for iPhone,168,477

I just read the testing “plan” submitted by the administration to Congress as required by law.  It’s lacking in details accountability and reality.

Mitch McConnell said we should let local governments go bankrupt.  Then he said we should pause.   But COVID isn’t taking a pause.

New reporting on John Bolton directly contradicts the heart of Trump’s defense.  Bolton must be called by the Senate as a witness.  The American people must reject a Mitch McConnell orchestrated cover-up.,2020-01-27 16:18:39,Twitter for iPhone,164,634
We must hear from John Bolton. https://t.co/9uAEdCpNXA,2020-01-27 00:31:43,Twitter for iPhone,43,210
I am incredibly saddened to learn of the tragic passing of Kobe Bryant.  He meant so much to us in Southern California who grew up watching his greatness on the court. My prayers are with his family and the families of the other victims.,2020-01-26 20:20:55,Twitter for iPhone,74,485

We must protect and strengthen Social Security and Medicare.  Trump and the Republicans won’t.  We will.  It’s that simple!  https://t.co/ke6nLEwAKi,2020-01-25 17:34:38,Twitter for iPhone,120,251
The Senate needs to consider all relevant evidence including this.  https://t.co/Zf5l2zbyHO,2020-01-24 20:33:42,Twitter for iPhone,155,470
Anyone else find it ridiculous that Senate Republicans complain about “not hearing anything new” while simultaneously opposing anything new like testimony from witnesses or new documents?,2020-01-24 14:28:33,Twitter for iPhone,471,1953
The truth will come out.  Shouldn’t Senators want to hear it now?  Shouldn't we hear from those witnesses and see those documents now?   The American people want and deserve a fair trial.,2020-01-23 20:29:19,Twitter for iPhone,56,247
Trump’s tax scheme was a massive giveaway to the wealthy and big corporations.  It has added $1.9 trillion and counting to our debt.  Now they want to pay for it by slashing Social Security &amp; Medicare.  This is a total betrayal of middle class families. https://t.co/Q335m4LgUt,2020-01-23 16:02:13,Twitter for iPhone,386,557
One homeless veteran is one too many and that’s why I’m working across the aisle to help address the issue.   This @WSJ article follows my recent hearing on veteran homelessness which included local experts. https://t.co/DrqCIMMm4z,2020-01-23 12:59:36,Twitter for iPhone,79,157

Reminder that recent polls show the public strongly backs having witnesses at the Senate trial:  Quinnipiac: 66%-17% Morning Consult/Politico: 57%-24% CNN: 69%-26% Wash Post/ABC News: 71%-22%  What exactly is @senatemajldr afraid we’ll find out?,2020-01-22 17:02:14,Twitter for iPhone,8181,22010
Wow. Even Jonathan Turley the sole scholar called by House Republicans to testify about the legal basis for impeachment says Trump’s defense strategy “is as politically unwise as it is constitutionally shortsighted.” https://t.co/UObyAK6t1m,2020-01-22 14:49:09,Twitter for iPhone,196,487

“Why would an innocent man and a jury interested in the truth not want all the evidence out and all the witnesses to testify? Wouldn’t you if you were innocent?” https://t.co/6o9z0mg7CS,2020-01-22 02:40:59,Twitter for iPhone,90,284
10 years ago the Citizens United decision unleashed the influence of dark money &amp; special interest corporations. We need to crack down on political corruption reject their money &amp; advocate for a Constitutional Amendment to reverse this disastrous SCOTUS decision. @StopBigMoney https://t.co/SIfWsYgUJ3,2020-01-22 00:17:13,Twitter for iPhone,61,148
The Senate has a constitutional duty to hold a fair trial not aid in a cover-up.  Any sort of vindication is impossible if the trial is rigged.,2020-01-21 16:54:26,Twitter for iPhone,83,349
