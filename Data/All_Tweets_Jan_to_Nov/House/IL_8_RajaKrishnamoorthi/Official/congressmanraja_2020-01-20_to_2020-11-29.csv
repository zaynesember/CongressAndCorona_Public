To contain &amp; treat COVID-19 we need to test widely for it. That's how we prevent patients from spreading it &amp; ensure they get the care they need.

But as we move forward we must do so in the spirit of healing &amp; reconciliation.

My investigation found that as the Administration endangered passengers at O'Hare by failing to ensure social distancing it also failed to ensure that people entering the US from countries with outbreaks except for China were screened for coronavirus. https://t.co/qokvVhwjFZ,2020-05-08 17:01:37,Hootsuite Inc.,70,152
My investigation found that as the Administration instituted its travel ban Americans fleeing coronavirus outbreaks in Asian and Europe were not rigorously screened on their return limiting our ability to contain the disease or treat those who had it. https://t.co/CWIXB3ZYVt,2020-05-08 15:16:45,Hootsuite Inc.,43,123
Yesterday I released information from my investigation into how this Admin failed to effectively screen travelers from Italy or South Korea even after imposing a travel ban from China &amp; did little else to stop the inflow of COVID through our airports. https://t.co/PEeb3ooewn,2020-05-08 13:01:58,Hootsuite Inc.,207,324

Yesterday there were 2673 lives lost to COVID-19 in Illinois alone. That’s 170 more deaths than the day before. Why the President thinks it’s time to phase out the Coronavirus Task Force is beyond me. https://t.co/4N0dKfn95G,2020-05-06 19:01:13,Hootsuite Inc.,44,176

Though they may be key in our efforts to re-open the country antibody tests do NOT double as #coronavirus testing kits.

On top of the current scientific and medical limitations of serological antibody tests my investigation into the administration's handling of these tests has revealed that the FDA is unable to validate their accuracy and has allowed junk tests to flood the market. https://t.co/mt8ndqVEuk,2020-04-25 19:06:28,Twitter Web App,60,131

Antibody testing for #COVID19 could eventually be a critical tool for reopening the economy. But the tests currently on the market have not been validated by the #FDA. Many have been fraudulently marketed and others simply do not work. https://t.co/IZZhC67UAn,2020-04-25 15:11:40,Hootsuite Inc.,34,79

Not only do the tests need to work doctors and patients need to know how to use them effectively to fight COVID-19.  The CDC must put out guidance ASAP about if and when antibody tests should be used and what to do with the results. Not doing so will risk more lives.,2020-04-25 03:29:03,Twitter Web App,23,83
There’s still time to fix this. Commissioner Hahn and the FDA can require test-makers to submit data and tests to review crack down on the bad actors get junk tests off the market and ensure only effective tests are used to fight COVID-19. The FDA needs to act now.,2020-04-25 03:29:03,Twitter Web App,18,84
Hahn said FDA provided “flexibility” in the marketing of serological tests but that’s just a euphemism for “laissez-faire.” “Flexibility” has allowed junk tests to flood the markets sacrificing quality and reliability for the sake of free market access.,2020-04-25 03:29:02,Twitter Web App,5,25
The National Cancer Institute voluntary review program is designed for failure because there is no plan for FDA to review tests it doesn’t receive. Junk test-makers won’t voluntarily give their tests to the government to reveal they don't work; they'll just keep selling them.,2020-04-25 03:29:02,Twitter Web App,4,19
Commissioner Hahn has characterized the antibody tests the FDA has failed to review as “self-validated.” Given the presence of so many faulty tests on the market it might be more fitting to describe them as “unregulated” and that is a serious problem.,2020-04-25 03:29:02,Twitter Web App,6,22
The FDA isn’t even asking serological test-makers for validation data or documents to support their claims: it's just accepting those claims at face value and allowing companies to sell their products. Because of this failed policy there are bogus COVID-19 tests on the market.,2020-04-25 03:29:01,Twitter Web App,8,28
Commissioner Hahn didn’t deny my subcommittee’s staff findings that the FDA hasn’t been validating the effectiveness of serological tests for COVID-19; it’s just taking the word of the test-makers that they validated their test and are following FDA rules. https://t.co/MtoEaUweYK,2020-04-25 03:29:01,Twitter Web App,10,26
I'm disappointed by #FDA Commissioner Hahn's response to a question about my subcommittee's investigation into the major flaws in the Administration's handling of coronavirus serology testing and the fact that the FDA doesn't know whether the tests currently on the market work. https://t.co/PhuuJluRNr,2020-04-25 03:29:00,Twitter Web App,71,223
Serological testing for #COVID19 could eventually be a critical tool because these blood tests could potentially provide an efficient way to detect who's had the disease.

The @US_FDA has not authorized any at-home tests for coronavirus but companies are taking consumers' money for tests that may not work. People are scared. No one should be preying upon their fears of #COVIDー19 with false promises.   https://t.co/aS8jdTsdyj,2020-03-26 14:47:50,Twitter Web App,31,68

We need to pass a stimulus as soon as possible but it needs to be one focused on helping workers families and small businesses.

In NYC the Michelin-starred restaurant @jejunoodlebar initially planned to offer delivery and takeout after the city closed all restaraunt dining rooms but then decided not to because of the staff’s fears about recent racist attacks on Asian-Americans. https://t.co/cja6KlXcCL,2020-03-23 14:30:56,Twitter Web App,16,50

Last night I spoke with @AliVelshi about Lt. Col. Vindman and all the brave and honorable Americans like him who put their country before their own best interests. It's the right and honorable thing to do and THAT’s the point. https://t.co/behkkjB7Qo,2020-02-08 16:39:29,Twitter Media Studio,44,194
Lt. Col. Vindman is an American hero who has served our nation with honor and distinction both overseas and in the White House. He has put his commitment to this country ahead of himself and it appears the Trump Administration is now punishing him for that commitment. https://t.co/8KUXLfPte0,2020-02-07 22:18:32,Twitter Web App,76,331

It is unconscionable that this Administration would threaten to withhold disaster aid to #PuertoRico in the wake of devastating #earthquakes. My vote in favor of H.R. 5687 today is a vote against abandoning our fellow Americans. https://t.co/KzuLQTVLIV,2020-02-07 18:57:23,Twitter Web App,66,188
My op-ed on reducing bullying published in @TheAdvocateMag stresses the importance of anti-bullying legislation and highlights my work with @GLSEN on the #STOPBullying Act which would combat harassment in schools especially for #LGBTQ+ students. https://t.co/GEfcPBUa1G,2020-02-07 16:15:40,Twitter Web App,16,63
I spoke on @FoxNews about my work with @CongressmanGT to modernize our nation’s skills-based &amp; vocational education system. It is essential that Congress continues to engage in bipartisan efforts like this one to work across party lines &amp; get things done for the American people. https://t.co/xy2hEwnzPr,2020-02-06 23:07:10,Twitter Media Studio,17,92

"#SNAP works. #SNAP helps people. It helps adults. It helps children. It helps educators. It helps the economy. It has the lowest fraud rate of practically any government program.” https://t.co/5gmm22YAQC,2020-02-06 18:30:00,TweetDeck,24,99
"The people who utilize these benefits are just like you and me. In fact I was one of those people. At the end of the day what we do with #SNAP defines who we are as a country. And... as the late great Chairman Cummings said 'we are better than this.'" https://t.co/tDQocWHn7Z,2020-02-06 17:43:14,Twitter Media Studio,30,86
Welcome to the @OversightDems Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy @RepKatiePorter! Your questions highlighting the incredible burden placed on #SNAP benefit applicants were 🔥 🔥 🔥 https://t.co/63krZLH6Ib,2020-02-06 16:52:40,Twitter Media Studio,111,454
I know firsthand the difference #SNAP makes for families that would otherwise go hungry. “When [my family] needed help we were able to receive food stamps as my parents worked their way out of that difficult time." This is the American dream. https://t.co/bZ8nlyIAf2,2020-02-06 16:28:04,Twitter Media Studio,82,309
.@OversightDems hearing on #SNAP is full right now as we hear from teachers principals and advocates on how vital this program is for American children. The Trump Administration’s #SNAP cuts will undoubtedly hurt families across the country. https://t.co/C0ljykNBhY,2020-02-06 16:17:57,Twitter Web App,58,107

Senator Romney's decision today reminds me of one of my favorite passages from President Kennedy's Profiles In Courage "A man does what he must—in spite of personal consequences in spite of obstacles and dangers and pressures – and that is the basis of all human morality.” https://t.co/lNwPnvOMch,2020-02-05 19:39:11,Twitter Web App,204,755
