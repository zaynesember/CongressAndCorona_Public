Trump said immigrant children are "well taken care of." Nothing could be further from the truth.  He tore them from their parents' arms. Put them in cages. Forced them to sleep on concrete floors.

Trump knew how dangerous COVID-19 was and nearly 200000 people have died because of his inaction.  This is his legacy but we cannot allow it to be our future. We must vote him out. https://t.co/v2gjBkNLI7,2020-09-09 18:36:55,Twitter Web App,45,196
“Below average” is too generous. We pay more per capita for health care than any other country only to maintain a for-profit system that left 87 million people uninsured or underinsured BEFORE COVID-19 hit. Now millions more are without care.   It’s time to pass #MedicareForAll. https://t.co/KQ8JYktRKS,2020-09-09 01:19:01,Twitter Web App,61,231

This pandemic is a sobering reminder of why we must fight for workers’ rights.

Here’s what Donald Trump doesn’t want you to know:  More than 250 million ballots have been cast by mail over the past two decades.  The fraud rate is 0.00006%.  Vote-by-mail isn’t fraudulent — his false attacks are.,2020-09-06 14:14:02,Twitter Web App,289,886

Disgusting and dangerous. We've long known that Trump incites violence but we continue to see Republican candidates do the same. They think it shows strength to make threats.

“It’s a time of crisis and having a health-care system that’s a public strategic asset rather than a business run for profit allows for a degree of coordination and optimal use of resources.” #MedicareForAll,2020-03-16 01:21:02,Twitter Web App,33,99
Excellent article on how much better prepared single-payer systems are to cope with #Coronavirus: "W/o need to coordinate w/insurance companies over costs Denmark moved quickly to address pandemic...strength of system is highly educated &amp; well-trained staff." #MedicareForAll,2020-03-16 01:19:19,Twitter Web App,142,482
.@BernieSanders &amp; I would ensure that undocumented immigrants are covered in #MedicareForAll. That's good for them and for public health in a crisis like #COVID19.,2020-03-16 00:36:33,Twitter Web App,70,257
I don't think anyone should argue that Wall Street bailout at taxpayer expense was a good idea. In fact the failure of that bailout has led to a different approach this time: with Congress prioritizing working people first. That means maybe we learned something &amp; that's good.,2020-03-16 00:33:59,Twitter Web App,48,211
These are real policy choices about how we prepare for these crises--not just how we respond in the moment. But don't forget that if we prepared ahead of time the responses in the moment would be more effective. The two go together. #MedicareForAll,2020-03-16 00:20:49,Twitter Web App,43,126
If we had invested in strong HC system we'd have more doctors &amp; hospital beds &amp; less vulnerable people w/ underlying medical issues which few talk about. None of this means we don't also need emergency responses now. But don't say broken HC system isn't an issue it is.,2020-03-16 00:19:29,Twitter Web App,73,202
It simply isn't true that all treatment for #COVID19 is covered. We literally just made testing free but rest of treatment IS NOT covered: hospitalization drugs etc. While #MedicareForAll doesn't solve everything it does address the deep systemic problems in our system.,2020-03-16 00:16:22,Twitter Web App,642,1872
I’d like to hear more about how @JoeBiden will fight for this policy if he is president &amp; I hope he‘ll also embrace the changes we need to take on our for-profit health care system—the consequences of which are part of the devastation we face now in a public health crisis.,2020-03-15 23:44:13,Twitter for iPhone,7,43

If we want to talk abt what is wrong it should be that we still have 70 mm uninsured or underinsured; 160 mm ppl with same wealth as 3 richest Americans; &amp; 56000 ppl locked up in immigration jails every single night in America even with no charges or convictions.

Finally total # votes cast in WA: earlier today we had 1.6 MM ballots in. Possible to hit 2 MM with add’l ballots mailed. That’s big turnout tho no direct comparison since we had caucuses last yr. 2018 primary had 1.7 MM votes.

3. #Coronavirus mattered on several levels.  People very worried about it which may have affected decisions. But also had to cancel events from campaigns so voters didn’t have that final last excitement and energy to focus on. Still record primary turnout which is fantastic!,2020-03-11 04:08:20,Twitter for iPad,20,123
2. King County (inclu my district &amp; #Seattle) has a huge number of votes &amp; does trend more progressive with later voters. Some of this will depend on what Warren supporters did at the end.,2020-03-11 04:06:55,Twitter for iPad,31,187
Some important things to note in #WA state: too early and too close. We will only know the total number of votes cast over the next three days because we are mail-in state. So when you see the % of votes counted on TV don’t take that as true b/c we don’t have all the ballots in.,2020-03-11 04:04:26,Twitter for iPad,141,697

7. If you didn’t use your power to do things that elevated black &amp; brown folks or if you did serious long-term damage to black &amp; brown folks don’t ask us to trust you w/o establishing new track record 1st.  Forgiveness requires action. Certainly if you are running for President,2020-02-14 16:51:49,Twitter for iPad,18,152
6. Don’t ask us to forgive racism because someone seems fresh and smart or because someone has a lot of money or because someone was good on some other policy issue.,2020-02-14 16:50:25,Twitter for iPad,18,152
5. Apologies for the past are good—necessary even.  People change we recognize that and we WANT that. But don’t ask us to just believe you.  Don’t ask us to silence our criticisms and critiques in the name of unity—and certainly not during a presidential primary.,2020-02-14 16:49:40,Twitter for iPad,20,142
4. I have spoken for my entire life about the need to call people in as well as call people out. But when the calling out gets silenced because people feel uncomfortable about making big bold structural change that WOULD actually shift the balance of power then I will call out,2020-02-14 16:49:09,Twitter for iPad,15,134
3. I considered cutting the beginning part with the question to just have Baldwin’s answer but I left the whole clip because I found myself seething and cringing at the arrogance &amp; superiority—&amp; dismissiveness—of the questioner and it felt both familiar and necessary to include.,2020-02-14 16:48:29,Twitter for iPad,12,137
2. It is why it is offensive and insuffficient to tell people of color to just trust someone—particularly those running for President— who does not have experience of putting themselves on the line to fight racism—or has a terrible record of racist policy that harmed millions.,2020-02-14 16:47:49,Twitter for iPad,21,185

With respect apologies are good. But track record really matters. Long-term harm of what has been done &amp; the institutionalized racism—coming from the top—is what must be at the center of every decision particularly when selecting a president.,2020-02-14 15:56:04,Twitter for iPad,357,2011

Any full remedy to money in politics must overturn #CitizensUnited but also make clear that corporations don’t have constitutional rights.

Here’s the thing: we knew @BernieSanders would win Iowa.
