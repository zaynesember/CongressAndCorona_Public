Here's the truth: Trump has pursued an immigration policy of maximum cruelty and maximum harm. During COVID-19 that has meant putting lives at risk in ICE detention centers.

The $600/week of assistance helped families stay afloat during these dire circumstances. By cruelly taking it away Trump &amp; Republicans turned their backs on millions.

The worst way to get relief to small businesses is to rely on banks to administer loans instead of sending grants directly to them.

As Amazon makes billions during a pandemic workers get infected with the virus. This is what happens when you cut hazard pay and sick leave—people get sick and are forced to either risk their lives or risk their paycheck. Amazon needs to finally put people over profits. https://t.co/DV6Djcwovp,2020-10-03 20:18:04,Twitter Web App,330,1058

COVID-19 is devastating for millions. It's why we need to get additional relief out NOW. It's why we need to guarantee health care.

Takeaway #5 from Trump's tax returns:  😡He made huge $$$ from being president. Trump DC hotel where lobbyists stay to curry favor went from $3.7 million/monthly receipts in Dec.

Five major takeaways from Trump's tax returns:  😡He paid NO income taxes in 10 of past 15 years. In 2016 and 2017 he paid only $750.

We must get relief to schools and educators across this country.   ✅The House bill includes $100 billion in education funds   ❌The Republican bill actually takes money AWAY from public schools and dangerously pressures schools to re-open even if it’s not safe to do so yet,2020-09-10 01:19:38,Twitter Web App,27,97

To help people withstand this crisis we must renew expanded unemployment assistance by the FULL $600 a week.    ✅The House plan does this   ❌The Republican bill fails to do this (it actually slashes benefits in half which then expire in December),2020-09-10 01:19:37,Twitter Web App,14,44
Millions of people have lost their jobs housing and health care during COVID-19. We must respond with policies that match the scale of this unprecedented crisis. The new Republican bill in the Senate FAILS to do that.   RT to share 6 reasons why:,2020-09-10 01:19:36,Twitter Web App,127,345
Our cities are unrecognizable as our communities are on fire once again. The climate crisis isn't in the distant future—it's here. We need bold climate action that matches the scale of this crisis.

Finally this bill develops a clearinghouse and web portal of information on heart health research.

South Asian Americans also have a much greater chance of having a heart attack before age 50 and have emerged as the ethnic group with the highest prevalence of Type 2 diabetes which is a leading cause of heart disease.

First DeJoy corruptly bought his position.

As the pandemic took off between March and May Border Patrol didn't test a single immigrant for COVID-19.

Whether the unemployment rate is 11% or 8.4% it is undeniable that families need more relief to withstand this crisis as one million new people are filing for unemployment each week.

To stop this devastation we need solutions that match the scale of the crisis.

The more we learn about DeJoy the more corruption and the more misconduct is brought to light.

In order to defeat the virus we need a vaccine that people can trust. Trump's politicization of the CDC spreading of conspiracy theories and lack of a testing strategy do nothing to help.

Labor unions are vastly popular across the country at a time when workers' rights are too often under attack.

Our for-profit health care system means that as people lose their jobs during this crisis they also lose their insurance. It's long overdue that we stop tying health care to employment. We need Medicare for All. https://t.co/KWMxBqG4IE,2020-09-06 01:00:01,TweetDeck,243,815

Absolutely. Republicans weren't concerned when they passed a $2 trillion tax cut for corporations and the ultra-wealthy. They weren't concerned by the $740 billion annual Pentagon budget.

Emmett Till was lynched 65 years ago today. He was only 14. But racist killings aren't just a thing of the past.

Mass unemployment is a policy choice. Other countries chose differently responding at the scale necessary. The US hasn't.

Trump calls immigrants animals &amp; an infestation says they're invading. So a white supremacist crosses TX to murder 23 people.

It's corruption through and through:  DeJoy is a Trump megadonor with enormous stock in companies that benefit from privatizing the USPS.

I called on House Leadership to reconvene Congress so we could fully combat Trump’s dangerous sabotage of the USPS and our elections. The House just voted to do exactly that—reversing DeJoy's attacks and funding the Postal Service.

It's not unexpected at all. This mass unemployment crisis will continue until we implement policies that match its scale and get real relief to people.

Banning tear gas in only one city isn't enough.  Banning tear gas in only one city for just 30 days (and then using it the next night anyway) is definitely not enough.

Yes he shouldn't have been there.  But Trump will continue attempts to weaponize the military against its own citizens—against us—until we stop him.

This legislation is a bold step towards justice and accountability. I'll fight to swiftly move it though Congress.   We need everyone across the country to continue building the public pressure necessary to get this approved by the House passed in the Senate and signed into law.,2020-06-08 16:35:19,Twitter Web App,41,160
8⃣It works to END the militarization of law enforcement by restricting the program that allows military equipment to transfer to local departments.   It also requires federal state and local law enforcement to use existing federal funds to ensure the use of police body cameras.,2020-06-08 16:33:20,Twitter Web App,39,179
7⃣It gives DOJ the power to subpoena law enforcement departments for pattern and practice investigations which allows them to hold accountable agencies who violate the constitution or other federal laws.   It also establishes a National Task Force on Law Enforcement Oversight.,2020-06-08 16:32:21,Twitter Web App,26,117
6⃣This bill allows prosecutors to hold officers accountable for the deprivation of civil rights AND civil liberties by changing the mens rea requirement from “willful” to “knowingly or with reckless disregard”.   This improves accountability for police brutality and misconduct.,2020-06-08 16:31:05,Twitter Web App,25,123
5⃣It requires the reporting of ALL incidents of use of force against a civilian to the Justice Department and mandates that demographic data and an explanation of the incident are included too.   It also collects data on law enforcement practices such as stops and searches.,2020-06-08 16:30:03,Twitter Web App,24,118
4⃣It finally ends qualified immunity.   This ensures that we are able to hold accountable police officers and members of law enforcement who perpetrate violence murders and injustices—no matter what badge they wear.,2020-06-08 16:29:04,Twitter Web App,30,146
3⃣It establishes a federal police misconduct registry that is public and tracks complaints at the local state and federal level.   This increases accountability and transparency while ensuring past misconduct can be detected when an officer is trying to transfer departments.,2020-06-08 16:28:20,Twitter Web App,35,150
2⃣It finally classifies lynching as a federal hate crime in the United States. We know that this is long overdue but it is also urgently necessary today as we just witnessed the modern-day lynching of Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia.,2020-06-08 16:27:34,Twitter Web App,37,168
1⃣It not only bans chokeholds like the one used to murder George Floyd but it establishes them as a civil rights violation too.   It also bans no-knock warrants for drug cases like the one that was used when officers murdered Breonna Taylor shooting her at least eight times.,2020-06-08 16:26:52,Twitter Web App,37,188

This is an important step in the right direction.

🔵Keep paychecks coming.  🔵Keep workers with their benefits. 🔵Stop mass unemployment.

5⃣It meets the moment we're in with a solution that matches the scale of this crisis.   That's why it's supported by business owners labor leaders economists major groups across America—and the public.   There's no time to waste. We must pass the #PaycheckGuaranteeAct.,2020-05-09 20:09:03,Twitter Web App,12,44
4⃣It would cover more people for a longer period of time and for less money than we’ve spent on PPP.   More than 36 million workers would benefit. And a majority of the benefits would go to workers in the bottom two income quartiles—getting resources to those who need it most.,2020-05-09 20:07:21,Twitter Web App,14,50
3⃣It would keep businesses from closing for good while covering expenses like rent. And not just some businesses.   The program would support businesses and nonprofits of all sizes including small &amp; minority-owned businesses—the exact businesses that have been left behind by PPP.,2020-05-09 20:06:30,Twitter Web App,19,51
2⃣It would ensure workers can continue receiving health care benefits. If we fail to act it's estimated that up to 35 million Americans will lose their health coverage because of #COVID. (That's also why we need #MedicareForAll! Health care shouldn't be tied to employment.),2020-05-09 20:05:28,Twitter Web App,32,74
Here are5⃣reasons why we need the #PaycheckGuaranteeAct. Take a look and RT to agree.   1⃣It gets millions of workers who have lost their jobs off of unemployment and back on payroll—quickly getting direct support into the hands of workers. And it would be retroactive to March 1.,2020-05-09 20:04:26,Twitter Web App,109,202

More testing essential to get correct rates see what is before us &amp; get correct responses. Also must ensure we get tests into jails immigration detention ctrs &amp; poorest communities. #COVID19 doesn't discriminate. EVERYONE's health suffers if we don't take care of ALL. 9./,2020-03-15 22:33:34,Twitter Web App,14,67
To know what we are dealing with we need capacity to test everyone. We are making assumptions that you can only transmit if symptomatic but that is now in question according to researchers which makes it even more important to test everyone. 8./,2020-03-15 22:28:17,Twitter Web App,31,101
CDC restrictions on testing created bottleneck. But states have also had to triage testing until capacity increases which is what you are seeing now with saying the most vulnerable &amp; public health workers should be the ones tested.,2020-03-15 22:26:07,Twitter Web App,18,74
Then to 3rd factor: restrictions on testing. CDC started w/ severe restrictions on testing which was a huge mistake and partly due to limited kits and inability to process tests &amp; partly due to Trump's refusal to accept the science of #COVID19.  6./,2020-03-15 22:23:29,Twitter Web App,19,70
Then you get to 2nd factor which is lab capacity to process the tests. Meaningless to talk about # of tests available if they can't be processed. Lab capacity different in every single state &amp; we need commercial labs processing for more capacity.  5./,2020-03-15 22:21:54,Twitter Web App,23,62
But we still don't have enough actual tests at this moment. VP Pence announced today that 1.9 million tests will be available on Monday which will be critical progress if it happens. Remember too that each person requires 2-3 test samples. 4./,2020-03-15 22:19:15,Twitter Web App,29,108
Instead of using WHO test that was already developed CDC decided to develop our own.

To understand why testing is so limited here there are 3 factors: 1) the availability of tests; 2) the ability to process tests; and 3) the restrictions that have been placed on testing either from the federal or state levels. 2./,2020-03-15 22:10:05,Twitter Web App,34,98
THREAD on #COVID19 testing: Keep getting asked why testing is so limited in America versus what S. Korea &amp; others did. This is a good article that explains some of it. But here's my attempt to break it down more simply. https://t.co/iMtvTEJN4w  1./,2020-03-15 22:07:32,Twitter Web App,189,359
We need full testing of everyone not just those w/symptoms. B/c of limited testing capacity we're triaging. But studies showing you can transmit #COVID19 w/o symptoms. So must have full testing to know what the spread is &amp; how to respond. https://t.co/YIrxDczK4Y,2020-03-15 21:57:52,Twitter Web App,89,259

This shows clearly why we must take physical distancing (I prefer this term to social distancing) seriously. What we do matters in the spread of #coronavirus. Take a look at the simulations to fully understand.  https://t.co/51U2cRqKVe,2020-03-15 16:36:51,Twitter for iPhone,114,338

We must pay special attention to &amp; work to address the needs of hourly workers including domestic workers &amp; others who simply do not have any safety nets to help them through these difficult times. #COVIDー19,2020-03-14 05:21:54,Twitter Web App,52,212

#WA state is at the epicenter of the spread of #COVIDー19 &amp; desperately needs immediate help from the federal gov't.

We just passed the Families First #Coronavirus Response Act which includes enhanced unemployment insurance food assistance &amp; paid sick leave for working people &amp; families.

This is a huge win for immigrants public health AND everyone!  After I pressed Ken Cuccinelli earlier this week the Trump Admin has confirmed that its “public charge” rule does NOT apply to #COVIDー19-related care.

We can’t fight a pandemic if the 70+ million uninsured or underinsured Americans can’t afford to access care.

Trump’s “public charge” rule makes immigrants afraid of seeking medical care. It’s downright dangerous during a public emergency.
