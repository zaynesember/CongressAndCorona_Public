Thanks to the 2600 Minnesotans who spent their Thursday evening on the phone with me for bringing good ideas and thoughtful questions to our conversation. I’d say our first “Dial-In with Dean” was a success! #MN03 https://t.co/AOBSwedggw,2020-02-14 02:23:56,Twitter for iPhone,7,99

According to @adl research the horryfying increase in anti-Semitic violence isn’t due to changes in attitudes rather more of the millions of Americans holding such views are feeling emboldened to act on their hate.

It’s almost impossible to believe our Secretary of State would issue such an undignified and unprofessional statement attacking a reporter for doing her job. Our previous 44 presidents would have considered such behavior reprimandable but 45 probably gave him an “atta-boy”. https://t.co/VuDrMDB2on,2020-01-25 23:54:41,Twitter for iPhone,51,258

In its Citizens United ruling 10 years ago SCOTUS said that corporations are people and money is speech.
