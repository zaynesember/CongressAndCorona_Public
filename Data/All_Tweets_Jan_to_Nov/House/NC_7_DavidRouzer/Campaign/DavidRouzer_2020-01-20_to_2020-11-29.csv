Joined @teamtrump @NCGOP and others today in Wilmington to rally the troops and call out the lunacy of the far-left Democratic fringe on display this week at #DNC2020 — North Carolina is ready for four more years of President @realDonaldTrump! https://t.co/AP1aomln9Q,2020-08-20 23:57:01,Twitter for iPhone,7,18
The lunacy of the far-left fringe of the Democrat Party on display at #DNC2020 this week is astounding.   Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Bernie Sanders &amp; more parading to assure progressives Joe Biden is exactly what we fear: the bridge to a left-wing socialist agenda.,2020-08-19 23:05:09,TweetDeck,2,3
Honored to join @Mike_Pence today for trip to NC to visit @Thales_Academy -- with the dedication and creativity on display here we can and should reopen our schools in a way safe for students teachers and families.  https://t.co/PIsDB7uMIR,2020-07-29 17:44:24,TweetDeck,75,411

When @TeamPelosi says @VoteTimScott and other GOPers are "trying to get away with murder...the murder of George Floyd" she proves what everyone knows:  For Dems this is about scoring points in an election year — not about results that will make our communities safer.,2020-06-26 20:04:00,TweetDeck,2,2
Police Reform in Congress This Week:  Wednesday: Senate Dems block debate on @VoteTimScott's police reform bill.    Thursday: House Dems ram through partisan police overhaul w/ no GOP input.  For Dems this is about nothing more than election-year politics.,2020-06-26 17:43:59,TweetDeck,3,3

In 2017 President Trump and Republicans in Congress passed historic middle class tax relief. If Socialist Democrats take full control of Congress these tax cuts will be the first thing on the chopping block.   Your taxes will go up because of it and the economy will suffer too.,2020-06-18 01:14:00,TweetDeck,2,1
Medicare for All? $32 trillion.  Green New Deal? $93 trillion.   Progressive Wish List Touted as "COVID-19 Response Bill"? $3 trillion.   Who is going to pay for the Democrats' spending obsession?  Hardworking middle-class American families.   These are the stakes this November.,2020-06-17 22:24:17,TweetDeck,2,2
Left-wing socialists are now demanding what amounts to lunacy — defund our police officers.  It's just their latest idea to reshape America into their progressive vision.
