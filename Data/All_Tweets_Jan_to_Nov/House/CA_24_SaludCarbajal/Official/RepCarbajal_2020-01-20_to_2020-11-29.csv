Today marks 75 years since the liberation of Auschwitz and the end of the Holocaust.

Devastated to hear about Kobe Bryant his daughter Gianna and all on board.  On and off the court Kobe inspired.

A professor asked: Have I visited detention centers at the border?  Yes. Tornillo TX and Alamo Gordo NM. These facilities were not a place any of us would want children to be.

Received a question on impeachment and partisanship:  In the House we upheld our oath to defend the Constitution.  As they set the terms of the trial our U.S. Senators must put country over party. We need a fair trial we need witnesses and documents.,2020-01-22 02:57:45,Twitter for iPhone,11,53

Dark money has no place in our democracy. It’s past time to #EndCitizensUnited.  @HouseDemocrats are working to put power in the hands of the people.
