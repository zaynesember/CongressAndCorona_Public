Mr. Weissman’s @nytimes oped focuses on trump’s obstruction of justice.   Last week in a 🧵 I highlighted some of trump’s other crimes. 👇 https://t.co/hJcQPLEb2N,2020-11-28 21:06:04,Twitter for iPhone,55,191
As Mr. Weissman notes evidence of trump’s obstruction of justice is overwhelming — he openly admitted it.  If we fail to hold trump accountable our nation will barrel towards lawlessness and authoritarianism. https://t.co/AT0qASOvd7,2020-11-28 20:50:33,Twitter for iPhone,38,211

Mike flynn is a convicted felon. He confessed. He was on Putin’s payroll. The judge said flynn “sold your country out” and all but called him a traitor.   This is another abuse of the pardon power by trump and a damned disgrace. https://t.co/F0fYckLwne,2020-11-25 21:22:03,Twitter for iPhone,649,1991
I just want to note that trump pardons of corrupt aides or family members would themselves constitute obstruction of justice. A self-pardon would be illegal and unenforceable.

Trump’s campaign has stiffed 14 cities protecting his hate rallies out of $1.89 Million. Turns out trump is the one defunding police. El Paso should sue him.

Most Americans don’t know that @USPS receives effectively *no* support from the federal budget.  Forcing USPS to prefund its health care benefits at least *50 years in advance* accounts for almost all its losses since 2006. That's why USPS is in the red. https://t.co/wx8lF64uvF,2020-04-13 00:19:03,Twitter for iPhone,1135,2562
The post has been an agent of upward social mobility.
