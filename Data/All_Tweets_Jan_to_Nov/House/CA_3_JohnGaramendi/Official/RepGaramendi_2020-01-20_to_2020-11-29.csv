This index the Consumer Price Index for the Elderly (CPI-E) accurately reflects how retirees spend their money with a focus on healthcare and housing. It is a common-sense proposal that will allow for benefits to keep up with costs. https://t.co/MJQMslxNBY,2020-01-31 18:25:00,Twitter Web App,0,1

I will always work to protect and expand Social Security through my work in Congress. That's why I introduced the Fair COLA for Seniors Act which would ensure that Social Security works better for the people it serves. https://t.co/MJQMslxNBY,2020-01-31 18:24:59,Twitter Web App,0,1
