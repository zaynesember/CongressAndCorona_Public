A zillion must be a unit they use in political science labs!  Also who said the vaccine is more dangerous than the virus? I said if you’re under 30 and have fully recovered from a bout of COVID-19 it makes sense to get more data before getting the vaccine.

Why do some people insist that infection and subsequent recovery from this virus doesn’t leave most people with a high level of immunity?    Because as soon as you develop the immunity all of their reasons for stripping away your freedom go away.  https://t.co/ahcJ5qXHIa,2020-11-28 14:44:04,Twitter for iPhone,1330,4293

Someone has plans to make the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine mandatory. There’s no other reason to explain why they are testing it on children right now.

@SeeTheShitShow The loose use of language in the article demonstrates the author is misinformed or seeking to misinform. Patents aren’t “extended.” New patents are issued.

@helaire Sorta.  I’m just saying look at the data (second picture) compared to the models (first picture). They don’t line up and so we should be suspect of the data reported from various countries.

If a country succeeds in changing the spreading rate of a virus the amplitude of the curve will change but the TIMING and WIDTH of the curve should change as well.

I’d say it’s some of both but if we look at the increased cases in North Carolina (which started increasing well before FL &amp; TX) they haven’t resulted in comensurate increases in deaths.

A question being debated is to what degree “new cases” in Florida and Texas will translate into “new deaths.” Here’s the graph of deaths and the graph of cases for NY FL TX.

Destroying people’s jobs will cause suffering worse than COVID-19. People who are jobless for months will find it difficult to pay for food housing and medicine.

The price increase is a signal to low risk areas to ship their masks to high risk areas.  Banning commerce in necessary goods will cause immeasurable suffering.

Shouldn’t the Democrats in the Senate who are running against President @realDonaldTrump for president in 2020 recuse themselves from the #impeachment vote?

@Charles_Benoit Don’t get me wrong the solar slates are beautiful! IMHO The best way to solar a new roof is to do what I did on my south facing roof: install standing seam metal and use S5! clamps to attach large format solar panels to the standing seams. No holes in roof and easy to work on.,2020-01-27 01:51:49,Twitter for iPhone,1,5
@Charles_Benoit Solar slates (v 1.0?) were available when I did this roof.  They didn’t make sense then and they (v 3.0) don’t make sense now for the same reasons. 8000 slates = 16000 electrical connections in the field.  Also how do you replace a single slate?
