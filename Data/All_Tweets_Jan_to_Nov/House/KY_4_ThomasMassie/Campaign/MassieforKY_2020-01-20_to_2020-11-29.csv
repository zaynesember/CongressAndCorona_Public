Fact Check: "I'm sure that I've raised more $ from Kentuckians than he has"- Todd McMurtry   🔥❌False  ☑️We've raised more than 2.5X as much from Kentucky than McMurtry in 2020 Race  ☑️Raised more than McMurtry has from Kentucky even including his $135000 loan to his campaign https://t.co/ahOLopSyu3,2020-06-19 18:39:48,Twitter Web App,1,8
It’s a shame an outside group from Texas is on the air today with $124000 in ads wasting so much of their donor’s hard-earned money propping up McMurtry’s broke campaign.
