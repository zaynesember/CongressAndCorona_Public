The fact that Democrats are suing to challenge voters’ rights to observe votes being counted raises serious concerns about their commitment to a fair and transparent process. (2/2),2020-11-05 19:53:16,Twitter Web App,2,3
We must ensure that every legal vote is counted and every illegal ballot is rejected. This must be a transparent process with poll watchers allowed access to the canvassing of ballots especially in places like Philadelphia where there have been allegations of fraud.

Looking forward to joining President @realDonaldTrump in Allentown today to highlight the work his Administration and partners in Congress are doing to defeat this virus and get Pennsylvanians back to work quickly and safely! https://t.co/RTkTcUBPab,2020-05-14 13:51:12,Twitter for iPhone,1,3
Safely we can reopen practicing the CDC guidelines. This is an important point: the small businesses medium and largest businesses and their employees are very smart. We can do this safely. https://t.co/TaRNq4vkNd,2020-05-13 13:26:39,Twitter for iPhone,0,4
Trying to feed your family is not "cowardly." Despite what Governor Wolf believes Pennsylvania’s small business owners and workers are smart enough to operate safely and feed their families. https://t.co/l8NhZSIJTK,2020-05-11 18:31:00,Twitter for iPhone,3,1
Shameful tactics from California Democrats opening up a Democrat-heavy voting precinct for in-person voting at the last minute because @MikeGarcia2020 is ahead. Dems are changing the rules to steal the election from CA voters. Send Mike help here: https://t.co/8Twi04Y5oz https://t.co/gUGHQWBmbH,2020-05-09 17:49:49,Twitter for iPhone,2,3

Last week I introduced the Federal Prisons Accountability Act to bring oversight and transparency to the Bureau of Prisons. The American public expects their government to be accountable to them. It’s time we hold BOP to that basic standard. https://t.co/xd92rT17ei,2020-05-04 14:04:07,Twitter for iPhone,1,2
Earlier this week my friend and House Republican Whip @SteveScaliseGOP joined me for a discussion with #PA12 residents.

.@ChristyforCA25’s shameful attack on @MikeGarcia2020’s selfless service to our country crosses the line. To help stop the divisive politics embodied by @TeamPelosi and her handpicked candidate I donated to Mike Garcia’s campaign. I hope you will too: https://t.co/yuCkglJkZB https://t.co/8qrZlfiGMW,2020-04-28 20:41:49,Twitter for iPhone,11,15
It was great to have House Republican Whip @SteveScaliseGOP join me and thousands of #PA12 residents yesterday for a tele-town hall to discuss the federal response to COVID-19 and the need to re-open Pennsylvania safely and quickly. https://t.co/FUu8PaSi2u,2020-04-28 12:13:13,Twitter for iPhone,1,3

The Paycheck Protection Program has been a lifeline for tens of thousands of small businesses across Pennsylvania. Speaker Pelosi and Senator Schumer should stop blocking funds and get to work to help the hardworking Americans who need it NOW! https://t.co/ttYvrJO2Mt,2020-04-16 17:18:23,Twitter for iPhone,1,2

In order to protect our corrections officers and the greater community all inmate movement into Pennsylvania's federal Bureau of Prisons facilities must be stopped immediately.

Senator Schumer’s dangerous rhetoric threatening two Supreme Court Justices has no place in American politics. These unhinged actions are sadly becoming more and more typical of the radical socialist left. https://t.co/PCQpRgRW0E,2020-03-05 14:14:22,Twitter for iPhone,0,2
On any given day #PA12 produces up to 10 percent of the nation’s natural gas. Socialist Democrats’ calls to ban fracking would devastate our economy and destroy thousands of good-paying jobs. We won’t let this happen! https://t.co/aYa5DSz6UW,2020-03-02 14:38:59,Twitter for iPhone,0,2

Mike Bloomberg could not even change a tire on his car let alone deal with the myriad of issues farmers deal with on a daily basis.
