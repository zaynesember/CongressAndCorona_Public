I co-sponsored the #NoBanAct to stop any prior or future discriminatory bans on people of specific national origin or religion. Our country must continue to be a beacon of hope and we must recommit ourselves to our nation’s core value of religious freedom,2020-01-28 21:15:17,Twitter for iPhone,4,4
America’s strength comes from its diversity – we cannot now or EVER tolerate the xenophobia and hatred promoted by President Trump’s #MuslimBan that was issued three years ago this week.,2020-01-28 21:14:56,Twitter for iPhone,5,8
Fewer than half the American workforce does not have access to #paidleave despite the fact that these programs are good for employees employers and the economy. @WaysMeansCmte Dems are talking about this issue in Committee today.

Public support for #paidleave isn’t just limited to time off for the birth of a new baby.   Over 80% of Americans favor comprehensive &amp; inclusive proposals that include leave for ALL serious family and medical needs. https://t.co/YEkyZ7hnmB,2020-01-28 16:16:46,TweetDeck,10,20

After the #2010Census Nevada received more than $6 billion in federal funding per year and gained a seat in the House of Representatives. We must ensure an accurate #2020Census so our state receives the funding and representation it deserves in this decade. https://t.co/H9QBpFScsl,2020-01-24 21:51:32,Twitter for iPhone,17,30
The @USCensusBureau is looking to hire 10000 Nevadans who can help ensure that our state has an accurate #2020Census count. Yesterday my office hosted a job fair to spread the word.

The #2020Census will be available in a VARIETY of languages. Every person in this country will have an opportunity to #StandUp and #BeCounted no matter what language they speak.

The #2020Census is SAFE and SECURE. By law the U.S. Census Bureau cannot release any information to ANY AGENCY that identifies you. Data collected by the @USCensusBureau will ONLY be used for statistical data that will help our government make important decisions.,2020-01-24 01:14:49,Twitter for iPhone,2,2
Will you pledge to #BeCounted in the #2020Census? Households in #Nevada will begin receiving invitations to participate in the #Census in March.

Data from the #2010Census was used to allocate more than $6 billion in federal funding for our state. At that time Nevada was recorded as one of the fastest-growing states in the country. We MUST ensure an accurate count in the #2020Census for the future of our state. https://t.co/mt7PdyXGOL,2020-01-24 01:14:04,Twitter for iPhone,0,0
Last night I hosted a #townhall to inform the people of Nevada’s Fourth Congressional District about the upcoming #2020Census.

It is wrong for the U.S. to force a #HealthCare provider in another country to choose between providing comprehensive care to patients and keeping critical funding. Doctors pledge to do no harm. Repeal the #GlobalGagRule join me in supporting the #GlobalHERAct. https://t.co/2FHmo6nYZ2,2020-01-23 22:50:26,Twitter for iPhone,1,2
Three years ago today President Trump reinstalled the #GlobalGagRule. By forcing providers to withhold info about legal health services the #GlobalGagRule violates the trusted relationship between a woman and her provider. I support the #GlobalHERAct to #EndGlobalGag. https://t.co/uHvynyfrUG,2020-01-23 22:50:05,Twitter for iPhone,6,12

If the #ACA is repealed 371000 Nevadans would lose coverage and 1.2 million Nevadans with private health coverage would lose guaranteed access to free preventative care like immunizations and cancer screenings.   #SCOTUS must not leave these lives in the balance. https://t.co/s3sBPDVFY0,2020-01-22 00:29:29,TweetDeck,3,7
