#SmallBusinessSaturday is today and I hope you will consider buying something in your community this weekend across AR-1. Our small businesses have struggled this year and for many 50% of their sales come this time of the year. Let’s spend locally if you can/are able! 🎅🏼🤶🏻🎄🎁,2020-11-28 15:20:31,Twitter for iPhone,4,16
American traditions are what make us great like Thanksgiving. But in America we are fighting against social media platforms who want to start a new “tradition” - censorship. No longer is this being watchful against foreign nations. It’s censoring our very own! #EndSec230 https://t.co/fCVWGwcTG4,2020-11-27 15:34:48,Twitter for iPhone,10,21
There is no doubt that food brings us together and the dinner table is a place of many laughs and heartfelt conversations. This year might look a little different but there is always a lot to be grateful for no matter how you celebrate. From my table to yours Happy Thanksgiving. https://t.co/hV0qvQq223,2020-11-26 17:43:52,Twitter for iPhone,1,9
For today’s Thanksgiving food fact did you about 3 billion pounds of sweet potatoes are produced in the US each year? That’s about $706 million for our farmers and producers! Your Thanksgiving meal might taste great but it also does great things for the nation’s economy too. #Ag https://t.co/tSQOIhdLh3,2020-11-26 17:27:42,Twitter for iPhone,2,13
There are certain inalienable rights endowed to us by our Creator and within those rights is the protection of our religious beliefs. Even in a pandemic the Constitution preserves the rights of every American citizen. https://t.co/tS6i34u3j8,2020-11-26 16:39:57,Twitter for iPhone,198,761
This Thanksgiving will likely be different for many across the First District. We’ve all endured so much this year in ways we never thought imaginable.

Congratulations to @GenFlynn and his pardon for the crimes he never committed that were conceived by then-President Obama and Vice President Biden and their cadre of supporters.

For today’s Thanksgiving food fact did you know that about 50 million pumpkin pies are consumed each Thanksgiving? About 1.6 billion pounds of pumpkin are produced in preparation for Thanksgiving. That’s more than $207 million for American producers! #Agriculture #Thanksgiving https://t.co/ZclgEFomSm,2020-11-25 20:05:19,Twitter for iPhone,5,10

Cranberries are a traditional side dish for a Thanksgiving meal. But did you know that Americans consume enough cranberries to fill 8 Olympic-sized pools? #agriculture #Thanksgiving https://t.co/X6b1n7fcvv,2020-11-24 21:09:25,Twitter for iPhone,3,2
What reporter in the establishment media will be courageous enough to ask Joe Biden about this and demand an answer like they have President Trump the last four years on a myriad of topics? Probably less than five and that may be optimistic. https://t.co/8y1CGLWpzt,2020-11-24 21:08:47,Twitter for iPhone,2,3
When a nation - any nation - forsakes their food security it’s forsaking their *national* security. The global threats to our food and fiber supply are significant. Any administration who isn’t taking that serious is not serious about protecting American families. https://t.co/tIfSu8wzmF,2020-11-24 20:44:27,Twitter for iPhone,3,13
Pelosi is ensuring President Trump has as little impact on helping American families as possible. She wouldn’t pass a bill before the election and she continues to stall. It’s clear she’s driven by her politics not the needs of the people. https://t.co/N1WnUUgbqA,2020-11-24 17:01:22,Twitter for iPhone,5,13

As we gear up for Thanksgiving I thought it’d be fun to highlight some fun Thanksgiving food facts this week. Let’s start with the main course. Did you know that Arkansas is the 3rd largest turkey producing state in the US? #Thanksgiving #agriculture https://t.co/ax0HkESojW,2020-11-23 20:22:57,Twitter for iPhone,3,13
As we enter a week of Thanksgiving and appreciation it is great to see another company with a vaccine candidate with high effectiveness.

Even with the significant and complete whitewashing of the election by the MSM almost fifty percent (!!) of Americans distrust the election results. This is why we must have transparency and full-faith efforts/audits on the results. Why isn’t Joe Biden asking for this? https://t.co/NmliwzDUT9,2020-11-21 14:59:47,Twitter for iPhone,2,19

How many times did Joe Biden walk away from a press conference over the last several months after not taking questions and get this reaction?  How many times did the establishment media put it out all over social media like they are now?  It’s a really easy answer.... zero. https://t.co/FJjw4JvFnk,2020-11-19 23:48:11,Twitter for iPhone,10,28

Hybrid hearings have been a failed experiment. We cannot conduct oversight if we can’t talk with witnesses. @AMTRAK is asking the taxpayers for billions of dollars and @TransportGOP can’t ask its COO basic questions about its plans. https://t.co/rCYi3DJFco,2020-11-18 19:09:30,Twitter Web App,6,14

There aren’t enough tweets to show how the MSM did all they could to downplay/dismiss the assertion by the President we would have a vaccine by year-end.

Well that’s an interesting word choice. We’ve moved from “widespread” to “significant”.  With widespread reports - including Arkansas - of ballot fraud and/or irregularities it would seem the MSM is still trying to whitewash the voices of 70 million Americans from this election https://t.co/ouF8q6qUmu,2020-11-17 17:11:35,Twitter for iPhone,9,25
“Voter fraud isn’t widespread” they say. “It doesn’t happen enough to change elections” they’ve clamored. Well the two state representatives in Arkansas who are in the middle of this may have a different opinion as well as those who voted. https://t.co/r4Kh4C0ZTa,2020-11-17 02:44:00,Twitter for iPhone,231,376
Reports of a second successful vaccine for COVID shows yet again that Operation Warp Speed is a resounding success.

Pelosi is refusing to denounce socialism which is a forgone conclusion at this point. She hasn’t said a word about the massive allegations of fraud and irregularities. Delegitimizing elections are the start of socialist regimes. It’s clear what she supports.,2020-11-10 15:42:39,Twitter for iPhone,19,86

Its not the media who decide elections. Neither the punditry who demand someone concedes. It’s the U.S. Constitution that affords Americans the right to vote and a system to ensure that we have free and fair elections. Abdicating those means abdicating the Republic. #transparency,2020-11-07 21:58:43,Twitter for iPhone,86,247
Fighting tooth and nail against transparency and openness are not the hallmarks of people who believe in free and fair elections.

Illegal ballots and voter fraud doesn’t have to be “widespread” for it to still occur and change/alter election outcomes.
