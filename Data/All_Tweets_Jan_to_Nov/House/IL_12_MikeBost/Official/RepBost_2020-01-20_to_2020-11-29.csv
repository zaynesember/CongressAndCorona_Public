Yesterday @HouseVetAffairs held a hearing to look at how the VA is supporting survivors of military sexual assault. We cannot put our heads in the sand and ignore this issue – we must address it and do it correctly because the longer we wait the longer victims suffer. https://t.co/RsAd8Z37rF,2020-02-06 22:32:03,Twitter Web App,3,33
Not only did Speaker Pelosi intentionally disrespect @POTUS by ripping up his speech she insulted the Americans whose inspiring stories were included in those pages. Her actions reflected poorly on the entire House and deserved a rebuke by her colleagues. I voted to do so today. https://t.co/CR053CCEko,2020-02-06 19:21:17,Twitter Web App,21,78

There’s a big difference though @nathanlgonzales: I protested the Democrat majority in IL giving us mere minutes to review a 200 page pension reform bill before voting on it. Speaker Pelosi deliberately tried to insult the leader of our country behind his back on national TV. https://t.co/mCYADLPYAw,2020-02-05 17:07:38,Twitter Web App,7,44

Not even a month after Iran launched an attack on US troops Dems voted to limit @POTUS's ability to keep our nation safe by blocking him from taking action against Iran even if intelligence shows an attack on the US or our allies is imminent. I voted NO on tying POTUS's hands.,2020-01-30 19:03:14,Twitter Web App,11,41
It’s devastating to lose a vet who didn’t know where to turn for help. It’s even more inexcusable when this happens inside of a VA facility.

Last night on #HolocaustRemembranceDay the House voted on the Never Again Education Act a bill I was proud to cosponsor &amp; vote for.
