Police reform doesn't have to be anti-police. We can encourage positive policing without hamstringing our police's ability to do their job. The #JUSTICEAct shows that.  But Sen. Schumer walks away and Speaker Pelosi says that GOP is trying to get away with murder. It's sickening.,2020-06-25 19:56:18,Twitter Web App,6,18
Congress can't have an honest debate on police reform if one side just gets up and walks away. @SenatorTimScott deserves better for his efforts on the #JUSTICEAct.

Demoralizing really.   Senator Schumer had the chance to find common ground with Republicans on police reform.
