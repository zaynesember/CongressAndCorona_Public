Stone lied to federal investigators &amp; intimidated witnesses to protect Trump. And he said he should be rewarded with a commutation for not turning on him.

Proud to work w/ @RepSteveStivers to pass the #PAWS4VetsTherapy Act to provide veterans with the opportunity to work with service dogs.  By reducing the symptoms of PTSD service dogs help save lives. And with 20 veterans dying every day by suicide this bill will do just that. https://t.co/PQQaiC8QIK,2020-02-06 22:17:55,Twitter Web App,4,23

An acquittal without a fair trial is no acquittal at all – it’s a cover-up. As a career prosecutor who spent decades in the courtroom I’m stunned at this tragic distortion of our justice system and I fear the dangerous precedent it sets.   https://t.co/z2oceG0OdL,2020-02-05 21:40:40,Twitter Web App,20,65
My @NewDemCoalition colleagues and I urged the President to drop the divisive rhetoric &amp; focus on issues that matter to the American people - like infrastructure and health care - during #SOTU2020.

By blocking witnesses and documents @senatemajldr &amp; Senate Republicans have abandoned their constitutional duty to act as impartial jurors. This is a disgrace.,2020-01-31 23:21:49,Twitter for iPhone,40,154
Did you know the IRS Volunteer Income Tax Assistance program provides free tax return preparation services to households with a yearly income of $56000 or less?  Appointments at locations on Long Island are starting next week! ⬇️ https://t.co/bfI27VqAbq,2020-01-31 16:25:51,Twitter Web App,6,9
Proud to join @RepRichHudson to introduce this bipartisan legislation. We must make sure our veterans – and those who care for them – receive the benefits services and comprehensive support that they deserve. https://t.co/BFRVGrCCkz,2020-01-30 16:12:27,Twitter Web App,5,22
In November I held a hearing exposing the dangers and injustices of the Trump Administration’s #RemainInMexico policy.   The policy is still hurting migrant families &amp; asylum seekers to this day. We must end it immediately. https://t.co/DYq67wKcaB,2020-01-29 18:14:58,Twitter Web App,15,29
I'm pleased the President signed @HomelandDems’ bill into law to increase funding for the Nonprofit Security Grant Program.   Last year Jewish organizations synagogues &amp; schools in #NY04 received $1.7m in funding through this life-saving program.⬇️ https://t.co/jBnGc2w4Zn.,2020-01-28 19:00:20,Twitter Web App,3,7
I’m proud to cosponsor the Horseracing Integrity Act to finally ban doping in American horseracing and stop the ongoing abuse of these animals.

Proud the House has passed the “Never Again Education Act” – a bill I cosponsored to strengthen Holocaust education efforts in America.   Educating future generations on the evils of bigotry is the best way to keep history from repeating itself. #HolocaustRemembranceDay,2020-01-28 00:45:34,Twitter for iPhone,5,29
On #HolocaustRemembranceDay #WeRemember the millions of lives lost in this horrific chapter of history.   We must listen to the stories of survivors. Because only by remembering can we prevent something like this from happening again.   https://t.co/T6KEQ0raOK,2020-01-27 15:46:20,Twitter for iPhone,6,28
Any proper trial includes relevant witnesses and documents. The House managers made a powerful case this week and the public agrees. The Senate owes it to the American people to hold a fair trial.    https://t.co/kCYbLO0zKE,2020-01-25 16:54:24,Twitter for iPhone,6,45
We need action to hold polluters accountable. That’s why I’m supporting the Energy Innovation &amp; Carbon Dividend Act a bipartisan #climatechange bill that will reduce our carbon emissions by 90% by 2050.  https://t.co/brHudyQDSl,2020-01-24 18:42:41,Twitter Web App,21,81
Communities across the country - including several on Long Island – are facing pressing water contamination issues yet the Trump Administration is stripping clean water protections.

The President’s #GlobalGagRule makes it significantly harder for women and girls around the world to access reproductive healthcare.   We need to pass the #GlobalHERAct and put an immediate end to this harmful policy.,2020-01-23 17:04:38,Twitter Web App,5,17
#RoevWade is clear - women are entitled to make their own reproductive choices. Yet even on the 47th anniversary of the ruling there are still those trying to take us backwards.   We must fight back against attempts to undermine women's reproductive rights.,2020-01-22 16:54:31,Twitter Web App,11,35
10 years ago today the Supreme Court’s controversial Citizens United ruling opened the floodgates for big money in our elections.   Let’s pass the #DemocracyForAll amendment and #EndCitzensUnited once and for all. https://t.co/IZbiiiYbJB,2020-01-21 18:08:05,Twitter Web App,18,42
The Senate must carry out its constitutional duty to hold a fair impeachment trial.   A “trial” without witnesses and documents is not a trial at all – it’s a sham. Do the right thing @senatemajldr.,2020-01-21 15:09:17,Twitter for iPhone,12,43
We’ve come a long way but we’re still far from realizing #MLK’s vision of a completely equal society.  Proud to be here at the Long Beach MLK Center today as we remember Dr. King and vow to continue the fight for equality. https://t.co/CSChB8PySo,2020-01-20 19:29:23,Twitter for iPhone,3,17
