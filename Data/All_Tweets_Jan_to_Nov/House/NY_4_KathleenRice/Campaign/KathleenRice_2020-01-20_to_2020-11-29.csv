There's no doubt that @JoeBiden can defeat Donald Trump in November. And I know he'll restore integrity decency and strong leadership to the White House. Joe supported me when I first ran for Congress and I'm proud to support him in the most important election of our lifetime.,2020-03-04 20:38:12,Twitter for iPhone,7,27
