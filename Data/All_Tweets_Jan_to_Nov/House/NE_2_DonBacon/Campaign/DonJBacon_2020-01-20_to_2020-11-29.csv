My opponent keeps playing the victim card about outside groups opposing her. It is hypocrisy. Outside groups spent $5.6M supporting her to include AOC spending $350K last week alone.

Ballot harvesting by campaigns is illegal in NE. A taped video shows two violations by Eastman’s team.

My opponent can’t fathom why 24 labor unions endorsed or provided maximum support to me.

Kara Eastman just said we must put America first.  President Trump and I agree! That's why we're pushing for free and fair trade to bring American jobs back. Strangely you keep attacking us for it.,2020-10-18 23:32:52,Twitter Web App,11,29
Time after time in this debate my opponent responds to her questions by attacking the President attacking Republicans and attacking me. Sure seems bipartisan to me!,2020-10-18 23:31:50,Twitter Web App,13,35
My opponent just said "as long as we have workers Social Security won't be insolvent."   Kara I know math is hard but we have more people retiring than entering the workforce. Hence the shortfall and insolvency unless we act.,2020-10-18 23:30:33,Twitter Web App,15,24
We need to STRENGTHEN Social Security.   But if we do nothing automatic 25% cuts are coming.   We absolutely must protect Social Security period.,2020-10-18 23:28:30,Twitter Web App,9,16
We all want to ensure we have affordable &amp; accessible healthcare.  Kara's plan will raise federal spending by 70% meaning your taxes will go up by 70%.  Kara's plan puts politicians and DC bureaucrats in charge of our families' healthcare decisions. Kara's plan is a nightmare.,2020-10-18 23:26:29,Twitter Web App,9,26
Kara's policies = Bernie's policies  She continues to run from her radical left views but it's a failing effort.  She wont even use the words "Medicare for All" in this debate.,2020-10-18 23:24:21,Twitter Web App,12,18
My bill covered pre-existing conditions three different ways. Doesn't matter what Kara Eastman says in this debate or to all the coastal folks who follow her on social media. I staunchly support guaranteed coverage for pre-existing conditions.,2020-10-18 23:22:45,Twitter Web App,10,18
The question: What's your plan to make healthcare more affordable?  My opponent is flat out lying now about my healthcare record and my past votes. And while she's lying she's refusing to actually answer any questions.   Simply amazing.,2020-10-18 23:21:12,Twitter Web App,8,16
Kara Eastman's attempts to make me seem like a psychic who can predict pandemics are falling flat. It's funny that she thinks this is effective actually.  Leadership thinking ahead &amp; proper planning... that's why my bill passed allowing masks to be mass produced during COVID.,2020-10-18 23:18:50,Twitter Web App,9,18
Kara thinks I had a crystal ball and knew COVID was coming.  No Kara. It's called leadership and the ability to look forward. I spent three decades in the military doing this... no crystal ball needed.,2020-10-18 23:16:22,Twitter Web App,11,25
Question: What should Congress do to ensure rural hospitals continue to operate?  My opponent's plan would result in the CLOSURE of 30+ rural hospitals in Nebraska. Even Democrats agree that Kara's healthcare plan would devastate Nebraska healthcare.,2020-10-18 23:14:06,Twitter Web App,13,17
The HEROES Act was a far-left wish list: releasing felons from prison early defunding police and more. It was disguised as a COVID relief bill and Kara Eastman supports it.  She doesn't support the true bipartisan COVID relief framework we built in the Problem Solvers Caucus.,2020-10-18 23:12:51,Twitter Web App,10,18
88% of our #smallbiz took assistance from the CARES Act but my opponent called it a "corporate heist."  CARES Act saved 51 million jobs but my opponent called it a "corporate heist."  I'm proud to have supported the CARES Act despite the constant criticisms from Kara Eastman.,2020-10-18 23:09:20,Twitter Web App,8,19
In other words she's saying people need help now and the Democrats under Speaker Pelosi need to act.  At least I think that's what she's saying... she's touched on about six different topics in this response. https://t.co/myP4rwvN0M,2020-10-18 23:07:04,Twitter Web App,9,17
First question is about COVID and how to help those in need. My opponent says her plan is Joe Biden's plan and that she doesn't agree with her party.,2020-10-18 23:05:29,Twitter Web App,9,20
In her opening statement Kara Eastman said she would be an independent voice. That must be why she only supports radical left policy positions like the job-killing Green New Deal massive government takeover of healthcare tax increases on EVERYONE and more.,2020-10-18 23:04:02,Twitter Web App,11,26

Last week my opponent slandered our law enforcement saying they “were the #5 cause of death for black men.” She then corrected it to #6.

In Q3 Kara Eastman raised 47% of her contributions from NY and CA and only 19% from NE. In 2020 a total of 45% of all her $$ came from CA and NY. In contrast 53% of my contributions come from NE.

I'm grateful to all for such generous support!   Im sure Eastman is grateful to NY &amp; CA because 47% of her individual donations came from those states.

The choice is clear: huge bloated government and high taxes or preserving our freedoms and local control. Thanks for your support!,2020-10-13 00:03:30,Twitter Web App,7,28
Kara Eastman just said half our country is on fire or under water. These are the same kinds of exaggerations we see from AOC and Bernie Sanders.   If that much of America really is on fire perhaps it's because my opponent and those who support her want to defund law enforcement.,2020-10-12 23:57:32,Twitter Web App,8,41
Our elections in Nebraska are safe and secure. Voting by mail is safe here. But Kara Eastman supports policies that would give bureaucrats in Washington DC control over our elections. That's not right.,2020-10-12 23:56:17,Twitter Web App,3,14
America today is the largest energy producer in the world. We've cut emissions more than the next 12 countries combined.   My opponent says that's bad. She wants to ban cows and air travel instead.,2020-10-12 23:51:54,Twitter Web App,4,9
We also need to ensure we strengthen border security to stop the human and drug trafficking and prevent illegal border crossings. It isn't fair to those who followed the rules and came to the US legally.,2020-10-12 23:49:54,Twitter Web App,2,3
Kara says her field director is a DACA recipient. I'm proud to have fought for DACA at a time when it was very unpopular in my party. Yet another example of my bipartisanship.,2020-10-12 23:48:11,Twitter Web App,9,20
Kara says I'm trying to paint her as someone she isn't.

When hyperpartisan bills like the majority of what Speaker Pelosi introduces come for a vote... Of course I'll vote against them. They don't represent our district.

Most people would like to see their premiums reduced by 20%. Republicans and Democrats alike want to protect pre-existing condition coverage. So let's do it - WITHOUT DESTROYING HEALTHCARE like my opponent would do.,2020-10-12 23:30:24,Twitter Web App,4,6
My healthcare plan has been well reported including by OWH. We need more competition more transparency and lower costs. People should have freedom to find the plan they like and pay a reasonable cost for it. My opponent wants a one-size-fits-all plan &amp; HIGH taxes.,2020-10-12 23:28:07,Twitter Web App,5,9
So many people today are paying $20000+ in premiums and they used to pay $5000. Costs are too high. So let's fix healthcare not destroy it. And my opponent's plan will absolutely DESTROY healthcare.,2020-10-12 23:26:08,Twitter Web App,6,8
Kara says "Medicare for All means different things to different people." and that it gives "freedom to choose your provider."

It will take several factors to come up with the solution to Social Security. This will take a bipartisan effort but Speaker Pelosi doesn't want to touch it. It's time to retake the House so we can solve this problem and strengthen Social Security.,2020-10-12 23:15:15,Twitter Web App,2,3
Kara says: "Joe Biden and I have a little bit of a difference of opinion on healthcare."  No Kara. Joe Biden said we couldn't pay for your healthcare plan and that he would veto it. Period.,2020-10-12 23:13:20,Twitter Web App,6,13

Kara Eastman called the CARES Act a "corporate heist"... this is the same bill that saved 51 million jobs and provided resources to 88% of #smallbiz.

The question: what help should Congress provide to help people overcome COVID?  Kara: Don Bacon voted against the Heroes Act.

Thank you to everyone who tuned into this debate! Once again we saw my opponent latch onto her hyperpartisan policies while pretending to be a moderate.   Another notch in the win column! Two more debates and a forum within the next ten days. Looking forward to them!,2020-10-08 18:04:02,Twitter Web App,7,11
I've delivered bipartisan results. I'm the co-chair of FIVE bipartisan caucuses. I'm rated in the top 7% of the House for bipartisanship by Georgetown University. I could go on.  My opponent has made it clear she only supports the most hyperpartisan bills out there.,2020-10-08 18:02:11,Twitter Web App,15,23

Kara Eastman continues to try to moderate her positions. It isn't working. Why? Because she's been publicly promoting policies out of Bernie Sanders' and AOC's playbook for three years.,2020-10-08 17:54:58,Twitter Web App,6,9
Kara just said things shouldn't be free.  Flip flop?  Free healthcare free college the list goes on. It's even on her website.,2020-10-08 17:53:50,Twitter Web App,4,9
NOTHING IS FREE despite what my opponent says. Eastman continues to push "free" this and "free" that but these are tax dollars she's talking about.  And she said last night she's the real fiscal conservative in this race.,2020-10-08 17:52:42,Twitter Web App,6,11

Kara Eastman once again talking about how she refuses corporate PAC money.   Once again I'll remind everyone that Eastman takes TONS of corporate PAC dollars. In fact those dollars are paying for her TV ads. $667000 in corporate PAC money this week alone.,2020-10-08 17:51:32,Twitter Web App,5,9
Voting by mail is safe and secure in Nebraska.   My opponent supports a federal takeover of elections and TAXPAYER FUNDING of political campaigns. Do you want your tax dollars supporting a candidate you disagree with?,2020-10-08 17:50:01,Twitter Web App,7,14

We're the largest energy-producing nation in the world today the first time since 1949 we're exporting energy and we've cut emissions more than the next 12 countries combined.  Kara Eastman supports the Green New Deal and the $90 TRILLION price tag it comes with.,2020-10-08 17:44:51,Twitter Web App,3,4
My opponent keeps talking about supporting bills. Why then does she only bring up the hyperpartisan bills? Why never the bills that had bipartisan input?,2020-10-08 17:43:37,Twitter Web App,4,5
Kara is talking about #smallbiz and said they're the fabric of our community.  I agree. Small biz is also the backbone of our economy. I'm grateful to have endorsement from NFIB the nation's largest smallbiz association.,2020-10-08 17:43:04,Twitter Web App,3,6
DC shouldn't be telling us how to run our elections. We're doing it right. But that's included in the Heroes Act that Kara Eastman supports. Why doesn't Eastman support Nebraska's election system?,2020-10-08 17:41:46,Twitter Web App,4,6
The Heroes Act is a dreadful bill nothing but a far-left wish list disguised as COVID relief. It let felons out of prison early defunded police and more.  Pelosi won't consider the bipartisan COVID relief framework I helped write. Why? Because it isn't her wishlist.,2020-10-08 17:40:43,Twitter Web App,3,6

Kara Eastman just called healthcare for veterans "socialized medicine." Sorry Kara but veterans have EARNED that healthcare. It's employer-provided.,2020-10-08 17:25:30,Twitter Web App,18,55
Kara Eastman and her supporters repeatedly say they want the military healthcare but don't want to serve a day in uniform.  THIS IS WRONG. I had four combat deployments and served three decades.,2020-10-08 17:23:00,Twitter Web App,8,22
Let me repeat that... The NDP said Kleine's actions perpetuated white supremacy and some of Kara Eastman's staff helped with that resolution. Her silence here is deafening. https://t.co/GsPL0TcrWe,2020-10-08 17:20:48,Twitter Web App,3,7
I asked Kara if she would condemn the Nebraska Democrat Party's slanderous attacks on Don Kleine.   She refused to give an answer. She apparently supports the NDP's horrendous comments about a dedicated public servant.,2020-10-08 17:18:36,Twitter Web App,5,14
The Congressional Budget Office said my healthcare plan would reduce premiums by 20%.   The same office said Kara's plan would devastate medical research and development.,2020-10-08 17:17:11,Twitter Web App,4,8
Kara Eastman continues to try to tie herself to Joe Biden. The problem is Joe Biden said he would veto her healthcare plan.,2020-10-08 17:15:43,Twitter Web App,3,6

Are you ready to have your overall taxes increased by 70%? That's my opponent's vision.,2020-10-08 17:11:52,Twitter Web App,9,47
Kara Eastman said she wants to expand healthcare. Sure if her definition of "expand" is to kick 180 MILLION people off their employer and union provided plans.,2020-10-08 17:10:06,Twitter Web App,5,13
The COVID vaccine was already funded. My opponent criticized the CARES Act.,2020-10-08 17:08:55,Twitter Web App,4,3
The question was about what federal action should be taken to reduce the spread of COVID. Kara Eastman spent her 90 seconds saying masks work and Trump is bad. No plan. Not surprising considering she spent weeks attacking the CARES Act that saved 51 MILLION jobs.,2020-10-08 17:07:49,Twitter Web App,3,4
My bill enabled mass production of masks. I introduced this bill months before the pandemic began and then it was added to the CARES Act. We got the job done.,2020-10-08 17:05:13,Twitter Web App,4,6

A federal mask mandate isn't appropriate. This is a state and local decision. Unlike my opponent I don't think a massive bloated all-powerful federal government is a good thing.,2020-10-08 00:56:27,Twitter Web App,8,52
My opponent just said she is the fiscal conservative in this race. Her $100 TRILLION + policies beg to differ.,2020-10-08 00:55:24,Twitter Web App,7,18
My opponent just said she's not in Congress so she can't do anything with bills.  A few weeks ago she literally said she INTRODUCED BILLS IN THE SENATE.  Hmm.,2020-10-08 00:52:14,Twitter Web App,1,10
Kara is wrong again. Revenues went UP after the tax cut (prior to the pandemic). So did take-home pay for 90%+ of Nebraskans. Strongest economy in 50 years.  She can't be bothered with these facts because she wants to skyrocket taxes to pay for her massive government expansion.,2020-10-08 00:50:24,Twitter Web App,5,12
I voted "hell yes" to lowering premiums by 20% and protecting pre-existing conditions.   Kara likes to say I voted "hell yes" to a whole bunch of things but it simply isn't true.,2020-10-08 00:48:15,Twitter Web App,6,35
Kara Eastman just lied again. And again. I guess we didn't notice how much of a pattern of dishonesty and deceit there was in her campaign.,2020-10-08 00:47:41,Twitter Web App,2,10
"Lets stop talking about banning hamburgers and air travel it's ridiculous" - Kara Eastman  You support the policy Kara. Want to stop talking about it? Don't support the policy.,2020-10-08 00:44:35,Twitter Web App,8,24
My opponent is talking about climate change. Friendly reminder she supports the Green New Deal that would ban beef and cost $5 TRILLION per year. Oh and it would increase everyone's utility costs. Just a TINY BIT extreme.,2020-10-08 00:42:57,Twitter Web App,2,13
1/3 of Iraq was controlled by ISIS. Not anymore. Peace agreements in the Middle East.  Why are these things happening? Sound leadership.,2020-10-08 00:40:14,Twitter Web App,2,7
The question was about foreign policy but Kara Eastman just took 90 seconds to attack President Trump.,2020-10-08 00:39:10,Twitter Web App,9,30
My opponent supports policies that would defund the police though she lacks the courage to say the words.   Our local law enforcement community does a great job and is always seeking to improve and I'm honored to work with them.,2020-10-08 00:36:18,Twitter Web App,8,23
This question was about public safety. I'm grateful to be endorsed by the Omaha Police Officers Association Nebraska Fraternal Order of Police National (and Nebraska) Latino Peace Officers Association and more. We work together to make things better.,2020-10-08 00:35:13,Twitter Web App,4,14
Kara Eastman just said NE02 needs a Member of Congress who can work across the aisle.   She is right which is why I've worked hard to build consensus and get the job done. As proof I'm in the top 7% for bipartisanship as rated by Georgetown University.,2020-10-08 00:31:33,Twitter Web App,5,17
Hey Kara... you've been saying for months that I signed a pledge to never disagree with the President.  It's a lie. ANOTHER lie.  Prove it or apologize for lying to the voters.,2020-10-08 00:29:08,Twitter Web App,19,54
My opponent just said we need to look at people based on how they act during a campaign...  You mean like telling voters you'll refuse all corporate PAC money then using corporate PAC money to fund all your TV ads?,2020-10-08 00:27:38,Twitter Web App,8,18
If you like your doctor you can keep your doctor. We've all heard that lie before.  Now Kara Eastman says if you like your plan... too bad. She's going to take it away whether you like it or not.,2020-10-08 00:19:11,Twitter Web App,5,18
I want to expand healthcare and increase competition to reduce costs. More transparency and more options. My opponent wants a one-size-fits-all plan that kicks 180 MILLION people off their employer and union provided healthcare.,2020-10-08 00:17:03,Twitter Web App,6,15
I supported the CARES Act which saved over 51 MILLION jobs. My opponent criticized it as a "corporate bailout" but supports the hyperpartisan Heroes Act. Kara Eastman is too radical and risky for Nebraska.,2020-10-08 00:14:26,Twitter Web App,5,12
Kara Eastman is talking about Pelosi's Heroes Act like it is nothing but a COVID relief bill. Couldn't be further from the truth. This bill was a far-left wish list that released felons from prison early bailed out huge coastal cities that already had budget issues &amp; more.,2020-10-08 00:13:18,Twitter Web App,6,12
Co-sponsoring legislation is important. It's part of the process of getting the job done and making bills better. My opponent apparently thinks this process doesn't matter.,2020-10-08 00:10:37,Twitter Web App,7,19
My opponent says she refuses corporate PAC money. Virtually all of her ads are paid for by corporate PAC money. https://t.co/PG8XHYJwUK,2020-10-08 00:05:51,Twitter Web App,6,22
My opponent is talking about saving money while the policies she promotes would cost over $100 TRILLION in the next ten years alone. Something doesn't add up here.,2020-10-08 00:04:30,Twitter Web App,3,11

A reminder that my opponent supports Medicare for All that will kick off 180 million people off their employer-provided &amp; Medicare  Advantage plans. It will raise overall federal spending by 70%.

This partisan vote gave federal control over elections &amp; had an early release of felons from prison.

Chris Janicek the Dem nominee for NE Senate is right when he says Medicare for All will close 30 hospitals in Western Nebraska.

Jim our military was in grave condition in Jan 2017. Half of the Navy aircraft could not fly and 55 of 58 Army Combat Brigades could not deploy. And there’s many other stats.

Kara Eastman was elected to the Metro Board and confessed in the 2018 campaign that she MISSED 40% of the meetings that year. She SHIRKED her responsibilities and cannot be trusted in Congress. Plus her ideas are #ALittleOutThere. #NE02,2020-05-13 04:04:15,Twitter Web App,15,44
Kara Eastman opposed @realDonaldTrump's embassy move to Jerusalem. She supports BDS policies that make Israel vulnerable. I am one of the strongest PRO-ISRAEL supporters in Congress and even helped install their missile defenses. Kara's ideas are #ALittleOutThere. #NE02,2020-05-13 03:56:59,Twitter Web App,11,32
Remember when Kara Eastman said she wanted @realDonaldTrump arrested for TREASON? We don't need that kind of hyper-partisanship in Congress. We have too much of it already and #NE02 does not want to add to that problem. Plus Kara's ideas are #ALittleOutThere.,2020-05-13 03:49:49,Twitter Web App,23,48
I grew up on a farm served three decades in the Air Force defending our way of life and have a strong track record of success in Congress. Kara Eastman just wants the government to take over everything and tear down Nebraska's way of life. Her ideas are #ALittleOutThere. #NE02,2020-05-13 03:42:37,Twitter Web App,20,62
Kara Eastman wants to use your tax dollars to pay for abortions even up to the moment of birth. I am and always have been #ProLife and stand against her radical plans which are #ALittleOutThere. #NE02,2020-05-13 03:33:06,Twitter Web App,19,55
Kara Eastman claims nothing needs to be done to save Social Security. This will lead to everyone on Social Security getting a 20% cut in 2035 when it goes insolvent. I will keep Social Security strong for #NE02 seniors &amp; future generations but Kara's ideas are #ALittleOutThere.,2020-05-13 03:25:58,Twitter Web App,16,25
Radical socialists like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders support Kara Eastman. They know she'll be a reliable ally in raising your taxes to pay for their massive expansion of government. They also know her ideas are #ALittleOutThere. #NE02,2020-05-13 03:19:54,Twitter Web App,20,55
Kara Eastman will raise taxes on #smallbiz. I voted to cut taxes for #NE02 businesses and to provide relief loans during the pandemic. I support our small businesses Kara Eastman wants to tax them to death. Her ideas are #ALittleOutThere.,2020-05-13 03:11:44,Twitter Web App,15,34
Radical socialist Kara Eastman wants to kick 180 million Americans off their health insurance. I want to increase transparency while increasing options and lowering costs for #NE02 consumers allowing them to make their own decisions. Kara's ideas are #ALittleOutThere.,2020-05-13 03:02:54,Twitter Web App,27,67
Kara Eastman's government takeover of healthcare will take away union-negotiated plans everyone's private health insurance and lead to rationing of care. #NE02 says NO to socialism and Kara's ideas are #ALittleOutThere.,2020-05-13 02:44:09,Twitter Web App,23,87
Kara Eastman's extremist agenda will skyrocket our taxes to pay for a government takeover of healthcare and "free" college for everyone. I voted to cut taxes for hard-working Nebraska families and #smallbiz in #NE02. Kara's ideas are #ALittleOutThere.,2020-05-13 02:36:03,Twitter Web App,35,175

You are the perfect example that shows my comment is truthful. You support getting rid of ACA as well as trashing 180 million employer-provided and Medicare Advantage healthcare plans and at $3.2T cost per year.

The news has been hard on far left politicians who need to make folks believe we're in the 1930's depression era again in order to win votes. #NE02 voters are smart and see through the lies.  https://t.co/iGeO3cArW1,2020-01-30 16:16:21,Twitter Web App,14,41
I'm grateful to @realDonaldTrump for his endorsement! We have a great track record of success here in #Nebraska and I look forward to continuing to serve the people of #NE02 for another term. https://t.co/dAzUbpQg4j,2020-01-28 16:44:27,Twitter Web App,29,103

ICYMI- Thanks Doug Pedersen &amp; to LyncStream for hosting our most recent small biz breakfast! I had a great time speaking to a few dozen #SmallBiz folks about  the 2020 campaign and more.

I made it official yesterday &amp; filed for re-election! I was the only Republican in the country to defeat an incumbent Congressional Dem in 2016 and outperformed Republicans nationally by 9% in 2018. With your support 2020 will be another victory for our shared principles! #NE02 https://t.co/Ji09p67fqF,2020-01-23 17:36:41,Twitter Web App,23,93

@TyHenningsen @real_jperkins @karaforcongress @GOP @realDonaldTrump @BenSasse @SenatorFischer Less than 25% of Americans approve of trashing the healthcare employer/union/Medicare Advantage plans of 180 million Americans and that is the position of our far left opponent.,2020-01-23 00:23:05,Twitter for iPhone,1,3

ICYMI- It was a sold out crowd for the Nebraskans Embracing Life dinner last week! The inhumane stories shared of the abortion mills would shake the conscience of #NE02 and most Americans.  I. Am. #ProLife https://t.co/3rdn94shSD,2020-01-20 18:12:20,Twitter Web App,12,38
