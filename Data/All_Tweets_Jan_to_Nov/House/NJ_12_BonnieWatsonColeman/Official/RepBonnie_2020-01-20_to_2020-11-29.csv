Trump's discriminatory #MuslimBan goes against the fundamental principles of our Constitution.

President Trump has promised again and again that he wouldn’t touch Social Security. That was a lie. The #TrumpBudget cuts $24 BILLION from Social Security. Stealing from seniors to pay for his tax cuts for the rich. https://t.co/NIRtWrwjtN,2020-02-11 22:52:59,Twitter Web App,8,17

It's been almost one year since the House passed bipartisan sensible gun violence legislation. 100 Americans are killed with guns every day (35k+ per year) but the President could not spare one word on #gunviolence in his hour and a half speech. #GunViolenceSurvivorsWeek https://t.co/SuS2rG9N4I,2020-02-05 18:04:54,Twitter Media Studio,16,38

Yesterday it was Medicaid now it's Social Security. Trump is executing a plan long sought by Republicans to strip our most vulnerable citizens of the assistance they need.   It's just one broken promise after another.   https://t.co/4KEmyd0Hjg,2020-01-31 16:47:57,Twitter Web App,15,25

It is crazy that in 2020 after spending a year of educating people on slavery’s roots that we are still comparing anything to 400 years of racial abuse violence and bondage.
