Un crimen deleznable. Una mujer de 20 años sirviendo a su país no merecía una muerte así; tampoco una investigación tan lenta luego de su desaparición.

Bottom line:  No one should be deprived from financial government help during a pandemic because of their immigration status.  Denying aid to U.S. citizens -particularly children- is cruel and humane.   It’s also illegal.   #CARESAct,2020-05-12 16:08:20,Twitter for iPhone,5,12
