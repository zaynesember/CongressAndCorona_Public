Tuesday July 14 ⏰5PM  The COVID-19 pandemic clearly revealed how many workers are considered both essential and expendable— a tragic contradiction that is costing lives.

My amendment w/ @RepEspaillat @RepCohen &amp; @RepHankJohnson modestly increases the minimum insurance requirements &amp; requires that it keep up w/inflation.   This isn't about trial lawyers or an attack on truckers. It’s about supporting families who have lost loved ones.,2020-06-17 22:32:15,Twitter Web App,4,13
Minimum insurance requirements for motor carriers were established in 1980 &amp; have never been adjusted for inflation. It’s inadequate and saddles families with crippling medical care costs resulting from catastrophic crashes.,2020-06-17 22:31:53,Twitter Web App,2,9

I offer my #TransitEquity amendment which would quadruple transit funding without cutting highways to highlight that we do not have to operate in a zero-sum game. We do not have to remain tied to over 60-year-old formulas to fund our infrastructure.,2020-06-17 22:24:46,Twitter Web App,15,76
Everyone can agree our transportation systems are outdated.    For decades we have relied on an 80-20 ratio to fund highways &amp; transit. This split has starved our cities &amp; all our communities from needed transit investments &amp; opportunities for the least among us.,2020-06-17 22:24:16,Twitter Web App,11,77
Transportation policy is a social justice issue.   Across the country our built environment has been used to segregate Black &amp;  Brown communities. From train tracks to boulevards and highways. Our policies create or break down physical barriers to opportunity.,2020-06-17 22:21:58,Twitter Web App,166,463
This amendment forces us to look at the long-term lifecycle costs for new construction &amp; improves existing cost-benefit analysis requirements.   These small but important changes will help ensure we prioritize maintenance &amp; bring our existing infrastructure up to date.,2020-06-17 22:04:00,Twitter Web App,1,3
We can build on the “fix-it-first” principles in the INVEST Act to promote maintenance and be more fiscally responsible.

And that’s why @RepKatiePorter and I introduced the Systemic Risk Mitigation Act a bill that ensures that systemically important financial institutions like BlackRock get regulatory oversight.  https://t.co/EbTgaUqWTS,2020-05-14 17:57:57,Twitter Web App,5,4
That’s why @RepRashida @RepPressley and I wrote to the Fed and Treasury demanding oversight of BlackRock’s contracts to make sure this shadow bank doesn’t become a shadow government.   https://t.co/suU6KMhaNm,2020-05-14 17:56:59,Twitter Web App,4,3
It’s outrageous that BlackRock employees can get rich by trading off of the company’s public contract and it’s frightening that this firm seems to be too big to regulate.  It’s up to Congress to demand rigorous oversight of the Fed’s programs. https://t.co/EUcTR6umSQ,2020-05-14 17:55:38,Twitter Web App,6,12

Trump has made some "bold" claims about his work on health care.   But as we speak Trump is trying to block grant Medicaid which threatens care for working families. He has also threatened to cut Medicare. #TrumpLies #SOTU  https://t.co/Wu3IkpGyvm,2020-02-05 02:59:10,Twitter Web App,7,12
Trump has done nothing to help lower prescription drug prices.   Instead he lets #BigPharma CEOs continue price gouging working people to the point of bankruptcy. #TrumpRxScam #SOTU  https://t.co/8UOUH2ffPj,2020-02-05 02:54:00,Twitter Web App,34,63
If Trump truly cared about Cubans or Venezuelans he wouldn’t deport them or refuse to grant them #TPS. Instead Trump continues to use struggling immigrants as a talking point without creating policies that actually help them. #SOTU,2020-02-05 02:39:57,Twitter Web App,25,60
Remember This:  When Trump boasts about his military spending he is also trying to divert billions of dollars from existing military construction projects to fund his racist border wall.  #SOTU,2020-02-05 02:33:35,Twitter Web App,53,139

The @SenateGOP can hide from witnesses. They can protect the President at all costs.  But they can’t hide from history.   Donald Trump violated the rule of law and put his political interests above the Constitution.   This is a stain on our democracy that will not be forgotten. https://t.co/y3ns9qDkxx,2020-01-31 23:01:18,Twitter Web App,70,158
Allowing states to block grant Medicaid is just Trump’s latest effort to punish hard-working families struggling to make ends meet.

Formerly deported veteran Miguel Perez Jr. will be my guest for the #StateOfTheUnion.
