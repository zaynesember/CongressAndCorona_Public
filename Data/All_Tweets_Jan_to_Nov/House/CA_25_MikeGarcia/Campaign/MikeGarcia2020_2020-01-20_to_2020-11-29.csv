In just 4 months Vote Centers will be opening for the November election. Last month #TeamGarcia showed the nation the power of a grassroots movement even during the #COVID19 stay-at-home orders. Let's keep pushing to stop liberal Sacramento policies from spreading to DC!,2020-06-24 23:11:47,Twitter for iPhone,219,804
Not only did @ChristyforCA25 vote to pass #AB5 but now as we face a $54 billion deficit she wants $20 million to go after the workers and small businesses who have been hit hardest by the pandemic. We can’t let her bring these liberal policies to DC.  https://t.co/Pnrfmwkr3I,2020-06-22 22:06:17,Twitter for iPhone,180,431

I’m proud to be a co-sponsor of the #JUSTICEAct introduced today in the House. This bill would increase accountability and provide law enforcement critical resources they need to protect our communities. Real answers not political showboating. Defunding police isn’t the answer.,2020-06-19 02:04:02,Twitter for iPhone,118,459
My stepfather was an LAPD officer so I know that slashing police budgets will only hurt our families and communities. The movement to #DefundThePolice is resulting in damaging policy changes and that has to stop. I hope @ChristyforCA25 agrees.  https://t.co/uvYIdPErsV,2020-06-18 00:08:37,Twitter for iPhone,62,220
On July 1 the gas tax will rise to 50.5 cents/gal. I’ve opposed the tax increase from the beginning while @ChristyforCA25 refused to speak up.

1/ First they refuse to take a pay cut when the state needs it most.
