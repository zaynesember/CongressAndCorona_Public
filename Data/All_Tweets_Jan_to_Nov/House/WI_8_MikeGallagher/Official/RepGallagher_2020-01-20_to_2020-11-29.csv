We cannot let our adversaries succeed either in letting the embargo lapse or destroying the US veto.

What's more as @Rich_Goldberg argued in @ForeignPolicy over the weekend the stakes are larger than the arms embargo itself.

So the question is this: will we use our right--a right that was central to the campaign to sell the JCPOA to the American public--to protect our nation from China Russia and Iran?

To its credit the Obama admin negotiated language in a UN Security Council Resolution giving the US the right to snap back all sanctions on Iran at precisely a time like this. If you read UNSCR 2231 it's clear that the US retains that right today.,2020-08-17 22:16:08,Twitter Web App,4,12
In May I joined nearly 400 members of Congress in urging @SecPompeo to do all he could to keep the embargo alive. China and Russia don't want that to happen. They want to sell Iran advanced weapons and draw US attention away from their malign activities.,2020-08-17 22:16:08,Twitter Web App,12,23

Yesterday we saw the CCP end one country two systems. We must ensure Taiwan never falls to the same fate. My bill with @HawleyMO helps ensure the US military has the capabilities and resources it needs to block a CCP invasion of Taiwan. https://t.co/q8A19S5OBc,2020-07-01 15:24:26,Twitter for iPad,123,404

To all of NEW’s 2020 grads: while you may be disappointed in the way your senior year ended remember your diploma will last you a lifetime. As you prepare for your life’s next chapter here’s some advice from not just me but also from some of the smartest people I know ⬇️ https://t.co/Y1YB9w67AL,2020-06-07 20:00:22,Twitter Media Studio,6,23
There’s a growing debate about whether we’re in a New Cold War with the Chinese Communist Party. But far from the straw man it is often portrayed as I write in @WSJopinion that Cold War thinking offers a judicious and adaptable framework for our time. https://t.co/wyFKX3f6K8,2020-06-07 17:47:37,Twitter for iPhone,1243,1354
We’d all like to see our allies make larger investments to support our collective defense. But this is not the way to do that. I urge the administration to reconsider this decision. https://t.co/YifymbvN0c,2020-06-06 21:55:16,Twitter for iPhone,16,73
Cutting our forces in Germany not only reduces our forward presence and our ability to deter aggression in Europe but it will end up costing us more. Troops leaving Germany will have to go somewhere and wherever they go they won’t have the benefit of German financial support.,2020-06-06 21:55:16,Twitter for iPhone,23,78
To deny we must be forward. Our forces in Germany are a critical lynchpin of this forward presence. Not only does Germany have unparalleled supporting infrastructure but it provides millions of dollars to help fund the US presence.,2020-06-06 21:55:15,Twitter for iPhone,4,47
The National Defense Strategy rightly prioritizes these forward forces today. Rather than punish adversary aggression after the fact the NDS emphasizes a posture of deterrence by denial which seeks to deny adversaries their attempted conquests in the first place.,2020-06-06 21:55:15,Twitter for iPhone,3,44
The war was a terrible lesson that American needed to defend forward. No longer could we sit back across the ocean and let the storm clouds gather. In the ensuing decades our forward presence won the Cold War by successfully deterring a Soviet invasion of Western Europe.,2020-06-06 21:55:14,Twitter for iPhone,5,44
The extraordinary sacrifices made on that day of days did not come out of thin air. In the 1930s deterrence failed our adversaries saw a free world unwilling to impose costs on aggression and democracies were late to mobilize against the Nazi war machine.,2020-06-06 21:55:13,Twitter for iPhone,6,39
THREAD ➡️ 76 years ago today tens of thousands of Americans along with our allies displayed unparalleled courage on the beaches and causeways of Normandy beginning the long process of liberating Europe from Nazi rule.,2020-06-06 21:55:12,Twitter for iPhone,54,175
Between now and July 20 the House is scheduled to be in session for a mere 3 days. This is insane.   Today I’ll be joining my friend @RepRoKhanna on Instagram Live at 6:30pm CT to discuss how this is unacceptable and why Congress needs to get back to work. https://t.co/VvMrypv8B9,2020-06-05 20:46:50,Twitter for iPhone,5,13
Today's jobs report is a step in the right direction but we're not out of the woods yet.

We must remember that horrific actions by some don't represent the actions of all.

Today we got the revised legislative calendar for this year and it's disappointing to say the least. From now until mid-July Congress will be in-session for...three days.   This is insane.

Last April I introduced the PLA Visa Security Act with @SenTomCotton and @RepHartzler to block researchers affiliated with the PLA from receiving F or J visas. Today @POTUS did exactly this. It's time for Congress to codify this vital step. https://t.co/c0DwFX5y5J,2020-05-29 21:40:14,Twitter for iPad,12,37
Brown County has more than twice as many Coronavirus cases as Dane County yet will receive less than half of the aid the Governor allocated for Dane County. This makes no sense. Governor Evers needs to distribute funding by need -- not population size. https://t.co/WVWbuyWBpr,2020-05-29 19:40:17,Twitter for iPad,2,18
In March @BenSasse and I wrote to @jack asking why Twitter gives CCP officials a loudspeaker to spread propaganda while denying their citizens access to its platform.

We have to be much more vigilant about how the CCP is using the swamp against us. I have legislation that gets at part of this problem but sunlight is the ultimate disinfectant. The status quo is not acceptable.,2020-05-23 17:33:40,Twitter for iPad,58,114
Is a former Senator and US Ambassador comparing the President to Hitler on the state channel of a communist dictatorship that has put more than a million of its own citizens into concentration camps gross? Of course. But that's only part of the problem.,2020-05-23 17:33:39,Twitter for iPad,64,110
Individuals corporations or countries that adapt pro-CCP talking points and policies receive lucrative rewards. Those who challenge the Party orthodoxy are punished. We’ve seen this time and again. The CCP relies on foreign elites to promote its interests.,2020-05-23 17:33:39,Twitter for iPad,2268,2249
The Party’s core identity as well as that of its leaders is tied to these types of influence operations which the Party calls United Front work. The Party works through elites in capitals worldwide to advance this agenda connecting economic incentives w/ political compliance.,2020-05-23 17:33:38,Twitter for iPad,78,97
The CCP credits its underground influence operations for playing a decisive role in its victory in the civil war. As @jgarnaut has argued many of the key individuals in the CCP today—including Xi —are actually the sons of these espionage artists from the Party’s earliest days.,2020-05-23 17:33:37,Twitter for iPad,22,31
While many of the details in the story were shocking the bottom line shouldn't have been surprising. The CCP was born to take advantage of the swamp. The Party spent its formative years waging an insurgency within China relying on intelligence activities and irregular warfare.,2020-05-23 17:33:37,Twitter for iPad,19,31

The world cannot lose its backbone and fail to stand up for a besieged democracy. We've seen where this road leads too many times in the past. As I wrote in the @NRO the free world must stand with Taiwan. https://t.co/FqF2oAoQU5,2020-05-19 01:34:40,Twitter for iPad,3,27
And what message does that send to the Uighurs enduring this disease while crammed into concentration camps? Did it even occur to anyone at the WHO as the Chinese government announced a large donation to ask about health conditions in Xinjiang?,2020-05-19 01:34:40,Twitter for iPad,4,16
Shockingly the WHO invited General Secretary Xi to open the assembly. What message does that send to other regimes thinking of covering-up the next pandemic? What message does that send to Dr. Li Wenliang and the other brave Chinese who tried to warn the world about the crisis?,2020-05-19 01:34:40,Twitter for iPad,2,12
Instead in the middle of a pandemic that threatens millions of lives and has crashed economies around the world the Chinese Communist Party is prioritizing its campaign to snuff out Taiwan’s freedom. All because its pervasive insecurity demands it.,2020-05-19 01:34:40,Twitter for iPad,2,12
THREAD ➡️ Today the WHO was set to vote on Taiwan's observer status at its annual World Health Assembly. An invitation--even at the observer level--would have helped Taiwan contribute its invaluable perspective to the forum. https://t.co/xt3XnSjTlu,2020-05-19 01:34:37,Twitter for iPad,15,81
In the midst of this crisis the last thing Congress should be doing is playing politics.

I’ve seen a lot of bad legislation but Speaker Pelosi’s bill on proxy voting may be the worst. I discuss how this accelerates two concerning Congressional trends in the video below ⬇️ https://t.co/gorpavGTIr,2020-05-16 00:43:43,Twitter for iPhone,18,82
Congressional rules can be confusing but this proxy voting scheme is simple: it would undo centuries of precedent and allow the Speaker to pass legislation with fewer than 25 out of 435 members present. This is insane. https://t.co/n20pDpFNIQ,2020-05-15 23:46:25,Twitter for iPad,26,47
These moves work especially well when viewed in concert. While we need to block Huawei as much as possible unless we make proactive investments we will never win long term. Working with our allies to reduce dependency--both ways--on the Chinese market is the sweet spot.,2020-05-15 19:59:40,Twitter for iPad,30,77
And then today @CommerceGov announced a critical new rule that closes a loophole through which US technology was still going to support Huawei's campaign for 5G domination. This will dramatically expand pressure and better secure our networks. https://t.co/sxklZwsEzq,2020-05-15 19:59:40,Twitter for iPad,33,78
Yesterday the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) announced a $12 B investment to build a state of the art semiconductor factory in Arizona.

It's hard to get two members to agree on anything let alone more than 260.

Instead of calling the House into session to come up with a bipartisan Phase 4 relief package Speaker Pelosi kept us out of town and came up with a $3 trillion 1815 page progressive wishlist.

As a Marine you learn to ride to the sound of the guns. When setting goals as a civilian exercise that same mentality. Once you’re discharged go where the action is. Push yourself outside your comfort zone &amp; use the skills you’ve learned to achieve what you want. #VeteransChat https://t.co/wiMR7YmX0G,2020-05-12 17:55:12,Twitter for iPad,4,15
Even with a strong support network I skipped simple tasks and didn’t take advantage of all the resources available to me at the time.,2020-05-12 17:48:53,Twitter for iPad,1,2
I would’ve looked for more help. When I discharged I was eager to start my life. But I didn’t realize just how many resources were available to me in the form of VA benefits and local VSOs. #VeteransChat https://t.co/1FOlrPo8U2,2020-05-12 17:48:45,Twitter for iPad,5,14
Incidentally this ethos of selfless service is what makes veterans such an asset in any workplace. We can work in teams to get difficult jobs done. #VeteransChat,2020-05-12 17:40:49,Twitter for iPad,1,8
Officers eat last. We have a duty to help others to look out for our subordinates first. Particularly those of us who have benefitted from great mentorship in our careers I believe we have a duty to pay that back. #VeteransChat https://t.co/tpumyLNrjJ,2020-05-12 17:40:42,Twitter for iPad,4,11
Be open be honest and let your mentor know when you need help. Your mentor has been in your shoes — he or she knows the ins and outs of transitioning back to civilian life and can show you the ropes through even the littlest of matters. #VeteransChat https://t.co/2otQHdBd74,2020-05-12 17:31:46,Twitter for iPad,3,10

Don't be embarrassed to ask for help. Drop the tough guy/gal act and seek assistance (i.e. leadership principle: know yourself and seek self-improvement).

The belief that our military experience will fit nicely with every civilian job is a common blind spot in large part because not every civilian company understands fully the nature of military experience or the specific skills we gain from our military occupational specialties. https://t.co/uWjuj0cvEi,2020-05-12 17:16:26,Twitter for iPad,2,2
Often we don't realize how overwhelming some of the basics of civilian life can be until after we are discharged. That alone can be a difficult adjustment. #VeteransChat,2020-05-12 17:11:41,Twitter for iPad,2,13
Consider how many choices the military makes for you when you're on active duty. Basic things like monthly financial planning getting a loan for a house or starting to save for your kids' school may not even cross your radar if you're living on base and deploying all the time.,2020-05-12 17:11:38,Twitter for iPad,2,6
Recently discharged veterans myself included tend to think that the transition to civilian life will be easy. For many it’s not. Veterans should accept advice during their transition and understand that civilian life comes with challenges we just don't face in the military. https://t.co/Ng9UHcHemD,2020-05-12 17:11:30,Twitter for iPad,2,8
Veterans in my area do a remarkable job of helping others find peer mentors. Groups like the NEW Battalion are “the missing link for the transitioning process” and show how veterans support each other as civilians just as they did in combat. #VeteransChat https://t.co/TvQIcKrRoZ,2020-05-12 17:03:56,Twitter for iPad,2,6
As veterans we have different experiences and speak a different language than our civilian counterparts — that can be a difficult adjustment.

Community Health Centers play a critical role in keeping Wisconsinites healthy during this pandemic. Today I joined @RepGrothman and the WI delegation in calling on Congressional leadership to ensure these centers receive adequate funding and aren’t left behind in this crisis. https://t.co/2D9dx9ZZhI,2020-05-06 00:48:16,Twitter for iPad,4,8
Now more than ever we need to do all we can to get PPE to Wisconsinites working around the clock to protect our communities. This extremely generous donation from @MOFA_Taiwan will go a long way in helping our state fight this pandemic.   https://t.co/yiCeCsBz1g,2020-05-05 16:04:47,Twitter for iPad,9,51
I am proud to announce that @MOFA_Taiwan will be delivering 100000 surgical grade masks to Wisconsin. Our state is a place where common sense is a common virtue and we understand both our friends and foes.

Australia was the canary in the coal mine for the way in which the CCP ruthlessly wages economic &amp; ideological warfare. What lessons can the US &amp; other countries learn from their response? I explore this &amp; more with Australian MP Andrew Hastie on this week's NEW Look Podcast. https://t.co/qRD89fru04,2020-05-04 23:16:18,Twitter Media Studio,16,33
Pottinger is providing us with the playbook. Like Reagan we need to wage a constant ideological struggle against the CCP that emphasizes not the differences between western and Chinese values but their common foundations--both of which stand in opposition to the CCP today.,2020-05-04 18:59:25,Twitter for iPad,4,5
In a lot of ways it's reminiscent of a speech Reagan gave at Moscow State which I wrote about for the @ReaganInstitute.  Pottinger uses Chinese history and culture to annihilate the CCP's domestic political legitimacy not through condescension but by seeking truth from facts.,2020-05-04 18:59:24,Twitter for iPad,4,3
This is a remarkable speech by Matt Pottinger on the 101st anniversary of the May Fourth Movement. Speaking candidly and plainly to the Chinese public he lays out a compelling case that the CCP has betrayed the heroes of May 4th. https://t.co/JNmeDOGmsO,2020-05-04 18:59:22,Twitter for iPad,21,37
This is a good plan by my colleagues @GOPLeader @TomColeOK04 and @RodneyDavis. In a time of crisis it’s essential that Congress is in session working on behalf of the American people.

.@Avik is exactly right: “In­stead of think­ing up cre­ative ways to force peo­ple to stay home we should think hard every day about how to bring more peo­ple back to work.”  We have to listen to and empower the localities &amp; organizations doing just that. https://t.co/uwfEgf1kx5,2020-04-25 20:00:02,Twitter for iPad,21,45

.@SenMikeLee is 100% right. This is a time for Congress to legislate not leave critical decisions in the hands of a few.

10. Find strength in our community. Northeast Wisconsin’s strength is the quality and heart of this community. We all need to do our part to help our neighbors support local nonprofits and businesses and get through this the way we do best—together.,2020-04-16 18:11:48,Twitter for iPad,1,3
9. Reopen state parks with caveats. More than ever this is a time where Wisconsinites need to be able to get fresh air and a dose of sanity. Whether it’s closing parking lots maintaining limited hours or keeping a skeleton ranger crew on hand we need to get creative.,2020-04-16 18:11:46,Twitter for iPad,1,4
8. Come up with a bipartisan election plan now. The August primary will be here before we know it and soon after November. We should start immediately planning to ensure they go off without a hitch — the legitimacy of our democracy is at stake.,2020-04-16 18:11:46,Twitter for iPad,0,2
7. Focus on our dairy farmers. Wisconsin’s dairy sector desperately needs help. Federal funds are a start but until we break the bottleneck at the processor level we will be stuck seeing rationing at grocery stores while our farmers are forced to dump excess milk.,2020-04-16 18:11:45,Twitter for iPad,2,7
6. School’s in for summer. Our students can’t afford to lose a half year or more of schooling. High schools should consider more online classes while younger classes may want to make use of empty high schools to move to in person instruction in significantly smaller groups.,2020-04-16 18:11:45,Twitter for iPad,1,2
5. Continue to support small business. Congress desperately needs to add resources to the Paycheck Protection Program which ran through $350 billion in two weeks. Every day we delay putting more money into this program is a day we risk seeing hardworking businesses go under.,2020-04-16 18:11:44,Twitter for iPad,1,3
4. Maintain strict social distancing for the most at risk populations including the elderly and those with compromised immune systems. We’ll have to continue pitching in to help these individuals as they may not be able to return to normal until a vaccine is widely available.,2020-04-16 18:11:43,Twitter for iPad,0,2
3. Develop responsible contact tracing and antibody analysis for individuals who have been infected. The private sector is doing great work in this regard and we need to leverage these resources and put them to work on behalf of Wisconsinites.,2020-04-16 18:11:43,Twitter for iPad,0,4
2. Testing testing and more testing. The sooner our labs and hospitals have the ability to provide quick and accessible tests to a majority of Wisconsinites the sooner we can end the lockdown.,2020-04-16 18:11:42,Twitter for iPad,1,8
1. We need a bipartisan task force charged with creating a plan to reopen WI.

By allowing us to code DNA like we code computers synthetic biology has revolutionary potential. But what is synthetic biology and how can it help us combat the CCP virus? I explore these questions with Matt McKnight CCO at Ginkgo Bioworks on this week’s NEW Look podcast. https://t.co/1cDW2gSw3x,2020-04-13 20:01:09,Twitter for iPad,5,19

Hope in the face of darkness is the fundamental message of Easter.

When the time comes to transition to phase two of our response to this crisis we have to emphasize a bottom-up approach. Yesterday I spoke with @TeamCavuto about why it’s important that states have data to find a solution that best fits their own unique needs. https://t.co/R9Wb2zeqXf,2020-04-11 21:29:24,Twitter for iPhone,4,19
During this time of crisis we are painfully coming to the realization that our pharmaceutical supply chains are far too reliant on China. Today I spoke with @TeamCavuto about my bill to move these critical supply chains out of China and bring this manufacturing back home. https://t.co/EMY5LXxX40,2020-04-10 21:05:07,Twitter for iPad,15,56
State parks provide us with space to exercise and be outside both essential activities.

As I discussed at the @ReaganInstitute in December it is long past time to move critical supply chains out of China. When it comes to strategic sectors like pharmaceuticals or microelectronics we cannot let the CCP control our supply. https://t.co/W6LEAmtdQD https://t.co/PMeoGQEg1A,2020-04-09 18:40:31,Twitter for iPad,16,37

Great joining @LRacheldG on the @DailySignal podcast to discuss why its critical we move our pharmaceutical supply chains out of China and additional actions Congress should take to combat the Coronavirus. Listen to the full interview here: https://t.co/FlpGnUG3Zn,2020-04-08 17:09:46,Twitter for iPad,81,105
This is no time for partisan theatrics. It's time to continue what is working fix what isn't support our neighbors and get through this as we always have--as a community.,2020-04-08 16:19:28,Twitter for iPad,1,8
But while we need to fix these pressing issues we also can’t let this distract from defeating this disease. There aren’t enough dollars to print if we fail to contain this virus and any additional action should surge more resources and support to the frontlines of the fight.,2020-04-08 16:19:28,Twitter for iPad,1,6
I'm glad to see initial reports indicating Congress could add to the pool of PPP resources available for small businesses. Across NEW small businesses are desperately awaiting the help they need to meet payroll make rent and survive another day. Relief cannot come soon enough.,2020-04-08 16:19:27,Twitter for iPad,0,5
Third despite Congressional intent SBA has severely restricted non-payroll loan forgiveness in order to maximize the number of businesses that can benefit from the program. To fix this Congress should add more funding AND provide more flexibility in how the loans can be used.,2020-04-08 16:19:26,Twitter for iPad,0,7
Second we need to support startups—some of which may help prevent future pandemics—by ensuring there’s no confusion around the SBA's affiliation rules. SBA should ensure lenders have the clarity they need to expeditiously make loans to innovative startups.,2020-04-08 16:19:26,Twitter for iPad,0,2
At the same time we still have to address outstanding issues. For one some lenders are unsure whether PPP eligibility definitions exclude many NEW dairy farms from receiving support. SBA should immediately clarify that dairy farms do not have to meet SBA’s NAICS codes.,2020-04-08 16:19:25,Twitter for iPad,0,2
While anything on the scale of the CARES Act will take time Northeast Wisconsin's small businesses do not have weeks to wait. We must be laser-focused on processing PPP loans as quickly as possible in order to get cash into the hands of those who need it most--yesterday.,2020-04-08 16:19:25,Twitter for iPad,0,3
THREAD ➡️ Before speculation about the next Coronavirus relief package gets out of hand Congress must pause efforts to include special interest projects and ideological pipe dreams. Instead we need to devote our attention to implementing and fixing what is already on the books.,2020-04-08 16:19:21,Twitter for iPad,4,15
This was a difficult week for our Navy but we can’t give up the ship.

As a maritime nation our physical security begins and ends with command of the seas. Maritime superiority is not a birthright but a hard-won status we can’t surrender. The task ahead for the Navy and advocates in Congress is not easy but it is simple: don’t give up the ship.,2020-04-08 01:58:32,Twitter for iPad,12,39
In other words we need a course correction at flank speed. Front page incidents are starting to pile up taking with them close to a generation of seasoned leaders. Morale is down. Budgets are inadequate. Enemies are investing heavily in hard power particularly seapower.,2020-04-08 01:58:31,Twitter for iPad,3,17
Even as investigations continue the Navy must turn the page. That starts with Senate-confirmed leadership at the top a commitment to transparency and a willingness to communicate a simple vision of geopolitically-informed integrated American seapower directly to the public.,2020-04-08 01:58:30,Twitter for iPad,3,13
While I am grateful for his service it was no longer tenable for Secretary Modly to lead the Navy. Many Americans rightly have questions about the state of their Navy and it is imperative that we understand the events that led to Capt. Crozier sending his letter on March 30.,2020-04-08 01:58:30,Twitter for iPad,2,11
THREAD ➡️ The past week has been extraordinarily difficult for our Navy. I know the frustration that many sailors might be feeling right now &amp; I hope they know a grateful nation has their back. America asks its Navy to make incredible sacrifices daily &amp; they do not go unnoticed.,2020-04-08 01:58:25,Twitter for iPad,17,59
On this #WorldHealthDay we are especially thankful for the medical professionals on the frontlines of this fight. If you know one of the many medical professionals risking their lives to keep us safe take a second to say thank you.

Step 1: Control the disease &amp; “flatten the curve”   Step 2: Plan for an intermediate way to re-open the economy while protecting the most vulnerable among us while practicing social distancing   Step 3: Defeat COVID-19 &amp; shore up our supply chains so this doesn’t happen again https://t.co/PGCvPn4QNu,2020-03-25 17:31:14,Twitter for iPhone,7,22
The CCP’s threat to withhold lifesaving drugs from the US is a matter of national security and to many a matter of life and death. It’s clear we at a minimum should move our pharmaceutical supply chains out of China.  https://t.co/VDVn9v0MC3,2020-03-25 17:13:46,Twitter for iPad,104,197

It is unrealistic to choose between economic devastation on the one hand and millions of deaths on the other. That is a false choice. With better use of data and bottom-up solutions tailored to the unique needs of our states we can Cancel the Apocalypse. https://t.co/mCJJbje4vu,2020-03-24 19:36:34,Twitter for iPad,1,12
But it’s unlikely we’ll have “business as usual” by Easter so we must start planning for the next phase of this war. I believe this requires:   1. A strict but strategic quarantine  2. Work at a distance 3. School in the summer 4. Support to the frontline 5. Better use of data,2020-03-24 19:36:30,Twitter for iPad,0,7
Great to hear that @POTUS is starting to think through how we can continue to work while also containing and killing Coronavirus.

As states like WI face shortages of critical medical supplies it’s clear we can’t leave anything on the sidelines.

This is an unprecedented crisis that will require unprecedented action. But that doesn’t mean we can allow the relief package to become an Easter basket full of carveouts for corporate &amp; special interests. In this bill we have to put small businesses &amp; vulnerable Americans first.,2020-03-22 01:31:36,Twitter for iPad,2,13
3) A focus on community banks. In 2008 one idea that worked was allowing the FDIC to extend unlimited insurance for transaction accounts. This helped prevent a run on small banks and sent a badly needed message that money is safe with local lenders. We should replicate that now.,2020-03-22 01:31:35,Twitter for iPad,3,7
2) Immediate and sustained aid to the most vulnerable among us. Paid sick leave is great but the process is convoluted and doesn’t help those getting laid off. We need to get checks to working Americans now and expand unemployment insurance programs for those who need them.,2020-03-22 01:31:34,Twitter for iPad,2,6
1) A loan program that provides immediate relief to small businesses. These would be paid over a long-term period at 0% interest and allow businesses to delay initial payments up to 3 months giving employers access to the cash they need to get through the worst of this crisis.,2020-03-22 01:31:33,Twitter for iPad,2,7
THREAD ➡️ As we consider a massive stimulus plan our priority needs to be helping working families and small businesses navigate these difficult times.

Bottom line: mobile testing will play a huge part in helping us avoid overloading our hospital system. But this doesn’t mean everyone should get tested. We still can’t process massive amounts of tests so call your doctor first and follow the steps above if you have symptoms. https://t.co/xQgAtlczAp,2020-03-19 23:59:10,Twitter for iPhone,0,5
The idea is that if you have symptoms you should:   1. Call your doctor to see if you should get a test 2. Schedule an appointment if so 3. Drive up and get tested 4. Drive home and continue to self-quarantine   More info on who to call here: https://t.co/FWQCFoirbg,2020-03-19 23:58:43,Twitter for iPhone,1,9

This is why my colleagues and I are calling on FDA to expedite supplies to WI labs and hospitals. Ultimately the more flexibility the FDA provides testing facilities and the more supplies we can provide/support we can give manufacturers the faster testing can be done. https://t.co/0xqxbjYr9q,2020-03-19 18:13:34,Twitter for iPad,2,4
These are all positive steps but we need to do more. There are still shortages of testing supplies in Wisconsin and backlogs delaying our ability to get accurate counts.  Everyday we as policymakers should wake up and think about actions we can take to rapidly expand testing.,2020-03-19 18:13:33,Twitter for iPad,1,2

Wisconsin is ready to expand its testing capacity but shortages of reagents and other supplies are greatly limiting our ability to do so. Today I joined @RepRonKind &amp; the delegation in calling on the FDA to work with @DHSWI to get WI hospitals &amp; labs the supplies they need ASAP. https://t.co/FYx6usItI5,2020-03-19 17:44:32,Twitter for iPad,11,27
