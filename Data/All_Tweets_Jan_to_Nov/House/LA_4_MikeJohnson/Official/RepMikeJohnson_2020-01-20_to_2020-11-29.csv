The PPP has helped save over 100000 jobs in our district alone. But many  businesses are still struggling to keep their doors open.

Hurricane Laura caused catastrophic damage that surpasses the capabilities of state &amp; local govs. to fully recover without federal assistance.

The #SCOTUS seat should be filled immediately. We have the time &amp; despite the false (&amp; dangerous) rhetoric coming from the Left filling a seat before an election when both the Senate &amp; the President are in the same party aligns with precedent.

My friend Amy Coney Barrett is the talk of Capitol Hill today as she the perceived frontrunner to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court.

Amy Coney Barrett has been a friend of mine for more than 30 years and for so many reasons I believe she is the IDEAL pick for the Supreme Court.

Senate Democrats arguing that Republicans are wrong or hypocritical to fill the open SCOTUS seat apparently do not understand history (and/or the clear difference between this situation and Merrick Garland in 2016). The truth is very simple.  #FillTheSeat https://t.co/aiK5wpnLMh,2020-09-20 20:37:35,Twitter Web App,173,525
Amy Coney Barrett would be the ideal SCOTUS nominee. She is a brilliant jurist &amp; an intellectually consistent conservative who reveres the Constitution. I've known her since high school in LA as an exceptional person of faith &amp; the highest moral integrity.,2020-09-19 21:55:53,Twitter Web App,344,1235

@POTUS’s EO ensures any person or group who destroys or vandalizes a monument memorial or statue –or who incites violence &amp; illegal activity– is prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.

@AnnCoulter Hi Ann- I've made a career over 20 yrs citing the Bible to defend obeying the law &amp; upholding the rule of law. We can be tough on crime (e.g. Romans 13) &amp; still make wise use of clemency in those cases where it's warranted. It's an important part of our constitutional tradition.,2020-03-06 22:25:32,Twitter for Android,3,38
Yesterday @RepDougCollins and I were openly mocked by a colleague for making the spiritual AND constitutional case for the use of clemency.   President Reagan once said: "If we ever forget that we are One Nation Under God we will be a nation gone under."

I'm not listening to the media or the polling I'm listening to Louisianians.

Our defense team has done its job. We've shown Adam Schiff &amp; Co. have no case no evidence and no justification for impeaching a duly elected president.

Schiff's case boils down to this:   We loathe Trump &amp; committed in '16 to impeach him.  After 3 yrs of bogus investigations &amp; the violation of due process &amp; all rules...we found nothing.    But we proceeded anyway.  We know this tramples upon the Constitution.

Impeachment was intended to be a rare almost nuclear option.

Today we'll present the most important argument in this trial: the Senate's first job in an impeachment is to decide whether the Articles of Impeachment are valid and legitimate.
