THANK YOU!!!!  For all the feedback last night. I chose not to attend SOTU because Trump has disgraced his office but 63% of Facebook users said I should go while 70% of Twitter users said I should not. I enjoyed reading all your comments and plan to ask again in the future. https://t.co/gSd0pexsTM,2020-02-05 15:30:11,Hootsuite Inc.,4,14
