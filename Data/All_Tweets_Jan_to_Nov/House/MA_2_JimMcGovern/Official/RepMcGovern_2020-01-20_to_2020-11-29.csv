Trump never drained the swamp. He turned it into a cesspool and filled it with the most corrupt liars and crooks he could find.   Nero fiddled while Rome burned; Trump pardoned while the pandemic raged. He is the worst excuse for a president in the history of the United States. https://t.co/8gtyDbU1pf,2020-11-25 22:02:06,Twitter Web App,67,256
Hunger is a political condition. We have the food. We have the means to distribute it. We have the compassion to know it's the right thing to do. What we lack is the political will.

30M Americans are unemployed through no fault of their own. They need groceries. They have bills. Their rent is due soon.  McConnell &amp; Trump's answer? Cut unemployment benefits.

@KunchokTendar It’s a crime to seek campaign assistance from a foreign gov’t. Mueller didn’t charge because he couldn’t prove Don Jr. knew it was illegal.

@KunchokTendar You &amp; I evidently got very different copies of the Mueller Report.   Trump &amp; his team knew about Russian interference welcomed it &amp; built a press strategy around it.

10 weeks. It's been 10 weeks since House Democrats passed the #HeroesAct.  That's two months of rent payments. 70 days of crushing demand at food pantries.

@HillTownTrader1 @RepDavidTrone We’ll have to agree to disagree. There’s plenty of data showing that it’s nearly impossible for many working families to get by now because of stagnant wages.

@HillTownTrader1 @RepDavidTrone It sounds like your mind is made up.  Yes the MA minimum wage is higher but there are 100s of 1000s of people in America who make the federal minimum of $7.25 &amp; barely scrape by.  It impacts MA as our tax dollars go to federal programs that help those people.,2020-07-10 19:36:08,Twitter Web App,0,0
@HillTownTrader1 @RepDavidTrone Yeah I wish people didn't have to rely on the gov't for food. If Republicans would let us ⬆️ the minimum wage maybe fewer people would need SNAP which is a good thing.  Instead they refuse to raise the wage &amp; then they cut SNAP funding.

Finally. Although it‘s taken 3+ years for the Trump Adm to listen to Congress its decision today to impose #GloMag sanctions on those orchestrating human rights abuses against #Uyghurs &amp; other ethnic groups is welcome.

This decision is not a win for Democrats or a loss for Republicans.  It's a victory for the rule of law &amp; the basic American idea that nobody — from the President on down — is exempt from following the rules. https://t.co/mhNl5MNsCs,2020-07-09 15:23:51,Twitter Web App,16,101

This #Pride I'm proud to finally live in a country where #LGBTQ+ Americans can't be fired from their job because of who they are or who they love. ❤️💚💛🧡💙💜  Next up I nominate @repmarkpocan Co-Chair of the @LGBTEqCaucus for the #HousePrideChallenge! https://t.co/Qh3NQOyPPB,2020-06-15 21:03:25,Twitter Web App,8,44
🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈 This is a HUGE win for equality! 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈  The Supreme Court of the United States just ruled that firing someone for being LGBTQ violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.  Today we celebrate. Tomorrow the work goes on. https://t.co/cQ3AXSWecA,2020-06-15 14:40:22,Twitter Web App,17,105

Happy birthday to the Star Spangled Banner. Our flag is a symbol of the difficult work in front of each and every one of us: to build a more just and perfect union for all Americans. It reminds us that we rise and fall together as one nation and one people. Happy #FlagDay! https://t.co/b6nSUD2iTz,2020-06-15 00:24:51,Twitter for iPhone,7,27
Trump is overturning regulations to protect #LGBTQ people from healthcare discrimination.  During #PrideMonth.  On the anniversary of the #PulseNightclub shooting.  In the middle of a pandemic.  The calculated cruelty of this administration is unconscionable. We will fight back. https://t.co/y3ldfztf9K,2020-06-12 22:58:27,Twitter for iPhone,35,68

4 years ago a gunman took the lives of 49 people at the #Pulse nightclub in the deadliest attack on the #LGBTQ community in U.S. history. My heart is with those who are grieving today.

I agree w/ @SenatorLeahy. The #ICC has been a vital tool promoting rule of law around the world. If there's evidence of corruption let’s see it. Otherwise this looks like yet another counterproductive attack on an int'l institution America helped create to promote peace &amp; justice https://t.co/tUGV7wHWGM,2020-06-11 20:48:41,Twitter Web App,11,52

School meals are just as important as a textbook or computer. Congress approved billions to replace school meals months ago and the fact that only 15% of eligible children receiving benefits is a disgrace.

@quilts4veterans It's not that we don't want to be reminded. It's not that we're afraid.  It's that statues glorify people &amp; the ideas they held. Naming things after people signifies they're worthy to be celebrated.  Why not celebrate those on the right side &amp; learn about the others in a book?,2020-06-10 19:48:10,Twitter Web App,1,1
@quilts4veterans Check my record. I've always supported our troops.  But we have a free choice now — we can name bases after people who defended slavery and committed treason doing so or we can name bases after the people who fought against them.,2020-06-10 19:45:06,Twitter Web App,1,5
@quilts4veterans I'm accusing the people these bases are named after of committing treason. Because they did.,2020-06-10 19:40:45,Twitter Web App,1,3

How much more can we lower the bar? This is a disgusting tweet.

Grateful to @TheBlackCaucus for leading the way on this legislation &amp; proud to be an original cosponsor of the #JusticeInPolicing Act.  We need to keep up the pressure.

From another June 6th 76 years ago today.  We celebrate a daring victory which turned the tide of the war.  We honor those who didn’t make it home.

@DMartel12 Nope. I've told Chinese leaders to their face I find their human rights violations to be offensive. President Trump signed my bill to hold China accountable for human rights violations into law in January. It’s one of several I’ve gotten passed to hold China accountable.,2020-06-05 21:26:54,Twitter Web App,1,6

If Trump had a shred of decency he'd say sorry to Mr. Floyd's family for his crude disrespectful comments.  It's more than the incompetence or lies. He is a morally bankrupt person who's trying to drag us down the drain with his failing presidency. https://t.co/MbCXmepEu2,2020-06-05 21:03:47,Twitter Web App,48,140

On the 31st anniversary of the #Tiananmen Protests Trump seeks to emulate China’s authoritarianism here in America.

There is no one answer to the pain &amp; anguish our country feels right now. But police militarization must be addressed.   I'm a cosponsor of the Stop Militarizing Law Enforcement Act &amp; I strongly support legislation to stop police militarization. https://t.co/3QGA6nANDC,2020-06-03 20:24:18,Twitter Web App,24,97
President Obama initiated a number of reforms to ensure that military assault equipment didn't end up getting used against American citizens.  President Trump to bipartisan opposition reversed those reforms in 2017. https://t.co/HqpG9SK4zt,2020-06-03 20:24:18,Twitter Web App,26,65
To be clear some of the equipment transfers are fine. Excess office furniture first aid kits commercial vehicles.  But why would our police departments need grenade launchers bayonets and armored assault vehicles?  These are weapons of war that have no place on our streets.,2020-06-03 20:24:18,Twitter Web App,23,101
Let's talk police militarization.  Right now there's a pentagon program that transfers excess military equipment to local law enforcement.  I think that's a terrible idea. In fact I'm one of only a handful of House members who voted against it last time it came up for a vote.,2020-06-03 20:24:17,Twitter Web App,127,710
Thank you @RepRaulGrijalva &amp; @RepDebHaaland.  We need answers. https://t.co/QnYWo85vyC,2020-06-03 17:30:38,Twitter Web App,14,42
Journalists are essential workers because our right to see what's going on in our own country &amp; hold those in power accountable is essential! Enough is enough stop attacking freedom of the press! https://t.co/5RHJkRQJX8,2020-06-03 17:00:20,Twitter Web App,24,68
We can't forget or forgive the GOP's spineless surrender of our constitutional rights to protect a president who wants to use our military against peaceful protesters.  It's as simple as this: our president is a bad person the people who empower him know it and they don't care. https://t.co/IByLH5MoYC,2020-06-02 23:58:35,Twitter Web App,31,74
Who the hell does Donald Trump think he is tear-gassing a peaceful protest so he looks tough for a photo op?  This crosses the line. Trump’s words &amp; actions are un-American &amp; outside the rule of law.  We need to take back our democracy before it’s too late. https://t.co/mBQDbj3T0V,2020-06-02 04:54:20,Twitter for iPhone,49,196
We need to channel our anger and outrage into action and change.

Yes we need justice. And yes we need accountability. But if we end there we‘ll be right back where we started not long from now.   We need to change the broken system that allowed this to happen in the first place. https://t.co/aXlFFyPedj,2020-06-02 02:44:33,Twitter for iPhone,11,51
If #GeorgeFloyd looked like me he’d still be alive today and that is as sickening as it is wrong.   Today In Worcester our community came together united in peaceful protest to demand an end to systemic racism in our country. https://t.co/rF2010XJVs,2020-06-02 02:44:27,Twitter for iPhone,23,169
This year #Pride comes at a time of great challenge for our country.   As we take pride in the LGBTQ Americans who fought for equality we must remember that progress is not inevitable.

A normal president would be trying to heal our wounds and unite our country.  Donald Trump is on Twitter fanning the flames of division and resentment.

Withdrawing from the World Health Organization during a global pandemic is just plain stupid.

And no the president didn’t “decide” to do $600 emergency increases. It’s Title II Section 2104 of the CARES Act &amp; Republicans tried to strip it out.,2020-04-15 03:57:36,Twitter for iPhone,4,17
Trump couldn't legally sign the checks so he put his name in the "memo" field.  Imagine the kind of sad egotistical person who would turn this awful crisis into an absurd campaign stunt by demanding their name go into the memo field of a check that was approved by Congress. https://t.co/RAvj8dwdpM,2020-04-15 02:08:21,TweetDeck,218,445

This year #BlackMaternalHealthWeek comes in the midst of a pandemic.

April 10th!  What. The. Hell. Were. They. Waiting. For.  We sounded the alarm. My colleagues &amp; I pleaded w/ the White House to USE the Defense Production Act (not just talk about it).  If they did we might have had millions more N95 masks by now. The incompetence is outrageous.,2020-04-13 22:46:48,Twitter Web App,21,66
When I say the lack of leadership at the White House is a disaster this is what I mean:  "On the evening of April 10 the @DeptofDefense received approval from the White House Task Force to execute the first DPA Title 3 project responding to COVID-19." https://t.co/dR6yAxg1Eb,2020-04-13 22:46:48,Twitter Web App,13,44

It's not surprising that America's racial disparities are reflected in our broken healthcare system. But it is outrageous and wrong.

Let it be remembered that in the middle of a public health emergency Trump continued rolling back environmental standards that were put in place to protect people's health and welfare.

The president says we're at war. When America goes to war we don’t have 50 different strategies. We have one coordinated response.

The president “invoked” the Defense Production Act but the White House still hasn’t used its full authority.

7/ Federal disaster aid will be distributed in part based on the findings of the 2020 census. We need an accurate count — so I joined a letter to @USCensusBureau Director Steven Dillingham asking what steps he is taking to ensure we count everybody. ⤵️ https://t.co/OYuE3RQBUB,2020-03-30 23:25:24,Twitter Web App,1,13

5/ I also introduced a new bill — the Ensuring Emergency Food Security Act — alongside Rep. @RosaDeLauro to help ensure that no one in America is left behind or left out during a national emergency. https://t.co/uQKOLmkHBw,2020-03-30 23:25:23,Twitter Web App,2,20
4/ Working families shouldn't worry about putting food on the table — especially during a national emergency. So I led a letter to @USDA demanding that they protect people who are struggling to buy food. https://t.co/uZ7NmTe0xF,2020-03-30 23:25:22,Twitter Web App,3,18
3/ Massachusetts needs a robust coordinated federal response to this crisis. So the day after my conference call our Congressional Delegation asked the @WhiteHouse Coronavirus Task Force to take urgent &amp; specific steps to help our state respond. ⤵️ https://t.co/LtR0Sp29zr,2020-03-30 23:25:22,Twitter Web App,3,18
2/ Before we had any confirmed cases of #COVID19 in #MA02 I organized an emergency conference call with health care providers to discuss whether or not they had the information tools and resources needed to keep our community safe. https://t.co/nE2XbpREiK,2020-03-30 23:25:22,Twitter Web App,3,15

The @SenateGOP cannot have it both ways. They can’t complain there isn’t enough evidence then turn around and pledge to block any witnesses from testifying.  Trials need witnesses and the American people need the truth! https://t.co/blETD32hEq,2020-01-29 21:42:02,Twitter for iPhone,40,123
The President tried to cheat. He tried to silence your voice at the ballot by pressuring a foreign government to get involved in our election. He will cheat again if he is not removed from office.   We must #DefendOurDemocracy. https://t.co/R1xw1Y7THc,2020-01-29 18:43:54,Twitter Web App,46,114

President Trump’s own former Chief of Staff General John Kelly now says he believes John Bolton’s alarming allegations.  Senate Republicans are out of excuses. With so much on the line America deserves a fair trial. America deserves witnesses. America deserves the truth. https://t.co/CAO3lprphO,2020-01-29 02:29:09,Twitter for iPhone,27,97

My bill reaffirms America’s commitment to the idea that human rights matter. That we care about the oppressed and stand with those who are struggling for freedom. That we have a moral obligation to do something when we see something that is not right. https://t.co/V0W66xIZT0,2020-01-29 00:45:11,Twitter Web App,88,214

President Trump is trying to kick hundreds of thousands of vulnerable people off SNAP by putting more bureaucracy between hungry Americans &amp; the help they need.  The House of Representatives is taking action to prevent his cruel SNAP cuts. My statement: https://t.co/9dOVpLScXK,2020-01-28 14:18:52,Twitter Web App,16,58

President Trump: "Drain the Swamp."  Also President Trump: 1 in every 14 Trump appointees has been a lobbyist. https://t.co/6SFPfnxiZy,2020-01-24 19:34:15,Twitter Web App,10,31
LIVE: House Managers are presenting day three of our impeachment case against Donald J. Trump.  The president didn’t just break the law—he tried to cover it up from Congress &amp; the American people. His unprecedented defiance of congressional oversight is a threat to our democracy. https://t.co/wqYdlYIP6B,2020-01-24 19:07:33,Twitter for iPhone,27,61
I call on the Burmese government to stop its campaign of denial and comply with the #ICJ ruling. My full statement here: https://t.co/GEyt7wj13x,2020-01-24 01:34:07,Twitter Web App,14,22
This @CIJ_ICJ ruling is very very welcome. For years the government of #Burma has treated the #Rohingya people with breathtaking brutality and indifference. Today the International Court of Justice said enough is enough. https://t.co/A8NDYkjWLZ,2020-01-24 01:34:07,Twitter Web App,22,38
OUTRAGEOUS: Trump’s @EPA is going to put your drinking water at risk by wiping out basic protections for wetlands streams and drinking water sources across the country.

We are at a fork in the road. Will we continue to be a democratic republic where nobody not even our president is above the law? Or will we become a land run by those who act like kings and queens as if the law doesn't apply to them?  The character of our country is on trial. https://t.co/AO6ExVQ1Ec,2020-01-22 19:34:22,Twitter Web App,23,125
Today on the 47th anniversary of #RoevWade we know abortion access is under attack: states blatantly passing unconstitutional bans courts being stacked against us threats to overturn Roe.  I won’t stop fighting to protect access to safe legal abortion — we refuse to go back! https://t.co/kmq4liOwcO,2020-01-22 19:11:22,Twitter for iPhone,8,26
It’s shameful that Senate Republicans are voting to cover up President Trump’s illegal acts and prevent a fair trial in the Senate.  We all know how President Nixon’s defenders and apologists are remembered — those who did the right thing and stood up to him are seen as heroes! https://t.co/BFIV7teUmF,2020-01-22 05:01:07,Twitter for iPhone,45,159
As we mark this somber anniversary we must redouble our efforts to fight for and pass a constitutional amendment that overturns Citizens United ends the dominance of big money in our elections and returns us to government of by and for the people.,2020-01-21 20:16:59,Twitter Web App,1,9
Our @HouseDemocrats majority was elected to restore trust &amp; transparency to Washington. That’s why we passed the #ForThePeople Act to curb dark money in our elections. I call on Leader McConnell to bring it up for debate — the Senate must stop being where democracy goes to die!,2020-01-21 20:16:59,Twitter Web App,2,15
#CitizensUnited opened the floodgates for a handful of rich and powerful individuals and corporations to pour unlimited amounts of money into influencing our politics — poisoning our democracy and drowning out the voices of everyday Americans.,2020-01-21 20:16:59,Twitter Web App,9,23
Ten years ago today the Supreme Court put our democracy up for sale with its disastrous Citizens United decision.   My full statement here: https://t.co/25gpNxftx7,2020-01-21 20:05:32,Twitter Web App,17,59
Today we honored the legacy of #MLK in Worcester Leominster &amp; Northampton.   But today can’t simply be a celebration of the past.
