The Senate has decided it’s OK to invite foreign interference in our election. This is an outrage!   For the sake of our country – all of us who care about our constitution and our right to self-determination – must fight back.,2020-02-05 21:33:31,Twitter for iPhone,2,12
Imagine a President...   - who addresses the nation with facts - not lies.  - who chooses hope over fear.  - who chooses courage over cynicism.

I knew that reforming our campaign finance system is supported by a large majority of Americans across every demographic.   I guess it’s popular among doggos too am I right @FirstDogBailey?   #FITN #WinWithWarren https://t.co/fr3cytSh1Q,2020-01-25 21:41:24,Twitter for iPhone,2,17

This is how you win campaigns. It’s not about fancy endorsements but it’s about the power of the people.   The power of individuals knocking on doors talking to voters is unmatched. Thank you to all who joined us in #Concord today! #FITN #WinWithWarren https://t.co/FfgbBDsgxQ,2020-01-25 18:11:00,Twitter for iPhone,3,14
Proud to join Larry who has continued Granny D’s legacy of working to end the corrupting influence of big money in politics.   + thank you Casey for being in this fight! https://t.co/FRbKtWjvoV,2020-01-25 16:14:04,Twitter for iPhone,4,10
With 17 days left until the #FITN primary it’s important now more than ever to contact voters who are still making their decision.

Got any plans tomorrow?   I'll be heading up to Concord NH (coming for you @NHforWarren!) with a bunch of @ewarren supporters from Central Mass. If you believe in big structural change then I hope you'll join us! #mapoli #FITN #WinWithWarren   https://t.co/wx6mHxDLPQ,2020-01-24 16:33:11,Twitter Web App,4,29
In order for anything to change we need to build a grassroots movement to elect candidates who commit to overturning Citizens United as a top priority.   I'm proud to partner with organizations like @StopBigMoney and @usapromise that work every day to make this change possible.,2020-01-21 16:03:33,Twitter Web App,7,21
That is why I have consistently offered two constitutional amendments that 1. limits the amount of $$ in our political system and 2. declares that corporations are NOT people.,2020-01-21 16:03:32,Twitter Web App,2,8
I could go on &amp; on about the corrupting influence of big money in our politics.   All I know is that we must end it once for all.   I believe that the power should lie in the hands of the American people not in the boardrooms on Wall Street.,2020-01-21 16:03:32,Twitter Web App,1,3
4. It's allowed industries like the gun lobby to spend an absurd amount of $$ to influence lawmakers on policy decisions.   For example the NRA spent $35 million of dark money in 2016 alone at a time when large majorities of Americans favor stricter gun control measures.,2020-01-21 16:03:32,Twitter Web App,1,4
3. 86% of all outside spending in federal elections over the last 30 years has occurred in the last 10 alone. (Center for Responsive Politics)  Let me repeat: 86% of ALL outside spending in federal elections over the last THIRTY years has come in the last TEN years alone.,2020-01-21 16:03:32,Twitter Web App,1,3
2. Since 2010 over $4.4 billion dollars was spent by outside groups according to the Center for Responsive Politics.   Nearly $1 billion of that was spent by unaccountable "dark money" groups - that's a billion with a B.,2020-01-21 16:03:31,Twitter Web App,1,3
What does this all mean?   1. The Citizens United decision helped to create what is called "dark money" groups which allows for any special interest to spend unlimited $$ in support of or against a candidate without disclosing their donors.,2020-01-21 16:03:31,Twitter Web App,1,3
10 years ago the Supreme Court opened the flood gates to unlimited &amp; unaccountable money in our elections through the disastrous Citizens United decision.   It's given undue influence to wealthy donors &amp; big money special interests &amp; bolstered corporate personhood.,2020-01-21 16:03:31,Twitter Web App,8,27
“Why should there be hunger &amp; deprivation in any land in any city at any table when man has the resources &amp; the scientific know-how to provide all mankind with the basic necessities of life?   There is no deficit in human resources.   The deficit is in human will.” #MLKDay2020,2020-01-20 13:52:48,Twitter for iPhone,3,25
As @ewarren says Washington works well if you’re well off or well connected.   It’s time to fundamentally shift the power structure in this country and put the power back where it belongs - in the hands of the people. https://t.co/rB2pvXMlPR,2020-01-20 13:41:14,Twitter for iPhone,2,10
