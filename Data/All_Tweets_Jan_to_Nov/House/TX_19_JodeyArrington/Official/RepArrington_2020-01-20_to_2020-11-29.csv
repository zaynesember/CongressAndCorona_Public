It’s now in the hands of our judicial branch to decide if there is sufficient evidence regarding claims of systemic fraud and error.    It will be resolved soon enough but we must get it right in order for our country to move forward.   (3/5),2020-11-21 16:47:49,Twitter for iPhone,0,10
In a constitutional republic rule of law - not the media not politicians nor anyone else with an opinion - is what matters in a contested election.

February 3rd 1959 - the day music died.  From his early days on the radio waves of a local Lubbock station to being played around the world Buddy Holly was an icon for the ages.  Today we remember the lasting impact our hometown hero had on WTX &amp; rock ‘n’ roll music everywhere. https://t.co/w448cIp6ah,2020-02-03 17:54:39,Twitter for iPhone,3,9

The stress &amp; strain working class families face is real but we must judge policies not by their intentions but their results.   In my district TX-19 the avg. family income is $41000. A 3% increase in payroll tax would cost them $1200/year that they don't have.  #FAMILYAct https://t.co/xXIKb9G9EY,2020-01-28 18:26:38,Twitter Media Studio,7,24

The American people are not well served by the baseless impeachment of @realDonaldTrump.  With this dangerous precedent every presidency is now susceptible to a weaponized impeachment.  This isn't good for the Republic - I'm not talking about Republicans - but our great country. https://t.co/HwJql6GRDQ,2020-01-27 00:50:51,Twitter Media Studio,25,121

I believe the tide is finally turning in the direction of #life.  I’m proud to support the #MarchForLife movement &amp; I’m proud to have supported every pro-life measure considered in the House chamber.,2020-01-24 14:07:56,Twitter Web App,11,47
Life at every stage is equally valuable equally precious. Not only in light of the constitution but in the eyes of God.  60 million lives have been terminated through the practice of abortion. Yet - even in the shadows of this darkness we can see rays of hope.  #MarchForLife https://t.co/Ue7vMqr8XS,2020-01-24 14:07:23,Twitter Media Studio,540,1601
We’ve increased the investment in the public good of environmental stewardship by $6 billion/year for the next 10 years.

On the 47th anniversary of #RoevWade it’s important as ever that we defend the unalienable rights possessed by all Americans. The unborn are entitled to life liberty &amp; the pursuit of happiness.

But what inspired me most about MLK was the way he chose to fight.    It was clear that his source of strength was his faith in Almighty God and his firm belief that love “never fails” (1 Corinthians: 13:8).   #MartinLutherKingJr #MLK2020,2020-01-20 14:56:06,Twitter for iPhone,1,10

Grateful for Dr. Martin Luther King an American hero &amp; his efforts to help us live up to our ideals as a nation that “all men are created equal”. https://t.co/0spYfWB65s,2020-01-20 14:54:59,Twitter for iPhone,5,18
