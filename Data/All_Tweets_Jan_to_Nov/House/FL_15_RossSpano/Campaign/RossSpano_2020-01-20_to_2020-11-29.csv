Today is Election Day! When you head to the polls remember who the true conservative in this race is- the one backed by the NRA National Right to Life and Florida Right to Life. Vote Ross Spano for Congress! 🇺🇸,2020-08-18 12:09:33,Twitter for iPhone,2,9
.@mattgaetz you’re lying to the voters of FL15 when you say I don’t support the President &amp; the Border Wall. YOU voted No on that bill the same way I did because it gave the President only a fraction of the $ needed &amp; it tied his hands on how &amp; where he could build it. #OMG https://t.co/cclARDQVIG,2020-08-14 22:31:12,Twitter for iPhone,4,15

This campaign is about #PeopleNotPolitics — and for good reason. Speaker Pelosi cannot say the same. Her willingness to take a GLOBAL PANDEMIC and turn its response into one of scoring long-term political points will forever be a stain on this nation’s response to #COVIDー19. https://t.co/1KyALH9RAQ,2020-03-23 21:08:23,Twitter for iPhone,24,24
