The expert testimonies presented today &amp; the data submitted for the record will clearly reveal the emergency 🚨 our #FL15 growers face.   However the growers in #PlantCity and across Florida can tell this story better than I or data ever could. 🚜,2020-08-13 13:53:56,Twitter Web App,3,3
This shows a conscious effort to drive #PlantCity growers out of business.... if a solution isn’t provided and fair-trade practices are restored the #FL15 strawberry industry could be wiped out within just a few years!,2020-08-13 13:53:41,Twitter Web App,3,2

Sadly it appears Mexico plans to double down on unfair trade practices. Subsidies for 🍓 &amp; other produce have increased in 2019 and 2020 and Mexico’s President #AMLO has openly stated he plans to ⬆ subsidies to MX producers &amp; plant “one million hectares of fruit and timber”,2020-08-13 13:52:52,Twitter Web App,3,2
Strawberry growers🍓have suffered hundreds of millions in lost sales and a 36% reduction in market share in the U.S. since 2000.   This is why I'm proud to fight on behalf of #FL15 growers to establish FREE but FAIR trade practices as President @realDonaldTrump promised! 🇺🇸,2020-08-13 13:52:17,Twitter Web App,1,1
This growth caused directly by subsidies from the Mexican government comes at the expense of growers in #PlantCity and across #FL. In the last 20 years Florida growers have lost between $1.1 and $2.2 billion in sales leading to nearly 40000 lost jobs in Florida. 📉,2020-08-13 13:52:02,Twitter Web App,0,0
This has caused the value of Mexican produce shipped to the United States to increase ⬆ by more than 500% and the value of Mexican strawberries imported into the United States to grow by more than 1600%. 📈,2020-08-13 13:51:50,Twitter Web App,1,0
These subsidies coupled with lower-cost labor have resulted in dramatic change in our agricultural economy. Since 2000 the amount of land in Mexico 🇲🇽 used for protected fruits &amp; vegetables has soared from approximately 300 acres to over 130000 acres!,2020-08-13 13:51:37,Twitter Web App,1,1

Our growers their families and our way of life in #PlantCity are under siege.

I commend President @realDonaldTrump on this national emergency declaration. This bold and decisive move enables local and state officials to obtain access to needed resources to contain the #coronavirus and protect all Americans. It’s the right thing to do. #FL15,2020-03-13 20:09:44,Twitter Web App,4,12
It’s common sense to incentivize employers to allow their employees to #telework to stop the spread of the #Coronavirus.   @RepTedBudd and I introduced a bill to do just that:  https://t.co/0uOg2KknOY,2020-03-13 14:51:10,Twitter Web App,3,6
