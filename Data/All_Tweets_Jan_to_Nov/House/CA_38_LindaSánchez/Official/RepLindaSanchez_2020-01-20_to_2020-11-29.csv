For the 75 percent of Latinx retirees that depend on Social Security for the majority of their retirement income maintaining that trust is a matter of survival.,2020-09-24 17:55:16,Twitter Web App,4,3
Doing so would cut off benefits in just a few years and undermine the central tenet of Social Security.  ❌It is not an entitlement.  ❌It is not a handout.  ✔ It is an earned benefit that every worker pays into.  ✔It is a sacred trust that workers make to their future selves.,2020-09-24 17:55:16,Twitter Web App,8,7

Families need real help and they need it now. Instead all they got was a cut to their unemployment benefits and a payroll tax deferral that no one asked for.

If President Trump is serious about solving this problem he should support the #JusticeInPolicing Act.,2020-06-16 18:08:12,Twitter Web App,4,9
This executive order is a bandaid for a broken leg.

@RepEscobar Mi amiga @RepEscobar tiene razón: el peligro más grande que enfrentamos es el propio presidente y sus facilitadores republicanos en el Congreso.

My friend @RepEscobar is right – the greatest danger we face is the President himself and his Republican enablers in Congress.  This administration's policies have been disastrous for Latino families. We deserve better.    https://t.co/dQsZSRjxje,2020-02-05 18:10:09,TweetDeck,11,46

Protecting coverage for those w/ pre-existing conditions &amp; lowering RX prices are things we can all agree on.

Before the #ACA patients and survivors could be dropped denied or charged more for health insurance.
