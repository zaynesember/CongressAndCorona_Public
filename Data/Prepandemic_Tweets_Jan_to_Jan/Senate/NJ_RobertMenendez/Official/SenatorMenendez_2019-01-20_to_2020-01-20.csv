Our National Flood Insurance Program is broken. The path to fixing it will not be easy but #NFIPRe could create long-term change.  We’ve all heard stories like Doug’s.

Affordability is my #1 priority. #NFIPRe cuts the cap on premium increases in half &amp; provides assistance to low-and-middle-income homeowners in NJ. It sets aside hundreds of millions of 💰 to improve flood control.  Let’s be real—prevention is a lot more affordable than repair.,2019-10-28 17:43:46,Twitter Web App,4,12
Sadly Doug’s story is too common. That’s why I’ve been fighting for bipartisan legislation to reform the entire flood insurance system.  With the #NFIPRe Act we can hold insurance companies accountable and prevent abusive practices. https://t.co/OYHEORiv5Z,2019-10-28 17:43:45,Twitter Web App,8,13

Es lamentable que los Republicanos en el Senado intentaran hoy nuevamente aprobar un #TPS4Venezuelans con la condición de reformar *todo* el sistema del TPS.

This is what standing up for America’s values and ideals looks like.  Ambassador Yovanovitch is to be commended for her service and patriotism and for her defense of a critical national security institution the Department of State under attack from the Trump administration. https://t.co/ReSgcaTSVN,2019-10-12 19:26:05,Twitter for iPhone,46,125

My heart breaks for the victims of yesterday’s hateful attack at a synagogue in Halle Germany.   This is yet another tragic reminder that anti-Semitism is never dead. We cannot be complacent.

All this chaos and destruction is a direct result of the President looking for a hollow win to fulfill a campaign promise.  At the behest of foreign leaders President Trump sold out our allies &amp; our long-term national security for his personal short-term political gain...again. https://t.co/1aa4pAisOB,2019-10-09 17:01:56,Twitter Web App,125,291
Today is a dark day.  American soldiers worked tirelessly to train and fight alongside the Kurds against ISIS.  Now President Trump is leaving our allies to die at the hands of the Turkish military.

As predicted Trump completely ignored the calls from Congress from human rights advocates from the realities on the ground and from the Kurds themselves.  To be clear only chaos &amp; havoc will follow. This is the second chance ISIS has been waiting for. https://t.co/HE0HinNZiJ,2019-10-09 16:59:23,Twitter Web App,91,145

Trump asked for a political favor in exchange for U.S. security assistance.  A whistleblower said Trump wouldn’t meet with Zelenksy until he “played ball.”  State Dept officials carried out the President’s wishes with a foreign government.,2019-10-04 16:10:14,Twitter Web App,5,22
Trump tried to use U.S. foreign policy and taxpayer dollars to manufacture opposition research on a political opponent.  I have two questions: 1️⃣ Did anyone say “No”? 2️⃣ When will Republicans say “enough”?,2019-10-04 16:10:14,Twitter Web App,7,9

Pres. Trump knows there is no defense—constitutional or otherwise—for his actions. He’s stopped pretending he didn’t do it. Now he’s trying to convince Americans that this is normal.

@senatemajldr The world will not forget #JamalKhashoggi. There will be freedom of expression and respect for human rights in Saudi Arabia.  And here in Congress we will continue to demand accountability press for justice and work to restore the integrity of our foundational institutions.,2019-09-30 15:26:51,Twitter Web App,11,25
Trump has repeatedly vetoed Congress’ efforts but we remain undeterred.  In July SFRC approved my Saudi Arabia Accountability &amp; Yemen Act to sanction those responsible for Khashoggi’s death.  It's now up to @senatemajldr to let the full Senate vote on this bipartisan bill.,2019-09-30 15:19:03,Twitter Web App,6,19
Congress was forced to act.  @SenBobCorker and I triggered sanctions via the Global Magnitsky Act.  The Senate unanimously condemned Khashoggi’s murder. Congress passed measures to end U.S. military support for Saudi intervention in Yemen &amp; to block weapons sales.,2019-09-30 15:19:02,Twitter Web App,5,17
As the rest of the free world sought answers about Jamal Khashoggi’s death Trump betrayed the moral leadership we expect from a U.S. president…  ...all to help the Saudis cover up a murder. #JusticeforJamal,2019-09-30 15:04:08,Twitter Web App,12,20
