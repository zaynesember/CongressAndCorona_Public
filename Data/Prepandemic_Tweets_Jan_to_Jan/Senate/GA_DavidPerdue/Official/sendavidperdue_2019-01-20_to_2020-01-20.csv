It’s clear this fight has nothing to do with Puerto Rico funding. For Democrats this is about obstructing the president &amp; preventing him from keeping his promise to help the American people recover after hurricanes tornadoes &amp; wildfires ravaged their communities.,2019-04-19 16:13:03,Twitter for iPhone,8,28
As a result Puerto Rico is set to receive three times more funding than Texas did for Hurricane Harvey in 2017 and nearly double what was appropriated for Hurricane Sandy in 2013.,2019-04-19 16:12:21,Twitter for iPhone,8,18
President @realDonaldTrump has already approved $41 billion in combined disaster aid for Puerto Rico after Hurricanes Irma &amp; Maria hit the Island. He has also made an additional $50 billion available to Puerto Rico going forward.,2019-04-19 16:11:43,Twitter for iPhone,7,7
Now Dems have started a campaign of manufactured outrage &amp; have purposely misled Americans for their own political gain.

Democrats voted against a $13.6 billion disaster aid package because they said Republicans were unwilling to provide adequate funding for Puerto Rico. That is absolutely ridiculous.

Puerto Rico has already received billions of dollars in federal disaster aid. How much aid have farmers in the Southeast received after Hurricane Michael? NOT ONE DIME.   Democrats are holding our farmers hostage right now for their own political gain. It’s unacceptable.,2019-04-02 03:11:12,Twitter for iPhone,259,567
Don’t be fooled – Senate Democrats are using the people of Puerto Rico as pawns in their political game.

This bipartisan disaster relief package is a win for our farmers it's a win for families and businesses who were devastated by historic hurricanes in the Southeast and wildfires in the West and it's a win for the people in Puerto Rico who the President has previously helped.,2019-03-27 02:58:00,Twitter for iPhone,7,9

It’s unacceptable that Washington’s intransigence continues to threaten the livelihoods of the very people who sent us here to represent them.,2019-03-27 02:57:58,Twitter for iPhone,4,12
Disaster aid should have been funded as soon as we had an estimate of the damage which was just a few weeks after the hurricane hit. Instead disaster aid got caught up in a partisan spending battle and in typical Washington fashion Congress kicked the can down the road.,2019-03-27 02:57:55,Twitter for iPhone,5,10

Enough is enough. GA &amp; other states are hurting from historic hurricanes &amp; devastating wildfires and the federal gov’t continues to drag its feet.

I am deeply disappointed that Congress still has not addressed disaster relief funding for GA &amp; other states that were devastated by hurricanes &amp; wildfires last year.

Today Congress took action to address the national security crisis at our southern border. This bipartisan solution is a step in the right direction &amp; allows @POTUS to better secure the most dangerous &amp; heavily-trafficked areas along the U.S.-Mexico border.,2019-02-15 02:12:44,Twitter for iPhone,11,75
