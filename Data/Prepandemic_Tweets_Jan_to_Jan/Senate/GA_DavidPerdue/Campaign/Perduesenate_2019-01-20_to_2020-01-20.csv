186 continuing resolutions.   21 government shutdowns.   No consequences for politicians failing to get the job done.   It's time to change Washington's broken funding process. https://t.co/5W3WReZNk8 #gapol,2019-06-13 19:48:24,TweetDeck,4,11
Congress can and should do better. Changing this broken funding process is a critical step to tackling the $22 trillion national debt crisis. We will not solve this debt crisis until and unless we fix our broken funding process. #gapol,2019-06-12 17:39:01,Twitter Web Client,3,8
Fifth it will require the Senate Budget Committee to produce a five-year bipartisan plan every two years. The plan will include targets for the ratio of public debt-to-GDP discretionary spending mandatory spending and federal revenues.,2019-06-12 17:39:01,Twitter Web Client,1,6
Second it will match the fiscal year w/ the calendar year &amp; end “vote-a-rama.”  Third the funding agreement will only require 302a allocations to set top-line spending levels for each two-year period.  Fourth it will make the funding agreement a law instead of a resolution.,2019-06-12 17:39:01,Twitter Web Client,2,4
The Fix Funding First Act will do five things:  First it will impose consequences on Members of Congress for failing to get the job done on time such as “No Funding No Recess” and “No Funding No Pay.” #gapol,2019-06-12 17:39:00,Twitter Web Client,2,4
That’s completely unacceptable. We need a politically neutral platform that funds the government on time every year. The only way to get there is with real consequences for Members of Congress if they don’t get the job done. We also need structural changes to the process.,2019-06-12 17:39:00,Twitter Web Client,2,4
Congress has only funded the government on time four times since the Budget Act of 1974 became law and the last time was in 1996.   On top of that Congress has kicked the can down the road with 186 continuing resolutions and allowed 21 government shutdowns.,2019-06-12 17:39:00,Twitter Web Client,2,4

It shouldn’t have taken 8 months to pass this disaster relief package. This should serve as a lesson for both sides of the aisle. Disaster relief must never be a partisan issue.

Federal agencies like the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Department of Housing &amp; Urban Development are responsible for disbursing disaster relief funds after it’s allocated by Congress. #gapol,2019-06-04 14:10:33,Twitter Web Client,1,2

There are three actions Congress should take right now to ensure the gov't can provide relief in times of crisis.   First: Establish a reserve fund.

If Democrats refuse to come to the negotiating table to tackle the national security crisis at our southern border over the next few weeks @POTUS will do what is necessary to protect America.,2019-01-25 20:29:04,TweetDeck,6,11
Many Democrats have previously supported border security. Unfortunately throughout this process they’ve clearly demonstrated they want to keep immigration a political issue instead of working towards a real solution.,2019-01-25 20:27:22,TweetDeck,7,20
President @realDonaldTrump has put forward a reasonable plan to fully fund the federal gov't and also address critical border security and disaster relief.   Unacceptable that Democrats continue to reject every chance to compromise in good faith.,2019-01-24 20:50:21,TweetDeck,36,83

It's past time to hold Congress to the same standard as people who work in the real world. Work with a sense of urgency stay until the job is done and face tough consequences for failure. Period. https://t.co/y5FHqYyhCe #MakeCongressWorkAgain,2019-01-22 22:39:09,Twitter Web Client,12,29
Dr. King often reminded us that what unites us is far greater than what divides us. Though we may talk differently look differently or have different political views he would remind us we are one nation under God. #MLKDay,2019-01-21 19:13:51,Twitter Web Client,2,5
Dr. King gave us hope during some of our country’s darkest days. He changed America forever. Our country has overcome a lot but there is much yet to be done. We need to reflect on the ideals of Dr. King – the things he fought for the things he died for. #MLKDay,2019-01-21 19:13:51,Twitter Web Client,2,5
