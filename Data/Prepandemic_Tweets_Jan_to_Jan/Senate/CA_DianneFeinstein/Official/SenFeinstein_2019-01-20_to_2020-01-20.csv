Happy Pride San Francisco! Enjoy this weekend’s celebration of the progress we’ve made in the 50 years since Stonewall. We still have work to do. But this community’s resilience and grit is proof that we won’t stop working until all Americans have full equality.,2019-06-29 19:19:00,TweetDeck,119,826
War with Iran is in nobody’s interest. It’s time for the administration to take a different tact by dropping its hostile rhetoric and engage in immediate diplomacy. https://t.co/NnSMVgSZUI,2019-06-28 20:12:29,Twitter Web Client,49,195
The administration’s bellicose approach toward Iran has failed to produce any tangible results. Iran’s response by shooting down an American drone attacking oil tankers &amp; getting closer to violating its obligations under the nuclear agreement is also unproductive &amp; dangerous.,2019-06-28 20:12:29,Twitter Web Client,33,122
It’s disappointing that while a majority of the senators present cast their votes to reclaim our constitutional prerogative and block an unauthorized attack on Iran the amendment failed today.,2019-06-28 20:12:29,Twitter Web Client,102,290
Equality isn’t a partisan issue it’s a defining characteristic for our country. It’s something that should be above party politics.

From allowing health care workers and adoption agencies to openly discriminate against LGBT+ Americans to arguing that employers should be able to fire employees based on sexual orientation or gender identity this administration has consistently attacked the LGBT+ community.,2019-06-28 19:05:50,Twitter Web Client,10,104
#Pride may be coming to a close this weekend but we have many challenges ahead in the fight for LGBT+ rights. Recent actions taken by this administration are added cause for concern. https://t.co/V6mhUG5iFd,2019-06-28 19:05:50,Twitter Web Client,20,130

Fifty years ago Marsha P. Johnson Sylvia Rivera and the rioters at the Stonewall Inn rose up and ignited a movement for LGBT+ equality.

Many parents have had success treating their children with CBD oil particularly for epilepsy but current regulations make medical marijuana research difficult.

I hope the administration will abandon this partisan endeavor and instead work with Congress and the states to maximize responses to the census to ensure a fair and accurate count of everyone living in the United States. https://t.co/xv8WYP5ksb,2019-06-27 20:18:49,Twitter Web Client,17,73
Such a result would affect everything from voting representation to federal funding for infrastructure schools and safety-net programs which would be particularly harmful to diverse states like California.,2019-06-27 20:18:49,Twitter Web Client,11,67
I’m concerned what that will mean for future rulings. The Constitution calls for an accurate count of ALL individuals living in the U.S.. A Census Bureau report found that adding the citizenship question could result in an up to 8 % undercount.,2019-06-27 20:18:49,Twitter Web Client,5,24
I’m pleased the Supreme Court rejected the administration’s rationale for adding a citizenship question.

We’ve introduced two bills that would end family separation: the Keep Families Together Act and the Protecting Families and Improving Immigration Procedures Act.

According to the Trump administration it has separated more than 700 children from their parents between June 2018 and May 2019. This policy is cruel and unnecessary.

It’s also clear that this is unconstitutional. Congress appropriates funds not the president.

The reason President Trump said he didn’t need to declare an emergency is because there is no emergency. Border crossings are at their lowest levels in years.

Chairman Graham said he wants to protect senators’ role in nominations. The best way to do that is the blue-slip tradition. When a Democrat was president Republicans strongly defended blue slips &amp; Democrats honored them. That shouldn’t change because a Republican is president. https://t.co/qfuK55U9OC,2019-01-31 17:05:47,Twitter Web Client,1197,3273
.@SenKamalaHarris and I even identified candidates selected by the White House we could support to demonstrate our willingness to work cooperatively. Unfortunately the White House is moving forward with three nominees to a circuit court who have no judicial experience.,2019-01-31 17:05:46,Twitter Web Client,1120,2749
I am deeply disappointed that the White House has chosen to re-nominate Daniel Collins and Kenneth Lee to the Ninth Circuit. We made clear our opposition to these individuals and told the White House we wanted to work together to come to consensus on a new package of nominees.,2019-01-31 17:05:46,Twitter Web Client,6560,21355
I had the good fortune of meeting with the Illumination Foundation to discuss the work they’re doing in California to provide beds for the homeless.

Democrats remain concerned about whether Bill Barr would allow Congress and the American people to view any report submitted by Special Counsel Mueller in its entirety.

The #LillyLedbetterFairPayAct was a landmark bill in the fight against gender discrimination. 10 years later the pay gap persists. On average women make just 80 cents for every $1 a white man makes.

New research showing how the long-term effects of gun violence take a toll on victims and our health care system. It’s clear that gun violence is a national health crisis.

Congress passed our bill to pay back 800000 federal workers for the two paychecks they missed during President Trump’s shutdown. Now we’re working to ensure they receive that back pay immediately.

Now that the shutdown is over federal employees will get back pay but unfortunately it’s not guaranteed for federal contractors many of whom live paycheck to paycheck. That’s not right.

Federal workers have now missed two paychecks due to the president’s shutdown. With no end in sight many will need to start paying out-of-pocket for the full cost of their vision and dental insurance after they miss a third paycheck.

Roger Stone is the latest individual in President Trump’s circle to be charged with obstruction of justice &amp; lying about the campaign’s connections to Russia and Russian interference in the 2016 election.

Yet another sign that climate change is real and demands action.

A top Trump official today said he doesn’t know why federal workers who are going unpaid must rely on food banks. That lack of understanding is a BIG problem.

Federal employees their families and their communities shouldn’t be used as pawns. We can’t continue to ask federal workers to be furloughed or work without pay every time the president doesn’t get his way.

Allowing transgender individuals to serve has no negative effect on the military’s mission readiness. Our military is stronger when all Americans are allowed to serve openly and proudly.
