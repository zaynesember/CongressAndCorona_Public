The vaping public health crisis did not emerge overnight. E-cigarette manufacturers like JUUL have aggressively pushed their products to young people through sophisticated and comprehensive marketing campaigns.

As a member of the Armed Services &amp; Foreign Relations Committees I know what this military aid means to Ukraine. Without it Russia could have gone further &amp; killed more innocent people.

The Kremlin is once again interfering in our domestic politics by punishing a U.S. Senator for attempting to have a bipartisan dialogue with Russian lawmakers. This proves yet again that Putin isn't interested in dialogue or improving the situation of the Russian people. https://t.co/sl9a6gDfMy,2019-08-27 20:40:46,Twitter Web App,11,21
Rather than rush to do the bidding of the Kremlin President Trump should be holding Putin accountable and strengthening trade and diplomatic relationships with our G7 allies.,2019-08-27 19:55:36,Twitter Web App,9,33
President Trump advocating for Russia's reinstatement in G7 is nothing short of capitulation &amp; the US gets nothing from this. It's a bad deal for the US &amp; for the transatlantic community especially as the Kremlin continues to attack democratic institutions throughout the world.,2019-08-27 19:55:35,Twitter Web App,19,54
While a coordinated sanctions effort stemmed an even greater crisis the Kremlin continues to violate Ukraine’s sovereignty and sow chaos. It should remain suspended from the G7 until their aggression ceases. https://t.co/8Dm6yYzIp4,2019-08-27 19:55:35,Twitter Web App,5,30
Vaping poses serious risks to the health of young people.

Instead of “paying for themselves” as some Republicans promised Trump’s tax cuts have exploded the federal deficit.

My bipartisan bill the Insulin Price Reduction Act would roll back over a decade of insulin price hikes so Americans can afford the lifesaving medication they need.,2019-08-22 20:18:11,Twitter for iPhone,11,24
According to a @CDCgov survey nearly 1 in 7 Americans with diabetes ration or even forego their insulin due to its skyrocketing cost. This is an emergency that Congress needs to address immediately.  https://t.co/BGRlKL7QRG,2019-08-22 20:18:11,Twitter for iPhone,12,30
Though this is a step in the right direction much more work remains. That's why I introduced the bipartisan Fentanyl Sanctions Act to hold China accountable for cracking down on fentanyl traffickers. Congress must move quickly to ensure this legislation is passed.,2019-08-21 22:11:39,Twitter for iPhone,8,16
Glad the administration is heeding our calls in Congress and taking action against criminal fentanyl traffickers who have poured gasoline on an already raging crisis in communities in NH and across the country. https://t.co/TTjOTIGJ7O,2019-08-21 22:11:38,Twitter for iPhone,9,18
Despite the progress that has been made by the ACA Republicans continue their sabotage of the law. Republicans should be working with Democrats to deliver more affordable health care to all Americans not cutting off access to those who need it most.,2019-08-21 21:46:22,Twitter for iPhone,7,27
The facts don’t lie: the expansion of Medicaid has been critical in efforts to turn the tide against the substance use disorder epidemic allowing millions to receive lifesaving treatment from health care providers in New Hampshire and across the nation. https://t.co/Uxp27jQFio,2019-08-21 21:46:21,Twitter for iPhone,8,31

By refusing to provide certifications demonstrating the Saudi-led coalition is taking steps to reduce the horrific violence in Yemen the Trump admin is brazenly violating the bipartisan law I authored w/@SenToddYoung &amp; sidestepping congressional oversight.https://t.co/5XybvHCyzu,2019-08-19 21:12:38,Twitter for iPhone,13,20

Ellen Tauscher broke down barriers for women in a man's world - on Wall Street and in Congress. Her skilled diplomacy and tough no nonsense leadership helped make America and the world a safer place.

We must act as responsible stewards of our forests waterways &amp; wildlife refuges.

This report further underscores the need to stop fentanyl – the main cause of overdose deaths in NH – at its source.

The public deserves answers about any DOD role in weakening PFAS cleanup efforts. DOD officials told me they were not pressuring the EPA to adopt a lower contamination standard yet news reports suggest otherwise.

My thoughts are with the Jewish community in Poway CA following the attack during Passover. We can’t become numb to this awful violence fueled by hate. We must continue to stand united as a country and forcefully condemn anti-semitism and gun violence.,2019-04-28 14:20:10,Twitter for iPhone,12,62

We cannot afford to take a step backward on addressing PFAS contamination which has impacted communities in New Hampshire and many throughout the nation. No American should ever question the safety of their drinking supply.,2019-04-26 14:40:15,Twitter Web Client,12,25
In fact Acting Secretary Shanahan followed up with me earlier this month to reaffirm that DOD “takes its cleanup responsibility seriously” &amp; is “not seeking a different or weaker cleanup standard…” Read that response in full here: https://t.co/u0iqrBB3Y0,2019-04-26 14:40:14,Twitter Web Client,10,14
I questioned Acting Secretary Shanahan on this very concern recently during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing. https://t.co/SMFj1DZVpd,2019-04-26 14:40:13,Twitter Web Client,3,4
If reports are true that the DOD pressured the EPA to weaken PFAS cleanup standards this is wholly unacceptable &amp; is inconsistent with assurances that Acting Secretary Shanahan gave me on the Pentagon’s commitment to address PFAS contamination. https://t.co/uRGtE0xHXx,2019-04-26 14:40:13,Twitter Web Client,16,31

The domestic gag rule is rooted in a dangerous partisan effort to interfere in women’s access to reproductive health care services. It’s another assault by the Trump administration on women’s Constitutional rights.,2019-04-24 16:57:44,Twitter Web Client,1,4
This is welcome news. I’m relieved for the thousands of Granite Staters who rely on Planned Parenthood and other family planning clinics for their health care. The court’s action was urgently needed. https://t.co/u4S7FkKOto,2019-04-24 16:57:44,Twitter Web Client,13,60

As Special Counsel Mueller wrote: “The Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election in sweeping and systematic fashion.” We cannot allow this to happen again.

Nearly 200 charges against 34 individuals and 3 companies including 6 former Trump officials and 26 Russian nationals is much more than “a couple Facebook ads.” Any effort to downplay Russia’s interference isn’t just wrong – it’s dangerous for our democracy. https://t.co/YInLt2ajlW,2019-04-23 17:32:20,Twitter Web Client,102,238
