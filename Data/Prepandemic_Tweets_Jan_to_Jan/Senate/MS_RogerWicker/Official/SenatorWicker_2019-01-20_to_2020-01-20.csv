The #GreenNewDeal is not just expensive it is bad policy. It would raise energy bills eliminate air travel and require the replacement of 99% of all vehicles.,2019-03-04 22:28:52,Twitter Web Client,3,13
If enacted the #GreenNewDeal would leave American families on the hook for up to $65000 a year for 10 years. Nearly 90 percent of all American assets wealth and property would need to be exchanged to pay this hefty price tag. https://t.co/KVWRmBs0Xd,2019-03-04 17:46:29,Twitter Web Client,6,18
The #GreenNewDeal is perhaps the most expensive and economically disastrous legislation ever proposed. The total cost could be more than four times the annual value of all economic activity in the United States. https://t.co/fhU02nvQcP,2019-03-04 16:31:26,Twitter Web Client,29,83
