We need an Attorney General who will be fair and impartial in upholding our country’s laws—especially in regard to equal protection for all communities and a woman’s right to make her own health care decisions. William Barr would not be that AG. I cannot support his nomination.,2019-02-14 17:34:15,Twitter for iPhone,9,22
I’m voting against William Barr to serve as AG. His support of expansive executive power is alarming—especially at a time when we need an Attorney General who’ll stand up to the president when he’s wrong. The Senate should block Barr’s nomination.,2019-02-14 16:45:28,Twitter for iPhone,22,120
Navy CPO Shannon Kent was tragically killed while serving our country overseas. Before deploying she’d faced red tape in pursuing her goal to become a clinical psychologist for the Navy.

Franklin D. Roosevelt was one of the most influential leaders of our nation. Thousands travel to the Hudson Valley each year to visit his home so I’m excited that my bill to expand the Franklin D.

By capping SALT deductions the #GOPTaxScam hurt hardworking New York homeowners who play by the rules while gifting over a trillion dollars in tax cuts to the biggest corporations.

Working families need a real paid leave program like the #FAMILYAct which would guarantee 12 weeks of #paidleave for every American worker. https://t.co/4B2ZnJPldN,2019-02-12 22:34:06,Twitter Web Client,7,17

The U.S. remains the only industrialized country in the world that doesn't guarantee some form of #paidleave. It's time to fix it—and I'm proud to lead this fight once again with @RosaDeLauro alongside workers and advocates from across the country.   Let's pass the #FAMILYAct. https://t.co/gdPNXPOolT,2019-02-11 21:24:31,Twitter for iPhone,15,50

Following #SOTU I'll introduce new legislation to ensure that any transgender American who meets the standards can join our Armed Forces.,2019-02-04 15:21:41,Twitter Web Client,21,139
Transgender service members like Lt. Commander Dremann make extraordinary sacrifices every day to defend our freedom and most sacred values. President Trump’s decision to ban them from military service is cruel and undermines military readiness. #SOTU,2019-02-04 15:19:08,Twitter Web Client,22,137
Lt. Commander Blake Dremann is one of thousands of transgender Americans serving in our military with honor and distinction. He's been deployed 11 times and won the Navy’s highest logistics award.
