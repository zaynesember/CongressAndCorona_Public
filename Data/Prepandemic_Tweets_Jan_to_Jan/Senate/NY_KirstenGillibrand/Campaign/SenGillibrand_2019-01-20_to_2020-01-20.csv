The Women’s March was one of the most inspiring moments I’ve ever witnessed in politics. As women gather again for #WomensMarch2020—it's clear that this movement is growing.

This impeachment trial can only be conducted fairly if we can call on all relevant witnesses. If McConnell won't allow them it’s not a trial it’s a cover-up.,2020-01-16 22:02:50,Twitter for iPhone,528,3640
With the Senate impeachment trial set to begin I intend to uphold my constitutional duty to hold the president accountable—and try him on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.

This past November I introduced my War Powers Reform Resolution as a way to stop endless wars and curtail unchecked presidential power.

Congress needs to reassert its constitutional authority over our country’s military affairs before it’s too late. And we must pass my War Powers Reform Resolution which would restrain President Trump—or any future president—from unilaterally engaging in military actions.,2020-01-08 21:27:47,TweetDeck,86,518
This crisis was unnecessary and avoidable. President Trump has brought us to the brink of war with Iran. His actions have created chaos and could enable ISIS to regain power. He shouldn't seek further military action unless he notifies Congress and delivers a real strategy.,2020-01-08 21:18:13,TweetDeck,127,899
I’m greatly relieved no U.S. service members were harmed in Iran’s missile strikes. My thoughts are with our troops diplomats in the region and their families. The U.S. must embrace diplomacy &amp; work with allies in the region to deescalate these hostilities &amp; forge lasting peace.,2020-01-08 21:12:19,TweetDeck,22,220

As Congressional Republicans urge the Supreme Court to consider overturning Roe v. Wade we have to get loud and angry.

America’s founders gave Congress the power to declare war. They understood both the danger of giving any one person too much power and the fact that when war is waged it is the American people who bear the burden.

President Trump has made an impulsive decision to put us on a path toward another war in the Middle East.

Finally Congress must exercise its constitutional authority before it’s too late.

The president must notify Congress and seek authorization based on an explanation of the goals of military action adversaries and countries where our service members would be sent. The Trump admin should also brief Congress on any military plans and steps to safeguard Americans.,2020-01-03 21:15:17,Twitter Web App,28,211
Time and again this president has acted recklessly and without strategy escalating military risk breaking promises ignoring the precedent of the last two decades of war disregarding allies and throwing away our diplomatic wins.

Without Congressional authorization or a clear strategy President Trump has ordered military action that may precipitate armed conflict with Iran putting Americans at grave risk of retaliation by Iran and its proxies.,2020-01-03 21:15:16,Twitter Web App,29,156
Gen. Soleimani was directly responsible for the deaths of many Americans and our allies. But rather than making America and the world safer President Trump’s impulsive actions have instead moved us closer to war.,2020-01-03 21:15:16,Twitter Web App,161,1161

@getots @JeanneShaheen @TinaSmithMN @BarbaraBollier @SaraGideon @GreenfieldIowa Finally the path to flipping the Senate in 2020 includes kicking Mitch McConnell out of his Senate seat.

If we want to change anything in Washington we have to tackle corruption first—and the only solution is to get big unaccountable money out of politics. Our elected officials should answer to their constituents not the special interests.,2019-12-19 22:25:46,Twitter for iPhone,100,710
As we begin this impeachment trial we cannot enter the process as Democrats or Republicans but as public servants committed to finding the truth—and committed to holding the president accountable.

I'm deeply troubled by what I’ve heard from the House hearings. It appears President Trump put our national security at risk in order to obtain political favors.

The House will officially deliver Articles of Impeachment to the Senate.   Each senator has a Constitutional duty to consider the evidence marshaled by the House to make a fair dispassionate judgement on whether or not to convict the president.

Unlike the White House proposals my legislation the #FAMILYAct is comprehensive and would ensure every worker can take up to 12 weeks of paid leave no matter the caregiving needed. It’s an earned benefit it’s self sustaining and the idea is supported by a majority of voters.,2019-12-12 14:33:09,Twitter for iPhone,62,275
The U.S. needs paid leave. Badly. But the White House-backed proposals fall short of true paid leave and would do little to meet real needs of our families. Instead they'd require workers to borrow against future earnings or Social Security to cover today’s health emergencies.,2019-12-12 14:32:06,Twitter for iPhone,76,275
A few thoughts as the White House hosts their summit on “paid parental leave” today.   Despite a great deal of lip-service to the issue of paid leave today's event is nothing more than a photo-op.,2019-12-12 14:31:25,Twitter for iPhone,180,727

@getots For as long as I've been in public service I've been driven by the belief that we need more women at the decision-making table in our country.

@getots Watching us showed these girls that there’s no limit to what they can do if they put their minds to it—and if we show them we have their backs.

Women's bodily autonomy is the law of the land and I won't back down on that. https://t.co/dD2OtAOjJR,2019-08-19 19:56:22,Twitter Media Studio,294,1677

It's alarming enough that the president stokes racism and violence and coddles white nationalists.  But there's a group of people who won't call him out on it and who are refusing to give gun safety legislation a vote. They're Senate Republicans.

Al Franken faced eight credible allegations of sexual harassment. 34 other Senators called for his resignation but now I seem to stand alone.   I don't mind.

Our country deserves a new foreign policy—and a president who understands that leadership integrity and trust begin in the White House.,2019-07-24 20:02:53,TweetDeck,33,154
@ChicagoCouncil Trump’s lack of response to Russia's attack on our democracy is shameful. I believe Congress should begin impeachment proceedings to get to the truth. And I’m pleased to hear that Mueller believes that the president can be charged for a crime after he leaves office.,2019-07-24 20:00:41,TweetDeck,85,339
@ChicagoCouncil Our national security also includes online threats. It’s never been more clear that Russia took to the digital battlefield to attack the core of our democracy—and rather than stand strong for our country and our ideals Trump and his associates welcomed aid from Russia.,2019-07-24 20:00:17,TweetDeck,28,90
@ChicagoCouncil President Trump has politicized asylum seekers. Refugees leave their homes not because they want to but because they have to.   Supporting human and labor rights and addressing climate change will strike at the root causes of refugee flow terrorist support and instability.,2019-07-24 19:58:28,TweetDeck,20,97
@ChicagoCouncil America is stronger when we work with our allies—not abandon them.  Case in point: Trump’s tantrum on the nuclear agreement resulted in Iran beginning to enrich uranium again. As president I will rejoin our allies in the JCPOA as long as Iran agrees to comply.,2019-07-24 19:54:37,TweetDeck,15,97
@ChicagoCouncil We must end our endless wars. Military force should only be a last resort—only used when diplomacy has failed. We must have clear achievable goals where our tactics match the threat and only when Congress provides the legal authority to send our men and women into harm’s way.,2019-07-24 19:49:09,TweetDeck,15,81
@ChicagoCouncil As president I will restore our standing on the world stage and improve our country’s national security.  We must protect Americans with precision technology and a strategy that recognizes the threats of the 21st Century.,2019-07-24 19:41:59,TweetDeck,16,83
@ChicagoCouncil I’ll say this as loudly and clearly as I can: From his campaign’s conspiring with Russia to his reckless confrontation with Iran the President of the United States is degrading our standing in the world and making us a less secure nation.,2019-07-24 19:39:01,TweetDeck,69,326
From unauthorized wars to terrorism and risk of a nuclear arms race we face myriad global threats. Our own president shouldn't be one of them.  We need real leadership and real strategy. Watch live as I speak on national security at @ChicagoCouncil: https://t.co/edtyvFplHB,2019-07-24 19:35:40,TweetDeck,52,309
Americans can disagree about a lot but we should all be able to recognize that we can't afford four more years of Trump in the Situation Room.  I will restore our standing on the world stage and keep us safe. That's what a president should do. https://t.co/7GJQcQeHOS,2019-07-24 18:00:23,Twitter Web App,65,366
The American people have a right to see the full unredacted Mueller report. What we've seen already is alarming.   No wonder President Trump is dead set on blocking the truth. That's why we need to start impeachment hearings. Add your name if you agree: https://t.co/mhJRUyNj59,2019-07-24 15:42:02,TweetDeck,96,418
It's time to start impeachment hearings. https://t.co/YMHvUvDE7v,2019-07-24 15:00:02,TweetDeck,5646,33853
Today Robert Mueller testifies before Congress about his damning report on Trump’s collusion with Russia. One thing I already know: We need to get to the truth.  It’s time to start impeachment hearings. Sign on if you agree: https://t.co/mhJRUyNj59,2019-07-24 12:00:06,Twitter Web App,39,243

Yelena Grigoryeva was listed as a target of anti-LGBTQ violence. Then she was found dead.  Putin needs to be held accountable for the rampant persecution of LGBTQ people on his watch. And the U.S. president should defend human rights—not coddle dictators. https://t.co/GcnkSvpNEb,2019-07-23 22:56:24,Twitter Web App,180,488
The Senate did the right thing by passing the 9/11 first responders bill. I'm proud—but this isn’t a victory.   More heroes are going to get sick and die and each one is a tragedy. But today finally their government stood by them.,2019-07-23 19:54:27,Twitter Web App,140,1017
For-profit prison companies are contracting with our government to lock up immigrants immigration judges are reporting to Trump's DOJ and bail amounts are skyrocketing. The system is functionally and morally broken. https://t.co/TvXZDi66S5,2019-07-23 16:53:54,Twitter for iPhone,72,171
If we want to make health care a right if we want to combat gun violence if we want to take on fossil fuel companies and save our planet—we need to get money out of politics first. https://t.co/OuoJ6TKGDX,2019-07-23 14:32:27,Twitter for iPhone,122,499
Women won the 2018 election cycle. They organized turned out to vote ran and won in record numbers.   We should listen to women’s voices in our politics because they deserve to be heard—and we can’t win without them. https://t.co/QYgYE07QYZ,2019-07-23 02:18:33,Twitter Web App,87,433
"It shouldn't be unusual for a public official to stand and fight for the men and women who elected them—it should be a job requirement."  No one stands and fights like @wendydavis.

The hate coming out of this White House is sickening but it's a symptom—not the disease. We have to understand and dismantle institutional racism that holds whole communities back. And that burden can't be on people of color alone to bear. https://t.co/DemaAhqSci,2019-07-22 15:50:27,Twitter Web App,97,505
Americans need a president who will take on fights nobody else will—that's what I've done throughout my career. We're building a movement to fix what's broken and show that brave wins. Help power this campaign: https://t.co/65iA96dLz2,2019-07-22 15:12:55,TweetDeck,54,171

Abortion is already inaccessible for many. Overturning Roe would only put more people at risk and out of reach of health care which is exactly what Republicans are planning for. https://t.co/ecknIKPNkH,2019-07-21 18:04:40,Twitter for iPhone,101,374

50 yrs ago today we put a man on the moon. When President Kennedy made that our goal he didn't know if it was possible. He just knew we should try.  The Green New Deal is our moonshot.

No one thought I could win my first House race except my mother. My opponent never took me seriously. When I got to Congress people tried to tell me the fights I wanted to take on were impossible.

I went on the Trump Broken Promises tour to do two things: Highlight the broken promises Trump made to working families and prove that Democrats don't have to choose between firing up our base and winning back voters we lost. We can—and must—do both.  https://t.co/ygkmBK5qY4,2019-07-19 14:11:34,TweetDeck,49,241
We just found out: I can't wait to take the debate stage on Wednesday July 31!  I'll be at that podium because of grassroots supporters—but my spot for the fall could be in jeopardy.

When you speak I listen. I take notes. And then I do something about it. That's how public service is supposed to work.  In this democracy your voice should be just as important as the Koch brothers'. In my administration it will be. https://t.co/FhEuo8WNGO,2019-07-18 21:49:39,TweetDeck,71,410

Private equity firms strip down companies walk away with millions and leave communities hurting—and they've done it all with impunity. No more.

Whether it's "send her back" or "lock her up" "there has to be some form of punishment" or "grab her by the p***y"—the throughline is contempt for women and anyone who threatens this president's fragile ego.  He should be afraid. We are his worst nightmare. And we will beat him.,2019-07-18 02:10:55,Twitter Web App,12311,87746
This is absurd. If we did this sick responders would have to come back and do this all over AGAIN in a few years.   We need to permanently fund the Victim Compensation Fund. Period. https://t.co/9zfj0XVXYo,2019-07-17 23:52:03,Twitter for iPhone,284,1168
I am a person of faith and I believe Republicans have distorted the conversation about Christianity in this country.  President Trump is turning away people who are fleeing danger and need help. He's separating families and locking children up. That isn't Christian. It's evil. https://t.co/Nf3DJTcqNg,2019-07-17 22:33:14,Twitter Media Studio,460,2053
Remember: Rand Paul was happy to vote for Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell’s trillion-dollar tax handout to millionaires but he blocked my request for unanimous consent on the 9/11 first responders bill.,2019-07-17 20:36:22,Twitter Web App,12370,51222
This is unacceptable. 9/11 first responders are suffering and dying for their heroism and my Republican colleagues can't get it together to help them. I ask you: What are you even doing here? https://t.co/OLjMdb9drS,2019-07-17 17:47:02,TweetDeck,1157,5553
There are a lot of people in America who feel left behind. Nobody facing job loss or lack of health care feels privileged. But we have to address everyone's suffering—and that means ensuring black and brown families don't bear the burden of institutional racism alone. https://t.co/rFjkiNtsan,2019-07-17 16:29:09,Twitter Media Studio,60,256

Last week we drove from Pittsburgh PA to Lansing MI to share my plans to deliver results where Trump has failed.

Attacking something as basic and essential as Title X-funded health care shows the Trump administration will stop at nothing to try to control women's bodies.

President Trump said he was ten minutes away from starting a war with Iran—without ever asking Congress.  We need a real commander in chief. #DemDebate,2019-06-28 02:44:40,Twitter Web App,127,884
Imagine if our commander in chief brought a decade of experience on the Armed Services Committees instead of two years on Twitter. #DemDebate,2019-06-28 02:41:35,Twitter Web App,64,540
Paid family leave affordable child care universal pre-K and support for families—no matter who they are—in the first 100 days. #DemDebate https://t.co/YUJi64pIEz,2019-06-28 02:38:52,Twitter Media Studio,63,376
After every mass shooting NRA-bought politicians say nothing can be done to fix this epidemic.  In the words of @Emma4Change we call BS. It's time to put lives over money and end the gun lobby's chokehold on our laws. #DemDebate,2019-06-28 02:35:49,Twitter Web App,65,392
The Parkland kids should have as much power in our democracy as the Koch Brothers or the NRA. #DemDebate https://t.co/aztBlpJnHa,2019-06-28 02:32:29,Twitter Media Studio,106,692
We need to make sure a fierce fighter for reproductive rights is on every debate stage. Help us make sure Kirsten gets there: https://t.co/SWDAxD7fBD #DemDebate,2019-06-28 02:30:35,Twitter Web App,19,104
If we can’t guarantee things like universal pre-K or national paid family leave then we’re not setting families up to succeed. That means we’re failing. We need a Family Bill of Rights: https://t.co/SNfO7tHG4L,2019-06-28 02:29:39,Twitter Web App,61,214
Climate change is the single greatest threat to humanity that exists today and it will take a bold approach to even begin solving it. We can’t afford half-steps—the Green New Deal should be our moonshot. #DemDebate,2019-06-28 02:25:42,Twitter Web App,180,1217
Reproductive rights are nonnegotiable. Period. #DemDebate https://t.co/Flhs0qpaf6,2019-06-28 02:23:39,Twitter Media Studio,163,1149
Women deserve a president who won’t just defend their rights but one who will lead the fight for them. Kirsten was the first 2020 candidate to put out a comprehensive reproductive rights agenda and vow to only appoint judges who’d uphold Roe. https://t.co/GlLuho4J8U #DemDebate,2019-06-28 02:21:18,Twitter Web App,40,218
When we defeat Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell walks into the Oval Office—who do you want in that negotiating room?  Kirsten has been fighting fiercely for women’s rights for a decade. When that door closes she'll never compromise on women’s reproductive freedom. #DemDebate,2019-06-28 02:19:33,Twitter Web App,91,641
Special interests are at the root of almost all of our biggest problems right now—gun violence climate change unaffordable health care.

Donald Trump’s administration demonizing and mistreating asylum-seekers and funneling security funds into for-profit prisons doesn’t make us safe. #DemDebate,2019-06-28 01:44:56,Twitter Web App,53,231

Let’s not mince words: Separating children from their families in order to punish them for seeking a better life is cruel. This has to end. #DemDebate,2019-06-28 01:41:10,Twitter Web App,105,637
Immigrants and those seeking asylum should have access to lawyers not cages. People coming to our country should be met with compassion not walls. #DemDebate,2019-06-28 01:38:05,Twitter Web App,61,376
We desperately need compassionate humane immigration reform in this country. It starts with a pathway to citizenship. #DemDebate,2019-06-28 01:35:12,Twitter Web App,61,364
Health care should be a right not a privilege. That’s why Kirsten supports Medicare for All—and has since 2005. https://t.co/NNQQ3BMbdk #DemDebate,2019-06-28 01:32:01,Twitter Web App,39,163
We need to create a public option to let people buy in to Medicare for All at a cost they can afford. That’s how we transition from our current system to single-payer. #DemDebate https://t.co/Fh3xbVuOJF,2019-06-28 01:28:19,Twitter Media Studio,49,187

You’ll hear a lot of progressive ideas tonight. But we’ll never get them done if we can’t get the corrupting influence of money out of politics and break Washington gridlock. Kirsten’s Clean Elections plan would do it: https://t.co/9Ojiy7X3PJ #DemDebate,2019-06-28 01:12:36,Twitter Web App,35,105
Our economy is not an even playing field. Kids fall back because of their socioeconomic status race and zip code before they enter kindergarten. Kirsten's economic agenda centers on families and addresses institutional inequities. #DemDebate,2019-06-28 01:08:29,Twitter Web App,28,99
We're one of the richest countries in the world. To withhold health care from those who can't afford it is shameful. It's long past time for Medicare for All. #DemDebate,2019-06-28 01:05:30,Twitter Web App,69,381

I'm getting ready for the debate tonight and I can't wait to share my vision with the whole country.  With higher thresholds for the next debates I need to hit 130000 donors so I can keep lifting up the issues you care about. Can you be one of them? https://t.co/M2DkIwUul0 https://t.co/mmqDcI7iOW,2019-06-27 23:01:16,Twitter Web App,25,113
I come from a line of strong outspoken women. They raised me with the belief that bravery isn't just about standing up for yourself—it's about standing up for people who need you. Here's a little more of what they taught me. https://t.co/BZJXaFRIUI,2019-06-27 22:16:17,Twitter for iPhone,35,239
"A pledge that Gillibrand made earlier this year—to only nominate judges who commit to backing Roe v. Wade—has set the standard for nearly every other 2020 Democrat most of whom have followed suit."  And I'm glad it did. https://t.co/bQSE3Oj2J6,2019-06-27 21:04:50,Twitter Web App,51,411
When I started this campaign I said I'd fight for every family as hard as I fight for my own. And when it's your family you don't settle for half-steps. You dig deep and act boldly.  When it comes to making the future better for families I will fight. And I fight to win. https://t.co/f5liZOnn6J,2019-06-27 20:05:23,Twitter for iPhone,25,128

We deserve a leader who will take on the fights no one else will. Someone who's brave enough to stand up for what's right even when it's hard. Even when she stands alone.  That's what I do and that's why I'm running. https://t.co/A2RHDUCOvH,2019-06-27 18:00:25,Twitter Web App,19,155
Good. The citizenship question is intended solely to instill fear in immigrant communities. There’s absolutely no need to include it in the census.  https://t.co/BT3XvdPXqa,2019-06-27 16:49:11,Twitter Web App,53,283
This is a disgrace. Partisan gerrymandering guts the most sacred principle of our democracy: voters choose their representatives—not the other way around.  We can't rely on the judiciary to defend our values. We need Clean Elections and fair redistricting. https://t.co/d8PZe5H5wA,2019-06-27 14:35:38,Twitter Web App,327,1235

We can't stop climate change unless we take bold action and put a price on carbon. It doesn't matter what President Trump or anyone else says—saving our planet creating green jobs and protecting clean air and water should be bipartisan and a no-brainer. #DemDebate,2019-06-27 02:30:29,TweetDeck,93,520
Gun violence is an epidemic in this country—but we can’t end it unless we get money out of politics. Elected officials should answer only to the people they represent not the NRA and its greed. #DemDebate,2019-06-27 02:07:35,Twitter Web App,56,427
Seeking asylum is not a crime. #DemDebate,2019-06-27 01:48:07,Twitter Web App,459,3456
President Trump’s treatment of immigrants is inhumane and appalling. Separating families and detaining kids in horrifying conditions doesn’t make anyone safer. We need comprehensive immigration reform. #DemDebate,2019-06-27 01:45:53,Twitter Web App,69,487
All of the Democrats running support reproductive rights but the next president needs a plan to codify Roe v. Wade and protect access everywhere. That’s why I was the first candidate to put out a comprehensive reproductive rights agenda: https://t.co/GlLuho4J8U #DemDebate,2019-06-27 01:34:59,Twitter Web App,42,175
Health care should be a human right—period. But to make Medicare for All a reality the next president needs to be brave enough to take on the insurance companies create competition and get costs down. I’ll fight for it as president just like I have done since 2006. #DemDebate,2019-06-27 01:25:27,Twitter Web App,56,405

Families across America are struggling to make ends meet and their children are being held back as a result.

It's essential that our next president have a bold vision for this country—but none of it will be possible until we get money out of politics.

The coordinated assault on reproductive freedom has been underway for years and it's about one thing: undermining women's bodily autonomy.  We must be unequivocal in standing up for our civil rights. That includes electing a new president who will fight for them no matter what. https://t.co/bEwMQFRpvL,2019-06-25 00:11:41,Twitter Media Studio,68,333

Donald Trump has degraded our democracy and ripped apart the moral fabric of our country. In moments like this I believe we're all called to take on the tough fights—even if they are hard.

As with so many issues President Trump doesn't have a real plan when it comes to trade tariffs or the economy. He's hurting farmers and manufacturers.  Americans need a strategy—not a tantrum. #GillibrandTownHall,2019-06-02 23:45:52,TweetDeck,57,274

I'm going to be very clear: Reproductive rights are human rights and they are nonnegotiable.   That's why as president I will codify Roe v.

Why is it that too many of our leaders don't have the guts to stop gun violence? Simple: because they're bought and paid for by the NRA.

The NRA cares more about gun industry profits than human lives. We need to stand up to their greed not only by fighting for policies like background checks an assault weapons ban and anti-trafficking measures but also by getting money out of our politics. #GillibrandTownHall,2019-06-02 23:06:57,TweetDeck,249,1439

It's clear that a lack of respect for our Constitution is contagious in the Trump White House.

We're facing an unprecedented Republican assault on abortion access in states across the country.

In 2018 I flipped 18 Trump counties in NY. My 2012 vote share is the highest a statewide candidate has won in NY—ever.

We need a president who's brave enough to take on corruption in Washington. Americans have lost faith in our democracy because elected officials are more beholden to big donors and special interests than they are to the people.  My Clean Elections Plan would change that. https://t.co/C424hHz3pB,2019-05-02 21:01:40,Twitter for iPhone,106,432

I've been concerned about AG Barr since his nomination which is why I voted against it. After yesterday's hearing there's no question that he's more focused on representing the president than the American people.

By eliminating a current taxpayer subsidy for excessive CEO compensation—25 times the median salary of their employees or more than $1 million—we'd fully fund my Clean Elections Plan and then some.

It's clear the Trump Administration will stop at nothing to take health care away from tens of millions of Americans and end coverage for pre-existing conditions.

Not only do clean elections make candidates less beholden to big money but they amplify more voices in the process.

President Trump is tearing apart the moral fabric of this country. He demonizes the vulnerable and punches down. He puts his name in bold on every building.

None of these big fights will be easy. But I’ve never backed down from a fight for what’s right and I’m not about to start now.  That’s why I’m in this race. I'm running for president to fix what’s been broken repair our moral fabric and rebuild our common bonds.  #BraveWins,2019-03-24 17:50:40,Twitter for iPhone,55,198
We need to treat climate change like the existential threat it is and pass a #GreenNewDeal. Let’s make it our generation’s moonshot. Addressing a global challenge of this urgency will take massive effort and transformative vision—which is exactly why we should do it.  #BraveWins,2019-03-24 17:48:45,Twitter for iPhone,108,374
We must hold accountable any threats to our democracy.  The Mueller report must be made public. Nobody is above the law. I don’t often agree with Richard Nixon but he was right to say the American people have a right to know whether or not their president is a crook.  #BraveWins,2019-03-24 17:47:20,Twitter for iPhone,95,443
We need to restore our moral leadership in the world. We must secure our borders effectively and fight terrorism relentlessly but let’s be very clear: Racism and fear are not a national security strategy.  #BraveWins,2019-03-24 17:45:52,Twitter for iPhone,69,223
We need to dismantle institutional racism.   We need solutions both targeted and broad—like higher standards for maternity care a national commitment to full employment postal banking ending cash bail and legalizing marijuana.  #BraveWins,2019-03-24 17:44:48,Twitter for iPhone,56,218
Hear me when I say this: Paid leave equal pay and affordable daycare are not just “women’s issues.” These are economic issues—ones that will determine whether or not our country succeeds.   #BraveWins,2019-03-24 17:43:35,Twitter for iPhone,77,312
Our goals are ambitious but they shouldn't be controversial:  Medicare for all. Universal pre-K and high-quality public education. Affordable college. Full employment. A $15 minimum wage. National paid leave.  #BraveWins,2019-03-24 17:42:38,Twitter for iPhone,132,590
As president I will fight for publicly-funded federal elections. It would change the way Washington works overnight. Imagine your voice being just as loud as the Koch brothers—what a concept!  We have to level the political playing field so our democracy can thrive.  #BraveWins,2019-03-24 17:38:31,Twitter for iPhone,67,318
Right now special interests are displacing the voices of the people in our democracy. Find me a so-called unsolvable problem and I'll point you to the greed and corruption in the way.  We need to crack open our government flip the switch and let the light flood in.  #BraveWins,2019-03-24 17:37:25,Twitter for iPhone,50,225
I’m fighting for an America where where compassion and integrity define our government not self-interest and corruption. Where we don’t just care about the profits we make today but the future we’re leaving to our grandchildren.  I know we can be that America.  #BraveWins,2019-03-24 17:36:19,Twitter for iPhone,35,187
I stood up to greed and voted against the bank bailout.  I stood up to corruption in Congress.  I stood up to the Pentagon Congress and colleges on behalf of survivors of sexual assault.   And I’m proud to have stood up to Trump more than anyone else in the Senate.  #BraveWins,2019-03-24 17:35:03,Twitter for iPhone,93,537
My grandmother Polly taught me that being brave doesn’t just mean standing up for yourself—it means standing up for other people who need you.   Bravery means standing up to the powerful and summoning the courage to confront them head on. And that's what I've done.  #BraveWins,2019-03-24 17:33:12,Twitter for iPhone,59,262
Day in and day out Americans are making a choice to resist the backward pull of this administration and pushing us toward a better future.  The people of this country deserve a president worthy of your bravery. That's why I’m running for president.  #BraveWins,2019-03-24 17:30:45,Twitter for iPhone,31,176
We deserve a president who is brave. A president who inspires us to stand for something greater than ourselves.  We don’t build walls; we build bridges. Because our unity of purpose lifts us higher than any tower.  #BraveWins,2019-03-24 17:28:06,Twitter for iPhone,67,305
President Trump is tearing apart the moral fabric of this country. He demonizes the vulnerable and he punches down. He puts his name in bold on every building.  He does all of this because he wants us to believe he is strong. He is not. Our President is a coward.  #BraveWins,2019-03-24 17:26:00,Twitter for iPhone,1255,6548
Brave isn’t winning right now.  Brave doesn’t spread hate or bully the vulnerable.  Brave doesn’t put greed and self-interest over millions of lives.  Brave doesn’t cower behind lies and walls.  Brave doesn’t pit people against one another. That’s what fear does.  #BraveWins,2019-03-24 17:24:59,Twitter for iPhone,89,293

And tomorrow we'll put him on notice by standing up for our values and sharing our vision right in his front yard. Join us in NYC at noon ET: https://t.co/9CcwVZBXMz #BraveWins,2019-03-24 02:02:50,TweetDeck,150,720
When I studied abroad in China @conniebritton was right beside me. In our decades of friendship she's continued to inspire me as an activist to combat poverty and advance equal rights for women on top of her career as an actor. I'm so glad she'll be with us tomorrow. #BraveWins https://t.co/26RwNRkkZP,2019-03-23 23:07:15,Twitter for iPhone,21,221
Monica Sibri believes that representation matters and that’s why she’s fighting to elect young women and standing up for Dreamers like herself. Monica's being brave and showing her communities how to be brave too. #BraveWins https://t.co/GYdE6ZQ9me,2019-03-23 22:12:11,TweetDeck,33,178
When Annie Clark saw firsthand that colleges weren’t doing enough to protect students from sexual assault she filed a Title IX complaint to hold her school accountable—and won. Her bravery helped kickstart a national movement to end sexual assault on campuses. #BraveWins https://t.co/ltjQtnZjiP,2019-03-23 21:32:32,TweetDeck,43,204
Tanya Asapansa-Johnson Walker has embodied bravery in more ways than one—from serving in the US Army to serving marginalized transgender people to fighting for the rights of women LGBTQ people and the undocumented. I'm honored to have her with me tomorrow. #BraveWins https://t.co/0Mf22JHuZF,2019-03-23 20:53:25,TweetDeck,30,143
It takes extraordinary bravery for a sexual assault survivor to tell their story. Andrea Pino-Silva did and then she kept going. She helped lead a nationwide charge to combat sexual assault on college campuses by changing policies and empowering survivors. #BraveWins https://t.co/tohnvujbIm,2019-03-23 20:11:24,TweetDeck,38,175
Gabriel Blau has spent his career fighting so that all families are treated with respect and equality. Being brave means standing up for others in addition to yourself—Gabriel acts on those values. #BraveWins https://t.co/n7yPCtSxkA,2019-03-23 19:38:28,TweetDeck,33,154
Lisdy Contreras-Giron is a Dreamer in every sense of the word. She came to the US at 5 and now she's getting her law degree to help marginalized people. She uses her voice to advocate for equal opportunity for everyone no matter where you came from. That’s bravery. #BraveWins https://t.co/Qb2YLFkXjS,2019-03-23 18:26:07,TweetDeck,42,188
When Jackie Rowe-Adams lost two of her sons to gun violence she turned her unimaginable pain into action. She formed a group of moms and other safety advocates dedicated to ending gun violence in Harlem. Jackie chose to be brave and New York is better for it. #BraveWins https://t.co/D6oqnS1o7d,2019-03-23 17:17:39,TweetDeck,75,303

If we're going to make our economy work for families we have to transform the infrastructure of work to make it easier to be a parent AND make a living. We need equal pay for equal work affordable daycare for all and national paid leave. It's 2019. Let's get this done. https://t.co/jwTKNDFsjm,2019-03-23 15:00:28,Twitter for iPhone,55,302
Whatever Mueller's report contains here's what we already know: Trump has spread hate clouded truth sown division and undermined our democracy. On Sunday we'll send him a message that says: Your time is up. Join us at noon at Trump International: https://t.co/v6uTSq5Puy,2019-03-23 02:20:36,Twitter for iPhone,633,2012

America's students and graduates are already being crushed by student debt. They deserve a president who'll help lift that burden—instead Trump's proposed budget makes it way worse. Cutting student loan programs by $200 billion to help pay for millionaires' tax cuts is shameful.,2019-03-22 17:47:10,Twitter Web Client,323,1504

We need to pass universal background checks ban assault rifles and stop gun trafficking. We need to close gun sale loopholes to make sure guns can’t get into the hands of dangerous criminals terrorists or domestic abusers. And we can't let the NRA's greed stop us. https://t.co/NKL2AFoxTf,2019-03-21 19:59:01,Twitter Media Studio,194,834

Let's put aside the overreaching fake national emergency for a minute. How does Trump intend to pay for his pointless wall and tax cuts for millionaires? By cutting $845 billion from Medicare $26B from Social Security and $200B from student loan programs. It's all wrong.,2019-03-21 16:04:01,TweetDeck,834,3131
The best way to provide national paid leave is to make it an earned benefit just like Social Security. Under my plan you and your employer would each pay in $2/week and you'd get 12 weeks of paid leave. It's that simple. https://t.co/ur6CTdQnoU,2019-03-21 14:32:53,Twitter Media Studio,94,440

One of the many problems with Trump is Betsy DeVos. She's unqualified and unfit for the job and that's why I voted against her nomination.  The Department of Education needs to protect students not predatory lenders and sexual abusers. Enforcing Title IX shouldn't be optional. https://t.co/AboNbfg8nO,2019-03-20 14:45:15,Twitter Media Studio,544,2755
Congratulations to Iowa’s newest State Senator @EricGiddens4IA! Elections matter—can't want to see the great things he'll do in the Iowa Senate and bravo to the dedicated volunteers and supporters who won this fight for our progressive values. #SD30,2019-03-20 03:23:55,TweetDeck,84,452
I'm hard-pressed to think of any policy more cruel—and more hypocritical for a party that claims to have family values—than cutting lifelines for low-income children. We are not going to let kids go hungry so Trump can pay for his tax cuts for billionaires. https://t.co/htgO6ChYgD,2019-03-20 01:31:48,Twitter for iPhone,1025,3024
Student debt is one of the biggest crises we have in this country today. The federal government should not be making money off the backs of our students. https://t.co/CTliwr1Pag,2019-03-19 22:44:09,Twitter Media Studio,229,1008
Tens of thousands of Americans are killed with guns every year. Many are kids. There's no excuse for the NRA's chokehold on our laws; even gun owners want background checks. Someone has to protect the children of this country against the danger your greed puts them in. I will. https://t.co/pU0JIdV2eM,2019-03-19 20:43:14,TweetDeck,311,1816
What's happening at our border is inhumane and intolerable and it doesn't make us safer. These are refugees and asylum seekers. We need to secure our border in smart ways end family separation and create a real path to citizenship.  There is no such thing as an illegal human. https://t.co/igxhfylR3s,2019-03-19 17:46:21,Twitter Media Studio,427,1859
White supremacy and hate crimes are on the rise around the world. Donald Trump didn't create them but he has poured gasoline on that fire and his hate has made us all less safe. I refuse to let it go unchecked. I will stand up to him and I will fight for the best of our values. https://t.co/zge8aa2gf6,2019-03-19 14:26:29,Twitter Media Studio,355,1619

Donald Trump's hatred makes us less safe. His Muslim ban makes us less safe. So I will protect this country. I will make sure that we are safe but I will make sure that we remember that we are at our best when we love one another. #GillibrandTownHall,2019-03-19 01:05:21,TweetDeck,760,5825
Donald Trump did not create hate and racism bigotry and anti-Semitism. But what he has done is poured fuel on the fire that is raging more than I've seen in my lifetime. I will stand up against him and his hate. #GillibrandTownHall https://t.co/JoBscNgT5w,2019-03-19 01:03:02,TweetDeck,441,1937
I know the issue of Sen. Franken is hard for many Democrats. But he had eight credible sexual harassment allegations against him and I had to choose whether to stay silent or not. If some megadonors have a problem with that that's on them. https://t.co/POLWcTQUsY,2019-03-19 00:57:07,Twitter Media Studio,1950,11047
Clean air and clean water is a human right. I’ve made clean water one of my priorities including the PIPES Act. We should make polluters pay for the damage they inflict on communities and stop rolling back EPA regulations. #GillibrandTownHall,2019-03-19 00:55:03,TweetDeck,109,421
There is no such thing as an illegal human.  In our best moments we have not been afraid of immigrants; in our worst moments we have. We have to fundamentally transform how we treat people seeking asylum and refugees. #GillibrandTownHall,2019-03-19 00:45:27,TweetDeck,284,1451
Health care should be a right not a privilege. We need a president who'll fight for universal quality coverage that's affordable for everybody. I believe we need #MedicareForAll and that we should create a public option as a transition to single-payer. #GillibrandTownHall,2019-03-19 00:39:02,TweetDeck,121,495
Student debt is an out-of-control crisis in this country and it isn’t just a burden on individual graduates—it’s a drag on the whole economy. #GillibrandTownHall https://t.co/2om8Fl7se9,2019-03-19 00:34:26,TweetDeck,151,594
America is the only industrialized country in the world without a national paid leave plan. It's 2019. Let's make this a priority at last. #GillibrandTownHall https://t.co/t9HqRwOMy6,2019-03-19 00:28:48,TweetDeck,81,329
Rewarding work means a few things to me: We need to support unions and workers' rights. We need to raise the minimum wage to $15. We need to invest in job training. We need national paid leave.  And we need to punish companies who outsource American jobs. #GillibrandTownHall,2019-03-19 00:23:03,TweetDeck,141,694
America is facing an opioid crisis and one of the ways we need to put a stop to it is by holding opioid makers accountable for their greed. They knowingly put their profits over people's lives and they should be prosecuted. #GillibrandTownHall,2019-03-19 00:16:45,TweetDeck,63,314
We need to get money out of politics because the way Washington works is that the powerful have unlimited power and money is the name of the game. If we want change we need to stand up to the powerful special interests and restore the people's voices. #GillibrandTownHall,2019-03-19 00:12:17,TweetDeck,80,347
We all have a responsibility to end gun violence in this country. We all have to take on the corruption and greed that the NRA represents. It is unacceptable and I will hold them accountable. #GillibrandTownHall https://t.co/b5WDdYUqmL,2019-03-19 00:08:29,TweetDeck,74,256
I’m the best candidate to take on Trump because I have the vision of what needs to be done in America. I’ve listened to voters about their lives and I have the compassion to absorb that and offer a real plan. I have the experience and I’ve gotten things done. #GillibrandTownHall,2019-03-19 00:04:40,TweetDeck,77,480

We need to remember what it feels like to be brave. Brave doesn’t pit people against each other or put money over lives. It doesn’t spread hate cloud truth or build a wall. That’s what fear does.

The disparity in who gets arrested for marijuana possession is one sign of how unjustly our drug laws are enforced.

Completely agree. Nearly every American will take time off to care for themselves or for family but the majority of our workforce doesn’t have access to paid leave. It’s a policy that benefits all of us. Parents spouses seniors kids—everyone. We need to pass the #FamilyACT. https://t.co/zKcJ2W95qT,2019-02-08 21:35:48,Twitter Web Client,125,701
From day one @realDonaldTrump has staffed his administration based on one question: Who will help him skirt justice and accountability?  It's clear to me that Barr will hide the Mueller investigation from the public and bury the extent of Trump’s corruption.

We cannot for a minute lose sight of the fact that women’s right to control our own bodies is under attack.

Trump’s ban on transgender service members is discriminatory insults heroes serving in our military and makes us less safe. Opposition to it is bipartisan—backed by legislation to overturn it.

I said this last night to @jonlovett and here’s why: Institutions—colleges the military the NFL—don’t believe survivors and shame or retaliate against survivors to protect their own.

I support Dr. Tyson. She showed enormous courage in coming forward and her very credible claims require investigation. In this country institutional bias stacks against survivors for the powerful.

Women’s access to full reproductive care is a human right. To deny access to safe legal abortions is to deny a woman’s right to control her own life body and health.

They could have to wait for a year. This is not what America is supposed to be. https://t.co/m8822VdlgD,2019-01-25 18:37:57,Twitter for iPhone,232,584
Trump and McConnell’s shutdown is putting thousands of people’s safety and livelihoods at risk. This is not a political game gentlemen. Open the government. https://t.co/gxY9P0SfpH,2019-01-25 16:37:28,Twitter for iPhone,354,1676
I want to remind my Republican colleagues: We are elected to represent the American people not the president.  Our clean bill to fund the government—without funding a $5.7B ridiculous wall—fell just short today. Let's put working families first and open the government.,2019-01-25 01:39:37,Twitter Web Client,1818,8934
Trump’s EPA is led by a former coal lobbyist. Now fines on polluters are down to record lows. They’re selling off our water air and health—right out in the open.  This is what a corrupt government looks like. We're going to take power back for people.  https://t.co/o89Osokp8X,2019-01-25 00:11:53,Twitter for iPhone,521,1329
Climate change is an immediate and catastrophic threat to our future. And yes it's real.  We need to: ✅Get to net-zero carbon emissions ✅Invest in clean energy and green jobs ✅Update infrastructure and build community resiliency  We need a #GreenNewDeal and we need it now. https://t.co/viCTQMix9b,2019-01-24 21:41:43,TweetDeck,584,3065
This administration—stocked with out-of-touch powerful elites—fundamentally does not understand the struggles working families face. They can't be trusted to help the people of this country if they don’t get it and don’t care. Americans deserve better. https://t.co/Ok6SbCPATR,2019-01-24 19:14:38,TweetDeck,232,999
Any parent knows that you don't reward a tantrum. And you definitely don't reward one that lasts 33 days and holds an entire country hostage.  Stop this insanity. It’s time to open the government.,2019-01-24 17:14:51,Twitter for iPhone,3581,21594
We're doing it for them. https://t.co/0gcIe1xPoJ,2019-01-23 23:57:22,Twitter for iPhone,122,1731
You can't talk seriously about strengthening our economy if you aren't putting the needs of families front and center: universal pre-K affordable child care equal pay for equal work and national paid family and medical leave.,2019-01-23 19:15:01,TweetDeck,308,2053
This is no time to remain silent. It’s a time to raise our voices and fight for our beliefs and values with everything we have. I’ve never backed down from a fight and I know that you won’t either. Let’s do this: https://t.co/bEYdmyBc1q,2019-01-23 16:07:56,Twitter for iPhone,64,452
My values are not for sale – which is why we're building this campaign without any contributions from corporate PACs federal lobbyists or a Super PAC. But we do need you. Chip in and let's build this together: https://t.co/KD97rRwmkb,2019-01-23 02:19:50,Twitter for iPhone,114,988
Remember: Abortion existed before #RoevWade it just wasn't legal or safe. Women died without that access to the health care they needed. We're not going back to that.  This isn't just a fight for equality — it's a fight for our lives. And it's one I refuse to lose.,2019-01-23 01:03:16,Twitter for iPhone,1920,10069
Always fun to talk with @jonfavs and @crookedmedia about how we can work together to fix...just about everything. Check out our conversation out now! https://t.co/funoM6XFoO https://t.co/MKznrstJO0,2019-01-22 22:52:54,TweetDeck,58,689
Today marks 46 years to the day since Roe v. Wade established women’s constitutional right to make private decisions about our bodies and legalized abortion nationwide. 46 years—don’t you think it’s about time politicians stopped trying to control women’s bodies?,2019-01-22 21:09:32,TweetDeck,1450,7949
@RepAOC Happy to help - New Yorkers stick together! 🗽,2019-01-22 20:20:50,Twitter Web Client,5,99
Trump's hateful ban on transgender troops in our military is an affront to their service and has nothing to do with unit cohesion or readiness.  Take it from our military leaders themselves. I’ve asked them.  “Just not an issue.”  “No.”  “Precisely zero.” https://t.co/ai6xG708Re,2019-01-22 18:23:55,TweetDeck,1983,5831
The fight against institutional racism in America cannot be left only to people who experience it. White people like me need to join men and women of color on the battlefield for social justice. https://t.co/eaKijXe3X0,2019-01-22 03:22:58,Twitter Ads,678,3941
Universal pre-K has lifelong benefits for our kids—leveling the playing field of opportunity for all children no matter what block they grow up on. It's a top priority of mine as it should be for anyone who cares about education and economic equality. https://t.co/KkY7HEGRhq,2019-01-22 02:11:12,Twitter for iPhone,197,1054
In the nine years since the Citizens United ruling unaccountable money has eroded our democracy. As long as candidates continue to accept corporate PAC and federal lobbyist donations we can't fix what's broken.  One person one vote. It's time to overturn Citizens United.,2019-01-21 22:47:14,Twitter for iPhone,921,3951
A pretty amazing thought today: Four women are already running for president in 2020 which will mark exactly 100 years since women gained the right to vote. So proud of how far we’ve come and excited to see what we’ll do next.,2019-01-21 20:19:58,TweetDeck,3959,31379
I can't think a better place to talk about a vision for our country than with one of the greatest advocates and leaders for social justice in the country today. Thank you for your generosity and friendship @TheRevAl. https://t.co/ni4pOiDipR,2019-01-21 19:41:04,TweetDeck,41,248
Dr. King's life should push all of us to not shy away from the gravest injustices and the toughest fights. This is a moment for all of us to ask ourselves what we are called to do. "Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.",2019-01-21 18:57:55,TweetDeck,35,210
The fact that black men and women do not earn a dollar on the dollar in the workplace as a white man has to be my fight too. Because if I really care about every child as much as I do my own then these are my fights to help overcome too.,2019-01-21 18:56:05,TweetDeck,48,341
The fact that a black woman in New York City is 12 times more likely to die in childbirth is outrageous and it's all of our responsibility to fix that. The fact that a young black or brown man is 10 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession is all of our burden.,2019-01-21 18:54:13,TweetDeck,44,268
Fighting racism and injustice will take all of us — it cannot be left to people of color alone. White people like me need to take up our part of this burden and commit to using our voices to amplify those that have been ignored and silenced for too long.,2019-01-21 18:52:29,TweetDeck,42,172
Today so many decades after Dr. King's assassination we need more than ever to have an honest conversation about racism: not just individual acts but the systemic institutional racism infecting our society — our healthcare education criminal justice system and economy.,2019-01-21 18:50:34,TweetDeck,39,164
As we honor Dr. King today we should all think What am I doing with MY own time here on this earth to serve others? Because he taught us that serving others is the greatest purpose in life. And as he said “The time is always right to do what is right.”,2019-01-21 18:49:22,TweetDeck,39,167
Dr. King continues to inspire us because he believed in values that transcend time and movements: He believed in right vs. wrong; that only light can drive out darkness; that we're all called to fight for others because an injustice against one is an injustice against all.,2019-01-21 18:47:29,TweetDeck,161,921
Later today I’ll be speaking on Dr. King’s teachings at @NationalAction in Harlem — but first dinosaurs with Henry! (In his new favorite @RAYGUNshirts hoodie of course.) https://t.co/7wixIrF3tx,2019-01-21 16:49:58,Twitter for iPhone,32,414
As we celebrate Dr. King's life and vision today I believe his message is as alive now as it ever was. https://t.co/bzSzG7zyCg,2019-01-21 14:27:10,Twitter Web Client,134,713

I believe we’re called to fight for one another. And we stand on the shoulders of those who’ve come before us. We won’t back down from these fights because we must stand on the right side of history.,2019-01-20 15:57:01,Twitter Web Client,133,909
Two years since @realDonaldTrump took office and through it all we’ve linked arms to protect health care for 24 million people defend reproductive rights stand up for immigrants and federal workers and demand transparency and accountability.,2019-01-20 15:55:33,Twitter Web Client,361,2677
@sniffinee @SCActionNetwork Really appreciated your thoughtful question! We need affordable universal daycare so that all kids no matter where they grow up no matter their socioeconomic background can have access to the same opportunities. I'll keep fighting and speaking out until we get there.,2019-01-20 02:45:23,Twitter for iPhone,5,12
Today’s march may be over but our movement is only growing stronger. Keep working together to raise your voices and fight for our beliefs because the only time our democracy ever works is when we all stand up together and demand it. https://t.co/Mpx9h5I4Cz,2019-01-20 02:43:54,Twitter Web Client,160,1092
