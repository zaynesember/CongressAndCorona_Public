Those who suggest we must choose between our Constitutional rights and our children's safety are wrong. We can and MUST protect both. #EnoughIsEnough,2019-02-14 19:04:12,Twitter Web Client,42,157
Congress must hear the voices of gun violence survivors and:  1) Reinstate the assault weapons ban 2) Ban high capacity magazines 3) Close background check loopholes  We should enact these measures immediately. The bills are written and waiting. @SenateMajLdr should let us vote.,2019-02-14 19:04:12,Twitter Web Client,29,72
17 students and staff were gunned down in Parkland Florida one year ago today. Since then the survivors have turned their tragedy into action and activism. And it's been inspiring.  But we are the adults. We are the ones responsible for their safety. We must act too. #Enough https://t.co/Gd8nneAcoT,2019-02-14 19:04:11,Twitter Web Client,19,68
The #FAMILYAct would establish a national #PaidFamilyLeave guaranteeing 12 weeks of paid family leave and coverage for serious family caregiving events.  The American Dream only works if parents can. Congress must support them. Congress must pass the FAMILY Act.,2019-02-12 21:59:40,Twitter Web Client,19,79
Too many parents have to choose between taking care of their families and going to the jobs that allow them to provide a home.  I'm cosponsoring the #FAMILYAct because it's past time we change that. It's time we stop asking working mothers and fathers to make impossible choices.,2019-02-12 21:59:40,Twitter Web Client,25,121
Good. I stand with you.  Make no mistake: TPS recipients are legal immigrants. They came here seeking refuge from tragedy. Now they are the parents of more than 190000 U.S. born children and 1/3 of them are U.S. homeowners. They deserve a permanent solution. #TPSJustice #SaveTPS https://t.co/K8FQ2PXSni,2019-02-12 18:02:05,Twitter Web Client,45,131
Memorial Stadium couldn't contain Frank Robinson as a player. He's still the only person to the be MVP of both leagues. He also broke the color barrier as a manager – and as an MLB executive too.

Happening now: I'm on the Senate floor w/ @SenTinaSmith calling for back pay for federal contract workers. These civil servants work shoulder to shoulder with federal employees and were hit hard by the #shutdown. They deserve to be made whole.

.@POTUS whatever your foreign policy goals we must consult with our intelligence and military leaders as well as with our allies. The problem is that you often don't.  "America first" has become "America alone" and that does not make us stronger -- or safer. #SOTU,2019-02-06 03:18:48,Twitter Web Client,63,221

I join @POTUS in celebrating the record-setting number of women serving in Congress.  But gender equality deserves more than lip service. It deserves to be expressly protected by our Constitution. If we're serious about women's rights we must support ratifying the #ERANow. #SOTU,2019-02-06 02:57:01,Twitter Web Client,64,276

#BlackHistoryMonth makes me especially proud to have so many museums that celebrate and narrate the stories of Black Americans right here in Maryland – and in our backyard.

Let's continue to speak their names as promises to build a brighter and more equal future.,2019-02-02 15:30:01,TweetDeck,20,74
This is devastating. In this country no one should be just one paycheck away from not being able to afford food or housing.

Big thanks to @Alyssa_Milano for coming by to talk about how we can get the Equal Rights Amendment over the finish line. Equal protection under our Constitution isn’t a partisan issue — it’s a basic human rights one. Glad to have your support on this. Let’s get it done. #ERANow https://t.co/9Br92mFOU6,2019-01-29 21:04:56,Twitter for iPhone,62,294
Couldn't agree more. Gender equality should be explicitly protected by our Constitution and I'm proud to be working with you @RepMaloney and @LisaMurkowski to get that done. Let's get the ERA across the finish line. #ERANow https://t.co/Amu1NUBtCJ,2019-01-29 15:21:13,Twitter Web Client,65,228

.@LisaMurkowski and I agree: women should not be provided fewer protections under the law because of their gender. This is a human rights issue not a partisan one.

With @POTUS’ senseless #shutdown finally over let us take away this lesson: federal workers are dedicated hardworking civil servants. They run our airports our food safety our natl security our economy. They deserve our thanks and Americans deserve the services they provide.,2019-01-26 22:27:58,Twitter for iPhone,236,920
I thank all of those who worked w/o pay for their dedication and those who were needlessly locked out of their jobs on furlough. The American people now have a better understanding of the critical role you play in our communities and across the country.,2019-01-25 20:54:01,Twitter Web Client,26,136

We all want secure borders. We want protections for #Dreamers and TPS recipients. I stand firmly for both. But reopening govt must be our first priority.

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. is famous for having a dream. But what made him a force of history what made him remarkable was his unstoppable drive to bring that dream to life.

Dr. King taught us that civil rights is not a fixed destination but an evolving journey whose path we must walk together.  This #MartinLutherKingJrDay let's keep walking.

In a speech called “a plan to reopen the government” we unfortunately heard very little about the urgency of reopening the government.  We must do that first.
