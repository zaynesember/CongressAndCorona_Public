BIG NEWS: The #FY20NDAA establishes the U.S. Space Force – the first new branch of the U.S. Armed Forces since 1947 and a top priority of @realDonaldTrump. Space is a warfighting domain and we must be prepared to meet emerging threats in this new battlefield. https://t.co/iQyCzrAXfd,2019-12-10 16:57:27,TweetDeck,13,41
Proud to join @SenJackReed @RepAdamSmith @MacTxPress in unveiling the #FY20NDAA. This bill puts our troops and America’s security first – and I look forward to its swift passage.

Joined @SenRonJohnson @SenatorDurbin &amp;60 of our colleagues in intro'ing a resolution in response to Russian aggression.
