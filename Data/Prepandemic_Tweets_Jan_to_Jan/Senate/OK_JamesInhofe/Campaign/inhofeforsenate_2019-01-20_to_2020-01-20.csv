I have always advocated for stronger economic ties with Israel. One of our most recent partnerships will generate at least $20 billion in economic activity &amp; help secure peace through energy security. I applaud all involved! https://t.co/gAN4eULu1Z,2020-01-19 18:00:04,joe.sentry,0,2
@realDonaldTrump &amp; I have accomplished a lot together over the last 4 years.
