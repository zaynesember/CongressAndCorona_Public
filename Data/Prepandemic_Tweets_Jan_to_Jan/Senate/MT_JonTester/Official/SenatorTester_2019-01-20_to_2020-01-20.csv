These hospitals face a shortage of doctors forcing many Montanans to drive long distances to find treatment. So I introduced my Restoring Rural Residencies Act to help these hospitals recruit residents and encourage them to establish practices in rural communities. 2/3,2019-08-27 20:53:08,Twitter for iPhone,1,29
It was an honor to be recognized by the Billings Clinic today for my work to help recruit more doctors for Montana’s Critical Access Hospitals.

Shining a light on Big Pharma's backroom dealings is an important first step towards accountability. Prescription drug costs are too high. Families deserve transparency &amp; change. That's why I've introduced legislation to enact that change. #mtpol https://t.co/lFIIlmlpKO,2019-02-27 18:45:31,Twitter Web Client,12,82

Folks shouldn't have to go into debt to get the medications they need. That's why I helped reintroduce the SPIKE Act to shine more light on the pharmaceutical industry’s backroom dealings and hold them accountable for massive price hikes. #mtpol @ABCFOXMT https://t.co/cawmevsf2G,2019-02-26 01:57:55,Twitter Web Client,59,261

Microbreweries &amp; microdistilleries have been an incredible success story in Montana. That's why I helped reintroduce a bill to help them keep growing succeeding and having fun.

More than 20k Montanans/yr receive care thanks to Title X funding. By restricting access a small group of politicians &amp; bureaucrats are dictating medical treatment options hamstringing providers &amp; jeopardizing access to affordable health care. #mtpol https://t.co/gHRYp7ti03,2019-02-23 01:53:01,Twitter Web Client,44,146
