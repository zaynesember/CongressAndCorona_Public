In hampering American agriculture the #GreenNewDeal does not match up with these moral responsibilities.,2019-03-26 14:46:44,TweetDeck,3,6
I realize there are those who think the GND is a moral imperative.  But farmers continuing to feed the world is also a moral imperative.  Too many go hungry each day in America ending this is also a moral imperative.,2019-03-26 14:46:22,TweetDeck,4,15
These policy discussions must recognize the complexity of the agriculture and food value chain—growers input suppliers processors handlers and consumers.  And they must be based in reality to facilitate a genuine conversation between rural and urban constituencies.,2019-03-26 14:45:33,TweetDeck,3,3
Consumers will assuredly continue to demand the choice of animal protein here in the U.S. and so any reasonable discussion on the agriculture sector’s contributions to solutions on climate change must begin with this acknowledgment.,2019-03-26 14:45:16,TweetDeck,5,8
Regulating American farmers and ranchers out of business will only result in food and fiber production being outsourced to countries that do not have the same conservation-minded producers that we have here in the U.S.,2019-03-26 14:44:42,TweetDeck,15,27
Over the last 50 years American farmers have reduced water use in pork production by 41%.,2019-03-26 14:43:02,TweetDeck,5,17
American farmers and ranchers raise the same amount of beef today as they did in the 1970s but they do so with 33% fewer cattle.,2019-03-26 14:42:51,TweetDeck,8,14
Obviously we cannot and do not produce food in the same manner our grandparents did because those methods were not sustainable and today would not produce food at the scope and scale our troubled and hungry world demands.,2019-03-26 14:42:29,TweetDeck,3,11
American farmers ranchers and others in rural America are constantly working to produce their crops and to raise their livestock in order to feed a growing world and do so with constant challenges presented to them from Mother Nature.,2019-03-26 14:41:14,TweetDeck,19,56

I do not question the intent of the authors of the #GreenNewDeal but they don’t know what they don’t know. They need to catch up with the Agriculture committee and with farm country.,2019-03-26 14:39:36,TweetDeck,9,23
