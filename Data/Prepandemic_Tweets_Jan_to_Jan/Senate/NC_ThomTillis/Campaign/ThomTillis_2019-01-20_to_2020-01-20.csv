As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act we have record low unemployment for women and minorities booming retirement accounts and 401ks and consistent wage growth that we have not seen since the Great Recession. Do they really want to reverse our progress?,2019-12-17 15:24:24,Twitter Web App,2,4

The Democrats who hit the debate stage yesterday have made their radical socialist positions clear before and they doubled down on them again last night. Will you join me and President @realDonaldTrump in fighting back? https://t.co/lkjq90JGXR,2019-11-21 15:23:18,TweetDeck,1,8
Democrats' push for socialism was again on display during tonight's debate.   @realDonaldTrump and I are fighting back. We're delivering on our promises to implement conservative policies that are creating jobs &amp; have the economy booming.   Stand with us so that we can keep it up https://t.co/KMm0DlDF0O,2019-11-21 04:34:13,Twitter Web App,5,55
While the Democrats are arguing about their job-killing Green New Deal President @realDonaldTrump and I implemented pro-growth policies that have created 7 million jobs &amp; given us record-low unemployment for women minorities and all Americans.,2019-11-21 03:16:27,TweetDeck,23,96
My opponents think the ideas in the Democratic Presidential Debate are “refreshing." We’ve heard about eliminating employer-based health insurance raising taxes on the middle class &amp; impeaching @realDonaldTrump. There’s nothing refreshing about this radical liberal agenda.,2019-11-21 03:07:06,TweetDeck,7,30
When the Democrats hit the debate stage tonight they’ll continue to double down on promises they can’t keep as well as socialist and open border plans that are dangerous for North Carolinians. I stand with @realDonaldTrump &amp; the work we're doing together to help all Americans. https://t.co/wLpGoFMYid,2019-11-20 21:30:41,TweetDeck,9,55
It's simple: Americans want results which President @realDonaldTrump delivers on daily.

Today I joined @PatMcCroryNC to talk about how the Democrats' impeachment effort has been flawed since the start and is just the latest of their many attempts to destroy @realDonaldTrump in order to stop us from advancing our shared conservative agenda. https://t.co/ztn1FtpcH3,2019-11-19 16:24:39,TweetDeck,4,15
Adam Schiff and Nancy Pelosi are once again trying to impeach @realDonaldTrump to advance their own political agendas.

For too long many veterans have been unable to see a doctor &amp; receive care because of bureaucratic nightmares.

North Carolinians are tired of the Democrats and their endless efforts to reverse the results of the 2016 election with impeachment.
