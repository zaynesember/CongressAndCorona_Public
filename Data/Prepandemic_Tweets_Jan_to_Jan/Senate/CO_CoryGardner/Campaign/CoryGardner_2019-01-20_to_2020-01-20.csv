Expanding government &amp; spending more of your tax dollars was a theme tonight but do any of the #DemDebate candidates have proposals to decentralize the Washington bureaucracy &amp; give more power to the people?

Bipartisan immigration reform is needed &amp; that's why I have worked with both Ds and Rs to address this problem including funding for border security.

Candidates at tonight's #DemDebate want to eliminate the tax cuts that have led to increased wage growth investment in distressed communities record low unemployment and so much more.
