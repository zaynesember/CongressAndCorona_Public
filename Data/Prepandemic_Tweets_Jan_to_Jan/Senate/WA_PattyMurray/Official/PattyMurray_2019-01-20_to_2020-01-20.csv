It’s time for Republicans to stop: ❌sabotaging families’ care ❌making health coverage more expensive &amp; further out of reach ❌trying to undermine Medicaid &amp; the millions of people who rely on it  They need to start working with Dems to take real action for patients &amp; families.,2019-06-12 21:06:26,Twitter Web Client,24,81
WA state is innovating &amp; showing Medicaid can help address employment challenges housing needs &amp; other social determinants of health to improve the health of entire communities.   We’re proving Medicaid can do more—while Republicans in D.C. are trying to gut it so it does less.,2019-06-12 21:05:22,Twitter Web Client,21,74
Speaking on the Senate floor to focus on President Trump and Republicans' tireless effort to undermine Medicaid—a program that helps millions of people across the country get quality affordable health care.  https://t.co/7WK3fF28hT,2019-06-12 21:02:04,Twitter Media Studio,38,121
🎤 Hi @SenTedCruz. @AyannaPressley is exactly right. We'd all love to have your support for accessible *AND* affordable OTC birth control. Will get you the details. https://t.co/J0zEGUWOwD,2019-06-12 20:56:17,Twitter Web Client,63,544
Thank you @SenKamalaHarris for supporting #ChildCare4All! We need to do better for working families and that includes ensuring no parent has to pay more than they can afford for high-quality child care. https://t.co/mFPOVWvnAy,2019-06-12 20:33:00,TweetDeck,34,157
People across the country made clear they want Congress to make sure they can get quality affordable health care. Democrats are fighting for impactful ideas like Medicare negotiation to bring down drug prices and proposals to roll back President Trump’s health care sabotage. https://t.co/fiwsernm87,2019-06-12 20:03:00,Twitter Media Studio,43,141
From banning trans servicemembers from the military to allowing discrimination at work or at home this admin. has been working overtime to take away the rights of LGBTQIA+ Americans. This #PrideMonth and every month we stand together &amp; fight back against these cruel attacks.,2019-06-12 18:36:00,TweetDeck,21,73
The Trump Admininstration is misleading Congress so it can use the 2020 Census as a political weapon to advance partisan gerrymandering. This is absolutely unacceptable. I will keep pushing DOJ and the Dept. of Commerce to follow the law and reverse this terrible proposal.,2019-06-12 17:15:00,TweetDeck,111,375
Medicare is one of the largest purchasers of prescription drugs in the country. Letting it use its sway to negotiate lower prices is an important step we can take to bring down high prescription drug costs. If Republicans are serious about tackling this issue they'll join us.,2019-06-12 15:30:24,Twitter Web Client,32,102
At the end of the day President Trump's talk is cheap &amp; prescription drugs are still far too expensive. It's clear Congress needs to take the lead to bring down high drug costs—&amp; Dems are pushing to do that by allowing Medicare to negotiate lower prices. https://t.co/7LVhodBnEw,2019-06-12 15:27:31,Twitter Media Studio,37,118
It has been three years since the tragic mass shooting at Pulse nightclub targeting the LGBTQIA+ community. Gun violence in our country has not stopped.   We can truly honor those lost at Pulse &amp; their families by passing gun reform that puts an end to these senseless tragedies. https://t.co/OwZ0RDOv3U,2019-06-12 13:29:42,Twitter Web Client,40,137
Nearly 3 million students struggle to keep up in school because they don't have home internet. We need to close the "homework gap" to make sure all students have the opportunity to succeed—and the Digital Equity Act would put us on a path to do that. https://t.co/XjW2osCMhr,2019-06-12 00:15:00,TweetDeck,27,73
Last year I worked to increase funding for child care grants because too many families are struggling to make ends meet. Because of that increase WA state will be able to give providers larger subsidies that help cover the costs of high-quality care. https://t.co/CkGtzFXi0i,2019-06-11 23:35:00,TweetDeck,17,51
Too many people work more than 40 hours a week and still struggle to support their families. I’m proud to introduce the Restoring Overtime Act to update our overtime rules and give families the financial security they need. https://t.co/2XjsXTMeN6,2019-06-11 21:58:00,TweetDeck,9,44
.@USWNT is one of the best soccer teams in the world but despite their successes they make substantially less than the men’s team.  I'm proud of the players for demanding #EqualPay &amp; I'm supporting them on and off the field. https://t.co/n1jygXNz7k,2019-06-11 21:05:00,TweetDeck,26,134
The gender pay gap hurts women their families and our economy in every community in every state.   I'm calling on Republican leaders to end this obstruction and bring the #PaycheckFairnessAct to the Senate floor. https://t.co/bLVrVP1Cid,2019-06-11 20:48:09,Twitter Web Client,69,237
So many families struggle to find affordable #summercare—putting financial strain on parents &amp; hurting students' learning potential. My bill would make sure we do more to support working families especially in the summer. #ChildCare4All https://t.co/9pl57bAQyZ,2019-06-11 16:25:00,TweetDeck,23,42
Today marks 1 year since the @FCC’s repeal of #NetNeutrality went into effect &amp; changed the internet as we know it.  The #SaveTheNet Act could fix it but Republican leaders are ignoring millions of Americans and letting the bill die in the legislative graveyard.,2019-06-11 15:43:00,TweetDeck,144,304
Because moms and dads shared their stories and used their voices last year we were able to secure a historic increase in federal funding for child care and development. Thanks to @amprog you can see how each state plans to use the additional funds: https://t.co/CkGtzFFH8K,2019-06-11 13:53:05,Twitter Web Client,12,55
WATCH: Leader McConnell admits that the goal of extreme state #abortionbans is to roll back #RoeVWade.   This is about women's ability to control their futures decide when and whether to have a family and be financially secure. We've got to keep speaking out. https://t.co/DfMHilvZJC,2019-06-10 22:04:00,TweetDeck,686,1083
Not all reasons for getting an abortion are the same. But what should be the same is that every woman has the ability to control her body and her future by making that decision herself. https://t.co/EBbdbkZSzE,2019-06-10 21:18:09,Twitter Web Client,67,278
It has been over 50 years since Congress passed the #EqualPay Act—and yet women especially women of color still aren't paid what they deserve.   This shouldn't be a partisan issue. Congress needs to pass the #PaycheckFairnessAct to ensure equal pay for equal work.,2019-06-10 13:13:00,TweetDeck,42,159
Backing out of the Paris Climate Agreement was a self-inflicted injury to America’s credibility in the global fight to combat climate change. I joined 40+ @SenateDems to correct that mistake and work toward a solution.,2019-06-09 23:22:50,Twitter Web Client,173,630
The Trump Admin and Republican leaders are pushing a partisan lawsuit that would take away protections for people with pre-ex conditions let insurers kick people off their parent’s plans and avoid covering birth control.  This is NOT what families sent us here to do. https://t.co/TKVwvNlGht,2019-06-09 19:30:00,Twitter Media Studio,710,1391
