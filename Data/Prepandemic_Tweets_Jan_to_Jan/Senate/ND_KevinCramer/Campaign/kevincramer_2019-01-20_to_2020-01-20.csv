One year ago the people of ND honored me by electing me to become our state’s 24th US Senator. It has been a journey and the honor of a lifetime. I covet the prayers and counsel of the incredible people I get to represent and am grateful for their trust and God’s amazing grace. https://t.co/CY5qWDC3Bz,2019-11-06 20:18:39,Twitter for iPhone,7,26
Gene Hanson is letting all who fly over North Dakota know our farmers support @realDonaldTrump for @POTUS in 2020 #KeepAmericaGreat #TrumpPence2020 https://t.co/avFUB3ThuS,2019-11-05 15:51:18,Twitter for iPhone,23,75
Burgum-Sanford is a great team for a great state. Kris &amp; I are honored to serve along side such remarkable leaders &amp; commit ourselves to doing all we can for their re-election.  North Dakota is blessed by their service &amp; deserves 4 more years. https://t.co/8jCV13v9FR via @YouTube,2019-10-24 14:10:50,Twitter for iPhone,5,16
It’s interesting that after @POTUS @realDonaldTrump paid tribute to law enforcement in the Minneapolis rally liberals riot outside throwing things at the police. I can’t wait to hear the outrage from the media.,2019-10-11 02:43:53,Twitter for iPhone,65,200
That was a great shoutout for you @LewisForMN ! You deserve it! https://t.co/U3JJ5K8ArE,2019-10-11 01:49:40,Twitter for iPhone,16,49
Oh oh. The swamp gets busted again. https://t.co/l82s0GENAh,2019-10-11 01:18:14,Twitter for iPhone,8,17
You nailed it Jason. @TheDemocrats would rather America fail than @POTUS @realDonaldTrump succeed. #SoSad https://t.co/SLnkiEsAyt,2019-10-06 00:48:38,Twitter for iPhone,3,9
@kayleighmcenany @TeamTrump Honored to be on board and ready to serve.,2019-10-04 22:54:00,Twitter for iPhone,4,10
Do I ever. You do a great job in the booth and I love watching on @foxsports. Long before politics I umpires a lot of Legion Baseball. The thick skin comes in handy. Keep up the good work. https://t.co/71ZOs7EGbg,2019-09-20 14:27:08,Twitter for iPhone,0,8
@LaTroyHawkins32 should stop making excuses for Montgomery. He complained to the umpire for five innings while grooving HR pitches to the best bombers in MLB. #GoTwins,2019-09-20 01:50:27,Twitter for iPad,0,1
Congrats on making the run Jason! You are exactly the Republican who can win in Minnesota in 2020. A maxed out contribution from my Badlands PAC is on the way! https://t.co/yGDXfHjCm5,2019-08-22 20:12:16,Twitter for iPhone,3,7
These Democrat candidates are running as far left as possible &amp; out of the mainstream of middle America.   Their race to be named Most Radical stands in stark contrast with @realDonaldTrump’s record of results. #DemDebate #MAGA @EveningEdit https://t.co/OdOhne7KrG,2019-07-31 00:03:05,TweetDeck,3,15
Having served with @Jason2CD in the @NDHouseGOP I certainly hope he runs for the Senate. Jason is a solid conservative fighter and good friend. https://t.co/3XDhXmqmK3,2019-07-18 01:36:15,Twitter for iPhone,4,12
I went to a pro-Israel meeting and a @realDonaldTrump rally broke out. https://t.co/8UJ4uGcWhc,2019-04-06 19:00:10,Twitter for iPhone,8,29
These angels were in DC to celebrate their Papa’s swearing in. If they promote hotels as well as they promoted me you’ll need to add a phone line. https://t.co/VaJurTIeIF,2019-03-25 22:25:49,Twitter for iPhone,3,25
We had great fellowship with Ken Hall of MHA Nation &amp; Lt. Gen. Mick Kicklighter at a luncheon as part of the Governor’s Prayer Breakfast. #GodIsGood https://t.co/MlK4BG0UIx,2019-03-08 23:26:33,Twitter for iPhone,6,16
As @realDonaldTrump said we must never let our country become a socialist nation.   This has to stop. We can't let Democrats successfully pull North Dakota toward this harmful liberal agenda. https://t.co/UCJjSGoP74,2019-02-18 16:49:51,Twitter for iPhone,31,92
