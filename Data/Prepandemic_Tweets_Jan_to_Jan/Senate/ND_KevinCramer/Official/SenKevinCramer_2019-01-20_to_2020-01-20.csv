@POTUS I want to emphasize an overlooked point: Soleimani was killed in Iraq not Iran.

.@POTUS is ready to address the crisis at the southern border.   It’s on Congress to decide whether to continue obstructing his efforts or to be part of the solution. #SOTU https://t.co/8kmDGo8kLN,2019-02-04 19:07:22,TweetDeck,13,35
I joined @SenJoniErnst in re-introducing Sarah’s Law.   No one should walk free after taking someone’s life. We have to work to protect our citizens. https://t.co/v1nfkfrXU5,2019-02-04 14:27:48,TweetDeck,4,18
@NCC worship was incredible today at Barracks Row. Message by @joelschmidgall &amp; @ninaschmidgall touched Kris and me. I can’t wait to read their new book. #prayingcirclesaroundyourmarriage #GodisGood.,2019-02-03 18:56:59,Twitter for iPhone,4,9

From day one @POTUS has made it clear he will not allow the U.S. to be the victim of foreign nations acting in bad faith.   I support this administration and our NATO allies as they engage in effective arms control negotiations that will hold all parties accountable.,2019-02-01 20:08:36,Twitter for iPhone,3,16
Let’s be clear: Russia has been violating this treaty for years.  Their covert attempts to continue developing a missile system the INF explicitly prohibited is unacceptable. https://t.co/g4V4sm8TqF,2019-02-01 20:08:36,Twitter for iPhone,4,16
A smart step by @SecretarySonny that will help diversify our agricultural exports.   This administration is doing an excellent job finding innovative ways to expand our markets even in the face of trade disputes. https://t.co/k9GGEdMQBg,2019-02-01 19:20:00,TweetDeck,3,6
Great to see Bruce Gjovig in D.C.   We spoke about the Cavalier Air Force Station the growth of Grand Sky in Grand Forks and my work on @SASCMajority this Congress. https://t.co/ytQSQpqSYM,2019-02-01 16:34:00,TweetDeck,4,16
Through this Conference Committee @POTUS has given Democrats a chance to live up to their rhetoric: that they would negotiate a deal while the government’s re-opened.   Let’s get this done. https://t.co/r4ZGSSc4Vt,2019-02-01 14:11:00,TweetDeck,11,38
Met with students from Minnewaukan High School in my office yesterday.   These students had great questions about the legislative process and immigration reform. https://t.co/07FOYmFbE8,2019-01-31 23:15:00,TweetDeck,4,21
A divided Congress presents an opportunity to strike a deal on an infrastructure package.   With the highway bill expiring soon now is the time to act. https://t.co/15feFm8X75,2019-01-31 20:50:29,TweetDeck,7,29
.@usdafsa changed the dates for deadlines that were impacted by the shutdown.   Get the facts here⬇️ https://t.co/c3hJJZ16u1,2019-01-31 15:17:19,TweetDeck,3,4
Good for @SecretarySonny.   The way the Senate’s handled nominations doesn’t work and it’s time we consider serious changes to the nominations process. https://t.co/Pqa08SqnaM,2019-01-30 21:02:02,TweetDeck,4,12
Great news: Grand Forks is ranked one of the best cities for veterans to live.   As a new member of the Senate Veterans Affairs committee I’ll work to give these veterans a voice on issues that matter most to them. https://t.co/ujhuOFqwQ4,2019-01-30 19:29:00,TweetDeck,5,13
North Dakota farmers and families should not have to posthumously pay for being successful.   The tax cuts were a good first step toward ending this unfair taxation and I hope we finally abolish it. https://t.co/DoEcyWvUCt,2019-01-30 17:28:00,TweetDeck,8,24
The tax cuts are working in North Dakota.   Since they were passed we’ve added over 9000 jobs. https://t.co/Uokp6eZNgw,2019-01-30 15:51:39,TweetDeck,105,355
I’m joining @SenJohnBarrasso @SenatorEnzi and @SenJohnHoeven to co-sponsor the ONSHORE Act.   As a former energy and environmental state regulator I’ve always opposed the federal government imposing its mediocrity on North Dakota. https://t.co/jzmR3VJt93,2019-01-30 15:11:00,TweetDeck,7,8
Looking forward to chairing this @EPWGOP subcommittee.   It gives North Dakota an outsized voice on issues like WOTUS the Clean Water Act and countless others. https://t.co/YHguUOghYn,2019-01-30 13:57:36,Twitter for iPhone,2,10

I’m co-sponsoring the End Government Shutdowns Act. It enhances predictability reduces pressure for imperfect last-minute deals saves taxpayer dollars and helps economic growth.   As a member of @BudgetGOP it’s time we make real changes to this process. https://t.co/PKNd58cgvR,2019-01-29 20:45:00,TweetDeck,4,15
Last night the Senate sent a positive message to our allies in the Middle East but the work isn’t done.   Let’s get this bill passed. https://t.co/GkNBFtwxgi,2019-01-29 19:50:00,TweetDeck,3,10
Another step in the right direction for our soybean producers thanks to @POTUS.   I’ll continue to work with the administration to see more markets opened and more export growth. https://t.co/3NSX8fsihh,2019-01-29 18:17:43,TweetDeck,6,22
Deeply disturbing.   As I’ve said from day one the rising tide of anti-Semitism among House Democrats shouldn’t be ignored or tolerated. https://t.co/O5BcoqSnPL,2019-01-29 17:38:14,Twitter for iPhone,778,1468
More than 4 in 5 American Indian women- and Alaska Native women- have experienced violence in their life.   That’s unacceptable.   I’m co-sponsoring #SavannasAct with @lisamurkowski because something must be done. https://t.co/DmDNjNsCfx,2019-01-29 17:10:01,TweetDeck,7,12
Our budget system needs reform. I’m co-sponsoring legislation with @senrobportman to prevent government shutdowns from creating chaos for the people who rely on federal services.   We have to end the weaponization of this process. https://t.co/HtREPzM0nv,2019-01-29 14:45:00,TweetDeck,9,29
With the government re-opened we’re again voting on a bill to support Israel and Jordan while sanctioning Assad.   Democrats first opposed it because of politics but now is their chance to stand with our allies in the region. https://t.co/eIixlG7aMI,2019-01-28 22:10:00,TweetDeck,7,13
We have 18 days to prevent another shutdown and fund border security.   I’m confident @SenJohnHoeven and our colleagues on the conference committee can find a long-term solution that satisfies both sides. https://t.co/FbtumjozCQ,2019-01-28 20:00:01,TweetDeck,5,26
We’ve reintroduced #SavannasAct important legislation to help combat crimes on tribal lands.   Let’s work together to make sure the #116thCongress gets this done. https://t.co/4ekPKwxb2S,2019-01-28 17:49:52,TweetDeck,14,36

With the government re-opened @SpeakerPelosi and Senate Democrats must come to the table so we can find a long-term solution. Now is the time to act. https://t.co/zRA0DPswk7,2019-01-26 22:05:00,TweetDeck,18,54
.@POTUS is right: Congress needs to step up and tackle immigration reform but this shutdown has demonstrated larger problems in the way our government is run.   Congress should consider including broad budgetary and personnel reforms in any future deals. https://t.co/EepORsuxBS,2019-01-25 21:46:32,Twitter for iPhone,9,23
I supported today’s deal.   While @SpeakerPelosi refused to even come to the table @POTUS was the adult in the room who ended this impasse.,2019-01-25 21:45:15,Twitter for iPhone,24,72
It’s a tragedy that what used to be the mainstream media rushes to judgement because they want to believe a story.   These students did nothing wrong.   They were not the guilty party. https://t.co/cM5SyYvVxs,2019-01-25 15:28:00,TweetDeck,24,90
Right now we’re voting on the one bill that actually ends this shutdown.   It secures the border re-opens the government gets federal workers paid and back to work and includes reforms Democrats have wanted for years.   Now is the time to get this done. https://t.co/rjL6jNAt9Z,2019-01-24 20:08:17,TweetDeck,20,59
Now is the time to get something done.   @SpeakerPelosi- and the Senate Democrats protecting her- are the reason the government is still shutdown but she is running out of time and her caucus is running out of patience. https://t.co/DPSsmeOPUZ,2019-01-24 19:15:00,TweetDeck,67,123
Spoke with @SandraSmithFox and @BillHemmer on @AmericaNewsroom about re-opening the government.   Only one of today's bills could become law and end the shutdown and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it. https://t.co/1giJToxVqa,2019-01-24 17:25:09,TweetDeck,9,23

If @SpeakerPelosi had spent as much time negotiating as she did being petty about the State of the Union the shutdown would be over by now. https://t.co/Kk2V7YQkdn,2019-01-23 22:06:26,TweetDeck,23,68
While @POTUS offers a plan to re-open the government and secure our borders Democrats only offer obstruction.   It’s now clear their only goal is to oppose this President. https://t.co/Tg5zq0LVbO,2019-01-23 19:15:00,TweetDeck,14,26

.@AmericaNewsroom with @BillHemmer &amp; @SandraSmithFox is revealing how sick the left is.   @washingtonpost reporter &amp; a leftist are incapable of blaming haters for Covington incident.

As @senatemajldr said “Everyone has made their point now it’s time to make a law.”   Even the Washington Post knows the Democrats need to stop yelling no and start working to end this shutdown. https://t.co/FCNob8wxpk,2019-01-22 21:54:00,TweetDeck,14,28
.@SpeakerPelosi and @POTUS have to come to some resolution.   While the President offers solutions the Speaker has offered nothing. It’s time for Democrats to get serious about ending the shutdown. https://t.co/Cgrg8N9TXn,2019-01-22 19:30:00,TweetDeck,17,54
