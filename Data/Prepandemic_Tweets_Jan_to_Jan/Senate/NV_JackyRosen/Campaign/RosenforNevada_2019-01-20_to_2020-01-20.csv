Harriet Trudell was instrumental in building Nevada’s progressive movement from her time with @SenatorReid to over 15 years serving as @NVDems political director.   Her death earlier this week was a loss for our state &amp; I’m thinking of her family &amp; friends during this time.,2019-12-22 16:33:08,Twitter for iPhone,3,31

Nevada is leading the way and setting a national example when it comes to getting women involved and elected.   I enjoyed meeting with women leaders in Reno this weekend to discuss how we can move our state forward together. https://t.co/ssNrvR8XJy,2019-12-09 04:05:22,Twitter for iPhone,31,141
Had a fantastic time joining so many friends and colleagues at the Elect Democratic Women conference.  Women are 50% of the population.  It’s about time we represent at least 50% of Congress. https://t.co/XCqTPJk3oC,2019-11-22 19:32:36,Twitter for iPhone,4,31
.@Astrid_NV is rightly one of the most sought-after Nevada endorsements for our Democratic presidential candidates.   Astrid is one of our country’s fiercest advocates for Dreamers and we’re lucky to have her in Nevada.  https://t.co/m4D78HpAUA,2019-11-19 23:43:32,Twitter for iPhone,13,98

I found my way into politics after I had raised my family and had a career as a computer programmer.  Our paths are unexpected and it’s a reminder that anyone from any background can – and should – run for office. #NationalRunForOfficeDay,2019-11-13 00:25:14,Twitter for iPhone,19,142

We wouldn't have made it to the moon without the work of numerous women computer scientists programmers and mathematicians.  Many of these women have gone unrecognized for decades. On #Apollo50 we thank them for their contributions to this achievement. https://t.co/AIKRuovHgf,2019-07-20 19:49:59,Twitter for iPhone,19,75

Victim-shaming is wrong and sets a dangerous precedent preventing survivors from coming forward with their stories. It has no place in society - and it especially has no place in politics. I strongly denounce these outrageous attacks. https://t.co/qlYBKE3s3L,2019-03-14 16:56:50,Twitter for iPhone,59,188
Congratulations to @WillMcCurdyII on his election to a second term as Chair of @nvdems. I'm more than confident in your leadership &amp; I look forward to what you'll be able to help Nevada accomplish in 2020. #Onward #NVDems https://t.co/Higz1MX5tx,2019-03-05 23:01:47,Twitter for iPhone,12,64
