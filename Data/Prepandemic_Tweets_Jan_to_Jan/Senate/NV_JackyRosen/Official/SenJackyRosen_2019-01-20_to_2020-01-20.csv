I placed holds last month on 2 DHS nominees until conditions for migrant children at the border improve.  After my visit it's clear they haven't. This morning I sent a letter to @DHSMcAleenan outlining 3 needed reforms. Until these reforms are implemented my holds will remain. https://t.co/fJP75U5XIS,2019-07-23 17:14:35,Twitter Web App,41,84
We owe it to migrant children and families to reach an immediate solution. We owe it to our law enforcement to prevent this difficult situation from continuing.   We must come together and we must take action. Now.,2019-07-23 15:43:32,Twitter Web App,4,19

The evidence is clear: conditions at these facilities have not improved and until they do I will not remove my holds on this Administration’s nominees.,2019-07-23 15:42:51,Twitter Web App,3,14
I refuse to stand by while this takes place on American soil. So I took action by placing holds on two individuals nominated to serve in administrative and policy roles at DHS until conditions in these facilities drastically improve.,2019-07-23 15:41:06,Twitter Web App,5,16
We saw children stuffed into crowded spaces. The people detained in these facilities lack access to basic necessities like toothpaste and access to sanitary supplies. There are few if any pediatricians. No child welfare professionals. No hope.,2019-07-23 15:39:46,Twitter Web App,2,11
Families are still being separated. Traumatized children are still in cages and this Administration continues to ignore basic human rights. Children should never be held in these conditions under any circumstance for any amount of time. Period.,2019-07-23 15:39:05,Twitter Web App,2,13
Children and their families are coming to our country for the same reason so many of our ancestors did – because they have no other choice. We are a nation of immigrants built on a foundation of core values and we do not turn away those fleeing persecution.,2019-07-23 15:35:09,Twitter Web App,5,19
