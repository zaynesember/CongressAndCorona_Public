If Democrats want to constrain the president’s ability to kill terrorist masterminds like Soleimani they should have the courage of their convictions &amp; block spending for the brave troops who carried out the strike instead of introducing unconstitutional war powers resolutions. https://t.co/93jq9a1BoK,2020-01-16 02:18:48,Twitter Web App,149,515
This war powers resolution is meant to tie the president’s hands when our nation faces threats.
