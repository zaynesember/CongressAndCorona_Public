.@PeteButtigieg apparently not aware this murderer is an Aryan Nation white supremacist who killed an 8-year-old Arkansas girl &amp; her parents.

.⁦@nytimes⁩ let me fix this headline: Republicans Use Democrats’ Own Words and Extreme Ideas Against Them  You can always count on ⁦the media wing of the Democratic Party⁩ to play bodyguard for its politicians.  https://t.co/yLktQPkflM,2019-04-13 11:37:44,Twitter for iPhone,188,697

So the Democrats fanned the flames of the collusion hoax for three years. Now they can’t wait two weeks to protect intelligence sources &amp; grand-jury material? Will they ever accept that they lost the election in 2016? https://t.co/Nkmtzq0nt1,2019-04-01 17:22:20,Twitter for iPhone,148,501
This is true. Russia made lots of mischief in 2016. But Hillary’s campaign the DNC &amp; liberal media were the ones funding working with Russians. https://t.co/Tf7zXL8h9w,2019-03-31 12:28:30,Twitter for iPhone,379,1046

@brithume is correct. Russia uses disinformation manipulation &amp; propaganda to sow discord &amp; strife in our society.

Abortion survivors are not fiction they're real. At least 11 babies were born alive during abortions in Florida in 2017. That's one state in one year. We have no idea how many survive nationwide—some statistics are too uncomfortable to collect. https://t.co/WCELQAoMuo,2019-02-25 23:24:38,Twitter for iPhone,242,574

Tonight Senate Democrats defeated a bill that would require abortion doctors to give life-saving care to babies born alive during abortions. This is a grave injustice.
