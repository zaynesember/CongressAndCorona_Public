As Congress works on a bipartisan border security plan I’m pushing for it to include the most effective and cost-effective ways to secure the Northern &amp; Southern borders — adding the right mix of staff technology and infrastructure to keep our country safe. https://t.co/chEoDEjws8,2019-02-06 21:53:14,Twitter Web Client,6,42

So fortunate that Dr. @PhillyHigherEd could join me for tonight's #SOTU. Dr. Mantella knows education is integral to the future of our state and she will lead @GVSU in making sure students gain the skills they need to succeed and our businesses have a strong talent pipeline. https://t.co/WGuva00h27,2019-02-05 21:52:53,Twitter Web Client,10,87

Great to be with my friend @RepAndyLevin at his Swearing-in Ceremony in Warren yesterday. He’s going to do great work in this 116th Congress. https://t.co/lkwpkjlVBm,2019-02-04 17:43:13,Twitter Web Client,3,26
It is clear that PFAS are a significant health risk. We have to address it. That’s why I’m continuing to work on this critical issue for Michigan families and communities crafting legislation and pressing for federal action. https://t.co/LgySQP4LfF,2019-02-02 02:39:57,Twitter for iPhone,12,66
The Air Force refuses to observe Michigan's water standards &amp; claim they aren't required to help clean up the contamination. I urge @SecAFOfficial to work with the state and come to Iosco County to meet local families and MEDQ officials to hear how this affects Michiganders.,2019-02-01 22:55:00,Twitter Web Client,15,46
The water around the former Wurtsmith Air Force base has shockingly high levels of PFAS impacting the surrounding communities in Iosco County.  But the Air Force has not been working in good faith with the State of Michigan in the decontamination process. https://t.co/i5A1NwyhCy,2019-02-01 22:55:00,Twitter Web Client,15,29
Black history is woven into the fabric of America. It tells the story of how far we’ve come but also how much more must be done to ensure there is equality and justice for all Americans — no matter who they are or where they live.,2019-02-01 21:21:03,Twitter Web Client,4,23
As we recognize this year’s #BlackHistoryMonth let us celebrate the contributions African Americans have made in every aspect of our society.

The PAWS Act expands existing federal domestic violence protections to include threats or acts of violence against a survivor’s pet and provides grant funding to programs that offer shelter and housing assistance for domestic violence survivors with pets.,2019-02-01 19:19:05,Twitter Web Client,7,28

The shutdown had a devastating impact on our economy &amp; many American families. It should never happen again.   I'm sponsoring the Stop STUPIDITY Act which would ensure federal funding doesn’t lapse if Congress &amp; the White House fail to reach an agreement. https://t.co/0t65W0bFGT,2019-01-31 15:36:49,Twitter Web Client,53,252
Collecting this much personal data — especially from children — raises serious concerns about the practices of companies like Facebook. Congress needs to do more to protect consumers.  https://t.co/gpFcBzq5Tg,2019-01-31 00:29:31,Twitter Web Client,5,38
In 2017 I was honored to be named legislator of the year by @VVAmerica for my work to ensure veterans who may have wrongly been given a less-than-honorable discharge due to PTSD can get due process and receive benefits &amp; care they’ve earned.,2019-01-30 23:16:07,Twitter Web Client,8,38

As Ranking Member of the Homeland Security &amp; Governmental Affairs Committee I’m going to continue pressing the Administration to take action. We must protect Michiganders &amp; communities across the country from PFAS exposure.,2019-01-29 15:11:23,Twitter for iPhone,20,91
We know #PFAS exposure can have devastating impacts on human health &amp; our environment. The Trump Administration must take action to protect Michiganders from these chemicals. By failing to do so it is allowing PFAS contamination to spread into drinking water. https://t.co/sP6qmklPHT,2019-01-29 15:11:22,Twitter for iPhone,47,94

President Trump should have never shut down the government. Now that the government will be open we need to have a bipartisan approach to secure our borders. I look forward to working in the Senate to accomplish this critical goal and to ensure the government is funded this year.,2019-01-25 23:43:06,Twitter for iPhone,47,362
These five public servants best understand the danger this shutdown poses to our national security. We should heed their warning and reopen the government now. https://t.co/V6vZZZ7l8D,2019-01-24 23:19:12,Twitter for iPhone,8,67
