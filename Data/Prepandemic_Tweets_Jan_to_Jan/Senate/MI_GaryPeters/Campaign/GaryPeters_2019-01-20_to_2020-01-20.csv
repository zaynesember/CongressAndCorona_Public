There are commonsense steps that we could be taking right now to curb gun violence but Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans have prevented us from even voting on them. We can't wait any longer. The time for action is NOW. #EnoughIsEnough,2019-08-04 20:26:03,Twitter Web App,14,49

In 1963 Dr. King spoke at the Walk to Freedom march in Detroit —a forerunner to his "I Have A Dream" remarks. His message of equality &amp; justice resonates today as it did then.   Let us honor this day of service &amp; his legacy by coming together to give back to our community. https://t.co/K06TAnAh4e,2019-01-21 15:21:44,Twitter for iPhone,2,12
