@repdonyoung @EPA Americans shouldn't have to worry whether the lights or heat will stay on because of a roadblock set up by their federal gov't.

@repdonyoung @EPA A failure in the powerhouse during a subzero winter night could cause significant damage to a village’s infrastructure and potentially threaten lives.
