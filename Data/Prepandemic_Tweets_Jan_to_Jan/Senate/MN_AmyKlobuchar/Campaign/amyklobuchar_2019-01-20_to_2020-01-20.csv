If we want to make progress in our country we don’t just need to beat Donald Trump. We need to keep the House flip the Senate and win back more state legislatures.

The #WomensMarch is a good time to remember the journey that we’re on. The day after Trump’s Inauguration millions of people marched across the country.   Then 6000 women signed up to run for office.

I have a bill to stop “pay for delay” deals where Big Pharma is — in effect — paying the makers of cheaper generic drugs to keep their products off the market.

If our Republican colleagues won’t allow those four witnesses in the impeachment trial they may as well give the President a crown and a scepter.

Some of our colleagues who want free college for all aren’t actually thinking big enough. We’re going to have a shortage of plumbers not MBAs.

Neo-Nazis (or as the president called them at the time “very fine people”) almost killed DeAndre. Only four were caught — the other two are still unidentified. DeAndre deserves justice. https://t.co/dEQ5Aanukp,2019-09-19 19:17:55,Twitter Web App,408,1394

Trump’s policies &amp; appointments (both judges &amp; cabinet) have hurt workers. So when things go wrong he looks for someone to blame instead of fixing it.

A strong majority of voters want new laws on gun safety and climate and pharma prices. To get there?
