Presentation of Articles was a very powerful and solemn moment.  This is only the 3rd time this has happened in our country’s history.

BREAKING: I’ve just released a new report detailing @realDonaldTrump’s gutting of the legal asylum system including first-hand whistleblower accounts showing admin's "racist agenda of keeping Hispanic &amp; Latino populations from entering the United States." https://t.co/53LNYatPcx,2019-11-14 20:55:54,Twitter Web App,1551,2175
On Monday (Veterans Day) the @WhiteHouse tweeted “You are America’s greatest living heroes and we will cherish you now always and forever.” Strange since they're the ones stopping the VA from helping 83000 vets access care for Agent Orange exposure. https://t.co/3lsV0bMO8y,2019-11-14 00:38:30,Twitter for iPhone,1671,2385
Who the hell does this? Trump is trying to price ppl out of coming to US legally by raising fees on ppl fleeing persecution survivors of trafficking &amp; sexual/domestic violence &amp; DREAMers.

FULL REPORT SOON: This whistleblower reveals how the Trump admin asked them and other U.S. asylum officers to take actions they felt broke their oath of office and violated the law.

Ambassador Taylor’s testimony makes clear the depth of Trump’s malfeasance.

The rights of more than 700000 Americans are being denied.  D.C. residents pay taxes.  D.C. residents serve and die in our military.

It’s been clear for a long time that Mueller was unlikely to indict a sitting president. The indictments do nothing to clear @realDonaldTrump’s name. And that’s why it’s all the more important that Congress—AND the public—MUST learn what’s in this report.,2019-03-22 22:24:14,Twitter for iPhone,367,1340
What #Mueller has uncovered: Russia illegally helped Trump; Trump lied about his business in Russia; there were over 100 contacts between Russia and the campaign; and people broke the law to cover up those contacts. That’s damning evidence NOT an exoneration.,2019-03-22 22:24:14,Twitter for iPhone,423,1316
