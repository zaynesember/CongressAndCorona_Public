Let’s be clear: the ONLY emergency at the southern border is the one Donald Trump’s administration created when they tore babies away from their parents’ arms and threw children into cages. https://t.co/OKZvwZHtAh,2019-02-11 21:53:03,Twitter for iPhone,1898,5525
Reminder for Donald Trump: There are laws. And the courts will never allow you to declare a made up “national emergency” for your racist and pointless wall. https://t.co/N1d5FmUVWC,2019-02-11 20:37:53,Twitter for iPhone,121,420

Tonight we heard more of the same from @realDonaldTrump. We heard racist exaggerations meant to divide us and hurtful lies meant to terrify us. I know times feel dark. But don’t lose hope. We have the power to take our country back. Stand up &amp; SPEAK OUT. And never stop fighting.,2019-02-06 03:34:33,Twitter for iPhone,441,1752
The president has an opportunity tonight to explain to the American people WHY there are children STILL separated because of his evil child separation policies. He MUST answer for his actions.  https://t.co/jI1Kol73fr,2019-02-05 22:56:02,Twitter for iPhone,224,568

I want you to meet Albertina. She and her 11-year-old daughter Yakelin were separated at the U.S.-Mexico border last year. Yakelin spent nearly two months in a child detention center.
