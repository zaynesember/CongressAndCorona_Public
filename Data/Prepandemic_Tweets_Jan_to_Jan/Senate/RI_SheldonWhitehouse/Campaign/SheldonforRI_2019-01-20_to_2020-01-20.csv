Nice overview of my colleague @ewarren.  https://t.co/U7PmRnmVab,2020-01-18 21:23:04,Twitter for iPhone,451,1645
Debate analysis on big issues:   Climate change - Did okay with 2 moderator questions and 36 mentions.   Dark money - Never came up even as 10th anniversary of Citizens United comes. Pathetic.   Court Capture - Never once came up; zero terms related to the judiciary,2020-01-17 18:18:04,Twitter for iPhone,2,7
You gotta see this. Less than three minutes long. Wow. https://t.co/1XIuL7zY3h,2020-01-13 15:11:45,Twitter for iPhone,0,2
We saw what the smear machine did to Hillary. We’re on notice. Yet we’ve done essentially zero to inoculate against it. It will attack again in 2020. When will we learn?   https://t.co/3Fnn3hV54J,2020-01-07 19:36:07,Twitter for iPhone,3,3
Polluters spending unlimited secret money to control government is one of the biggest reasons Congress doesn’t #ActOnClimate.    Learn more here: https://t.co/MPBZ4bKsYH,2019-12-20 01:34:00,Twitter Web App,3,3
@JoeBiden Glad moderator @TimAlberta has raised climate change so early on. But any discussion of climate change needs to include dark money.,2019-12-20 01:34:00,Twitter Web App,0,1
One reason I like @JoeBiden’s tax plan? It includes provisions to ensure that the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share. I agree. We shouldn’t be giving tax breaks to multi-million-dollar earners.  My ‘Buffett Rule’ bill addresses that.,2019-12-20 01:26:46,Twitter Web App,39,83
As we head into tonight’s debate I look forward to a substantive discussion about big issues like campaign finance climate &amp; tax fairness. It’s been pretty interesting seeing how closely my priorities in the Senate align with different candidates.,2019-12-20 00:52:53,Twitter Web App,1,6
Yup. We need this. And more. https://t.co/kkUpyRY92f,2019-12-10 17:25:31,Twitter for iPhone,0,3

“Independence” and “transparency” of unlimited political spending were the two false promises of Citizens United. Here’s a prime example of how false those assurances were.   https://t.co/Gim2DxByos,2019-12-09 18:31:22,Twitter for iPhone,0,2

I remember a Republican colleague agreeing with me that dark money was a plague.   His advice? “You Democrats are going to have to raise a lot more of it. Maybe once it’s a tie we can get rid of it.”   Let’s hope this helps us get rid of it.   https://t.co/XvKovMhX8I,2019-11-13 21:45:54,Twitter for iPhone,1,1

From an electronic ad I received. Believe it or not this is the phrase Republicans used for years to oppose and attack Medicare! Their catchphrase was “socialized medicine” as they fought Democrats’ efforts to pass Medicare. https://t.co/Kc3R3X6L1l,2019-10-15 15:02:39,Twitter for iPhone,0,1

So was climate denial so was Hillary’s involvement in child molestation on and on; when you’re propagandizing it just doesn’t matter. Pathetic that DNC hasn’t done more to address this.,2019-09-30 19:58:03,Twitter for iPhone,0,3
Bossert a sincere professional doesn’t understand it doesn’t matter to Trump or Republican attack-and-smear machine that Biden story was “debunked.” https://t.co/w6a4MSELqg,2019-09-30 19:58:02,Twitter for iPhone,2,6

“Any candidate willing to spend four hours taking selfies that’s special for a lot of people.”   Flight canceled Obama drove 4 hours to RI for event. People waited. And it was special to them that he made the effort.  https://t.co/5ncPgDa74U,2019-09-19 15:02:02,Twitter for iPhone,0,1

Dark money infiltrates and pollutes our politics and even our courts. It’s an avenue for both corruption and foreign influence; integrity of democracy is at stake. Number of mentions of dark money in the last debate: Zero. https://t.co/Trsqkdubiw,2019-09-16 21:08:18,Twitter for iPhone,6,11
Big special interests are using the Republican Party to acquire and remake America’s court system in their favor. Everybody has a huge stake in this. Number of mentions of court capture in the last debate: Zero. https://t.co/XBzA0sNNg2,2019-09-16 21:07:53,Twitter for iPhone,5,7

I hope the climate debate is not about who has the most-bazillion-dollar won’t-pass-Congress plan but how we break the back of the denial/obstruction apparatus. Let’s remember we have to win this battle first.  https://t.co/hXa8iL1CxD,2019-09-04 18:04:15,Twitter for iPhone,0,2

Eight years later Workman still remembers how Biden looked at him.   “He has that look where his eyes can see into your eyes” Workman said. “I felt like he really understood.”,2019-09-01 23:22:21,Twitter for iPhone,0,1
Workman’s version is the same but with one added detail. He recalled Biden meeting his gaze. Workman told the vice president that he didn’t want the medal.   “I know you don’t” Biden replied softly.,2019-09-01 23:22:20,Twitter for iPhone,0,1

I hope candidates will use @CNN’s climate town hall to lay out plans to stop the dark money blocking climate action. Any candidate who doesn’t have a plan to act on dark money doesn’t have a real plan to act on climate. https://t.co/oGw0PkrxhU,2019-08-30 16:41:48,Twitter for iPhone,4,6

Debate check 2: spinning into climate catastrophe corrupted by dark money and captured Supreme Court cranking out 5-4 partisan decisions.   Mentions? Climate: 12   Dark money: 0   Supreme Court: 0,2019-08-02 13:48:24,Twitter for iPhone,0,2
Yikes. Not our finest hour. No kudos to moderators. Candidates need to stop making these debates self-injurious for our party. @danbalz nailed it: https://t.co/dliXQSg8Eb,2019-08-01 21:08:47,Twitter for iPhone,0,1
Tragedy of the Commons — Each candidate has the personal incentive to go for their YouTube moment at the expense of our common interest in going after Trump with the result a debate that produces “ugly divisions” internally. https://t.co/yW3ObgrLxE,2019-08-01 18:15:01,Twitter for iPhone,0,1
First debate check: we are spinning into climate catastrophe corrupted by dark money and have a captured Supreme Court that specializes in 5-4 partisan decisions. Mentions?

Oh great. Celebrity journalists get airtime/clicks to ask asinine questions as candidates swing for the fences and Democrats generally look ridiculous. Trump must love our “debates.” https://t.co/UTspTCDasn,2019-07-22 01:56:57,Twitter for iPhone,8,59
Typical. @APIEnergy and Western Energy Alliance are fossil fuel front groups who have no plan to deal with carbon pollution and climate change (other than doing more of the former and denying the latter). But they complain about other plans. Pathetic. https://t.co/21zyvNAsA6,2019-07-19 11:27:08,Twitter for iPhone,0,1
I throw in #ChamberofCarbon because @USChamber (a) hides its big funders and (b) has been identified in a virtual tie for worst climate obstructor in America. When you’re beating @APIEnergy on climate obstruction that’s really saying something!,2019-07-14 01:23:35,Twitter for iPhone,2,5
Actually you could combine this debate with a climate change debate; since corrupting dark-money influence and rampant climate obstruction/denial are two sides of the same oily fossil-fuel-funded coin. Hello #ChamberofCarbon.  https://t.co/yqAnPjnlhv,2019-07-14 01:22:07,Twitter for iPhone,13,30
Steyer getting in is another boost for climate. He adds a climate voice that has been stronger longer than most candidates. Inslee and Warren can stand with him but Inslee hasn’t caught traction and Warren is good on so many issues. Steyer entry imo is a plus for climate. https://t.co/MCvpv2Ojla,2019-07-12 11:26:34,Twitter for iPhone,0,2

“Here's how Republicans can win the climate change debate in 2020”? Here’s why they likely won’t: they have become so dependent on fossil fuel political money. Fossil fuel interests don’t yet sincerely support any price on carbon. Republicans can’t cross their captors. https://t.co/VZ84e4voMm,2019-07-02 21:38:04,Twitter for iPhone,0,2

When Trump calls us socialists remember the last time this rhetoric was used when Republicans tried to stop Medicare by calling it “socialized medicine.” If you like Medicare beware what this rhetoric conceals.   https://t.co/yranWDcKXz,2019-05-02 23:52:46,Twitter for iPhone,2,3
