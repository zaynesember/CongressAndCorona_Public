What we’re seeing from these #DemDebate candidates is what we’ve been seeing from the Democratic Party as a whole. They're grossly out of touch from the American people. They haven’t learned anything from the 2016 election. #DemDebate,2020-01-15 04:01:41,Twitter Web App,27,96
.@realDonaldTrump understands something too many of these candidates ignore: the government does not — and should not — create jobs. Instead we should create an environment that allows small business owners to innovate and create new jobs. #DemDebate,2020-01-15 03:53:30,Twitter Web App,32,93
.@realDonaldTrump puts the American people first. #DemDebate,2020-01-15 03:39:27,Twitter Web App,15,40
You’re seeing these #DemDebate candidates choose a political circus over due process. Remember that.,2020-01-15 03:36:20,Twitter Web App,14,45

If you think that patients should have a choice when it comes to their health care decisions you cannot support Medicare for All. #DemDebate,2020-01-15 03:16:18,Twitter Web App,16,70
