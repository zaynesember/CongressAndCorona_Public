.@nvdems are creating the most accessible &amp; inclusive caucus in the nation.

Make no mistake: Last night’s victories in KY and VA were a referendum on Trump’s reckless agenda. When Democrats come together organize and fight for the things we care about like health care - we win. The momentum is on our side but we cannot let up. We must keep fighting.,2019-11-06 15:47:08,Twitter for iPhone,31,115
El Paso &amp; Dayton - two more communities left devastated by senseless acts of gun violence. As Members of Congress it’s our responsibility to ACT to help prevent these tragedies. But the truth is nothing will change until we elect a Senate that’s not afraid to do the right thing,2019-08-04 14:45:54,Twitter for iPhone,11,39
As the dem presidential candidates head to the debate stage I want to be clear about NV’s Latinx voters: Don’t take them for granted. You have to earn their vote. This will be key to any candidate’s success in our caucus and across the country. #DemDebate https://t.co/7ltDl5fQ2A,2019-06-26 23:23:23,Twitter for iPhone,18,51
Deeply saddened to learn of Nancy’s passing one Nevada Democrats’ most dedicated volunteers. Nancy was always one of the first to ask “how can I help?” She worked hard to get NV Dems elected and my race in 2016 was no different. My thoughts are with Nancy’s family and friends. https://t.co/h31ZrAn1Y2,2019-06-04 21:30:30,Twitter for iPhone,9,47

Thrilled to have my good friend @Maggie_Hassan’s incredible leadership working to help the @dscc take back the Senate Majority in 2020 and #electmorewomen to the Senate!
