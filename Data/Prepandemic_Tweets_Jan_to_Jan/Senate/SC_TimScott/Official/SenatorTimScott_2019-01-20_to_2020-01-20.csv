In fact @WhipClyburn &amp; @RonWyden's will classify 'health centers' as a sin business and exclude them from the initiative. So there's a good chance our community centers and YMCAs are gone. Our after-school programs? Yup they're gone too. All of our children's safe havens; gone.,2019-11-13 20:09:46,Twitter Web App,138,284
Let me be even more clear. This is a state-driven initiative. 96% of zones show NO sign of gentrification. The other 4%? Go ask their governors—most of which are led by Democrats like @RonWyden's. @WhipClyburn and Wyden seem to ignore this fact. Why? Well it's pretty obvious.,2019-11-13 20:09:46,Twitter Web App,144,330
.@WhipClyburn &amp; @RonWyden's bill would END: ✔️ Multiple OZ with a child poverty rate &gt;30% ✔️ Multiple OZ with poverty rates &gt;25% (double their statewide avg) ✔️ At least 1 zone with a senior poverty rate &gt;40% ✔️ An OZ where African-Americans are 20% of the community,2019-11-13 20:09:45,Twitter Web App,143,305
Some facts about #OpportunityZones for y'all:  ✔️ An estimated $63 billion can already be expected to be invested into them  ✔️ There are 8700 Zones with the average poverty rate of 29%   It's easy to lay out numbers but these are people's LIVES that we're talking about.,2019-11-13 20:09:45,Twitter Web App,206,409
