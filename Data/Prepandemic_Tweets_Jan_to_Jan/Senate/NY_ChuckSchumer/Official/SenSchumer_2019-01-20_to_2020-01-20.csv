Now that every Senator has sworn a solemn oath before God and the American people to do impartial justice:  Let every Senator reflect on that choice.

The Chief Justice will swear in every U.S. Senator to participate as a court of impeachment in a trial of President Trump.   We will take an oath to do impartial justice.

Pres. Trump attacked me in a press conference—Let me address that directly  His short-term China trade deal is a loss for American businesses &amp; workers  If he knew what was in his weak “phase one” deal:  He should throw it in the garbage &amp; take China back to the negotiating table https://t.co/7edQaauwn4,2020-01-15 23:55:48,Twitter Media Studio,4130,13334

Do we want foreigners to determine the outcome of our elections?  The House has accused President Trump of trying to shake down a foreign leader for personal gain and trying to cover it up.

If I sound frustrated and angry it’s because I am.  President Trump’s “phase-one” trade deal with China is an extreme disappointment.

250 Days 250 Days 250 Days 250 Days 250 Days 250 Days  Repeat it with me.

Putin's made clear he'll keep trying to interfere in our elections.  But President Trump's fought our push for election security.

President Trump does not want the truth to come out.  If he were so sure that he did nothing wrong he would have said to us: Have the witnesses. Have the documents. They'll tell the truth.  But he's afraid of the truth. https://t.co/nbwQzHnqz8,2020-01-15 00:41:21,Twitter Media Studio,2375,8950

Erratic. Impulsive. Egotistical. That’s President Trump’s foreign policy.  The mothers and fathers of America don't want another endless war.  But President Trump could force us into one or even bumble into one.  We must assert Congress’s authority to stop it. https://t.co/ZW2ZVeaeA0,2020-01-14 20:04:49,Twitter Media Studio,1163,4136

President Trump’s impulsive erratic approach to foreign policy has made America less safe.   The Senate must not allow him to proceed unchecked.

Republicans are so unwilling to argue against witnesses that they can only support delaying the decision.
