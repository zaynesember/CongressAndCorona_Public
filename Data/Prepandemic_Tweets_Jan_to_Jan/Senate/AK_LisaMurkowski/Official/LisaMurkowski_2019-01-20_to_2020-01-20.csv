Senator Stevens was at one point my boss when I interned for him. He was later my colleague here in the Senate where he mentored me and partnered with me to serve Alaska. But above all he was my friend and I miss him dearly. https://t.co/qOXZlCBvbi,2019-10-23 20:59:53,Twitter Web App,4,11
Alaskans are no doubt better off because of the service of the late Senator Ted Stevens who many lovingly refer to as Uncle Ted. But the same is true for every American because Ted’s accomplishments hardly end with Alaska. https://t.co/AFTBQJDAey,2019-10-23 20:59:50,Twitter Web App,3,14
Ted was also a fighter. If Alaska’s interests were at stake he’d put on his Incredible Hulk tie and channel the big guy’s persona. When that happened everyone knew to look out because Ted was prepared to go to the mat for his home state. https://t.co/Wpz7WICeFG,2019-10-23 20:59:26,Twitter Web App,1,4
The first thing to understand is that Ted would work with anyone who was willing to do right by Alaska no matter who they were or which side of the aisle they were on. https://t.co/1MlY8Lm6YM,2019-10-23 20:55:28,Twitter Web App,1,5

Even small changes to improve #EnergyEfficiency can make a big difference. In the small Southeast Alaskan town of Yukatat the elementary school made the change to more energy efficient lighting &amp; saved nearly $70000 a year – enough to cover a teacher’s salary for example. https://t.co/s5ylCndHUs,2019-10-22 17:51:04,Twitter Web App,4,5
Here at home energy efficiency remains one of the easiest steps we can take – and its benefits can be significant. For example the Alliance @ToSaveEnergy reports that 25 million American households have reduced or foregone medical or food purchases to pay energy bills. https://t.co/JtrjFoyben,2019-10-22 17:50:37,Twitter Web App,5,7

In the unfortunate event that we are unable to avoid another government shutdown this legislation would assure that political gridlock does not lead to interruptions in vital health care services delivered by @IHSgov or tribal health entities.,2019-09-26 22:30:28,Twitter Web App,2,13
I'm proud to introduce the @IHSgov Advance Appropriations Act of 2019 w/ @SenDanSullivan &amp; @SenatorTomUdall which amends the Indian Health Service Improvement Act to authorize advance appropriations for the IHS by providing 2-fiscal-year budget authority. https://t.co/zyFuly1guv https://t.co/1CAnwiPuYv,2019-09-26 22:30:27,Twitter Web App,2,5
Government shutdowns jeopardize the health safety &amp; wellbeing of American Indians &amp; Alaska Natives  by causing gaps in appropriations for the @IHSgov. Also short-term CRs cause significant uncertainty in administering programs &amp; make planning more difficult.,2019-09-26 22:30:24,Twitter Web App,3,11
That’s why I introduced the Safe Step Act of 2019 alongside @SenatorDougJones and @SenBillCassidy which requires group health plans to provide an exception process for any medication step therapy protocol to help ensure safe and timely access to care.  https://t.co/DvjbRG9iaz https://t.co/Q5qs205Kqk,2019-09-26 18:49:43,Twitter Web App,5,18
Step therapy can be an important tool to contain the costs of prescription drugs but in some scenarios protocols may result in delays in care or even irreversible damage due to a lapse in proper treatment. https://t.co/5KY53ZdaIW,2019-09-26 18:49:41,Twitter Web App,4,13
Currently when a physician prescribes a particular treatment for a patient insurance companies may require them to try different medications before they can access the drug they were originally prescribed-- a protocol known as “step therapy.”,2019-09-26 18:49:39,Twitter Web App,6,33
Alaskans have a lot to be proud of this #CleanEnergyWeek.

To me Robert Emmet not only stands for the idea of independence in Ireland and America but the idea that we can come together to stand for something – and even if it takes a while get something great done.

In 1966 a statue of Robert Emmet was raised in Washington D.C. Flash forward to 2019 my lands package that the President signed into law in March contained a provision to re-designate that park as Robert Emmet Park &amp; today I took part in the official re-naming ceremony. https://t.co/0uoNWwhIw3,2019-09-23 01:13:09,Twitter for iPhone,2,12

In Alaska and around the country our youth are buying liquids online to refill these pods and cartridges. This not only poses a serious health threat to our children but creates greater access to these highly addictive products for those underage.,2019-09-20 17:09:09,Twitter Web App,3,13
Today alongside @SenatorDurbin @SenJeffMerkley &amp; @SenBlumenthal I called on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to immediately remove all pod- and cartridge-based e-cigarettes from the market unless or until they can prove that they benefit the public health. https://t.co/cBRkZ51H0L,2019-09-20 17:09:09,Twitter Web App,19,79
Mr. Scalia stated that these questions regarding IRAPS and construction trades need careful attention and what the public has to say would be important.,2019-09-20 01:35:49,Twitter for Android,1,1
I also asked him on his views on whether the construction trades should be included in Industry-Recognized Apprenticeship Programs (IRAPs). Mr. Scalia highlighted the value of apprenticeship &amp; recognized concerns that IRAPS might undermine other successful models or lack rigor. https://t.co/NXWxwU41Bu,2019-09-20 01:35:48,Twitter for Android,1,3

This would determine the effectiveness of USDA’s recent labeling guidelines for bioengineered foods. We owe it to American consumers to ensure that the standards put in place for labeling GE salmon are clear effective and understandable. https://t.co/gixDJpZNSv,2019-09-19 22:42:08,Twitter Web App,1,5
Today in conjunction with those efforts I secured a provision in the Agriculture Appropriations bill for FY2020 that would prevent the introduction of genetically engineered (GE) salmon to the U.S. market until a consumer study is completed. https://t.co/gixDJpZNSv,2019-09-19 22:42:08,Twitter Web App,2,5
I continue to strongly believe a clear label is the standard that consumers deserve if they are purchasing a genetically engineered fish. I’ve introduced bills in 3 consecutive Congresses to require the term “genetically engineered” in the market name for any GE salmon product.,2019-09-19 22:42:07,Twitter Web App,2,20
There I encouraged not only Rhode Islanders but all Americans to think about a new ocean that is opening up and as it changes how we need to anticipate and recognize those changes so we can best address these challenges that impact us all as an #Arctic nation. https://t.co/GHKajTUr8e,2019-09-19 20:39:21,Twitter Web App,3,3
Our changing climate means more opportunities in the #Arctic such as more shipping lanes for transit. But we also have considerable challenges such as our lack of a deepwater port b/w the Aleutian Island-Dutch Harbor area &amp; the Arctic Ocean and our short supply of icebreakers.,2019-09-19 20:39:19,Twitter Web App,2,3

In Alaska salmon is a prized resource that fills our plates and freezers keeps us healthy and sustains traditions and ways of life for our families. Wild salmon is the lifeblood of coastal communities whose fishermen help share this resource far and wide.,2019-09-19 17:01:39,Twitter Web App,7,54
The majority of our remote communities rely on diesel generators to power their villages so it’s important that we have policies in place that are workable for Alaskans. My hope is that this bill will be quickly signed into law by the President and implemented by the EPA.,2019-09-19 01:55:43,Twitter for iPhone,2,6
This bill will help Alaskans access more cost-effective reliable energy by hedging back rigid EPA regulations for generators used in rural AK. With winter rapidly approaching Alaskans shouldn’t be jumping through unnecessary hoops to make sure they can keep their families warm.,2019-09-19 01:55:43,Twitter for iPhone,3,7

I’m disappointed we couldn’t come to a consensus to advancing this funding pkg for FY2020. It’s imperative we build upon the good work of the Appropriations Cmte &amp; not let partisanship stop us from providing for our nation’s defense &amp; a much deserved pay raise for our military.,2019-09-18 23:34:09,Twitter for iPhone,8,61

In Alaska most non-residential biomass projects have been for public entities that are already tax-exempt.

We have to find the political will to advance policies that will allow us to rebuild a robust domestic supply chain. Until we do that our nation’s ability to develop and lead the world in renewable energy will be limited. https://t.co/9aP5TvAIy7,2019-09-17 20:37:53,Twitter Web App,7,9
The United States is certainly capable of being a leader in addressing the global mineral demand. We’ve got incredible high-grade mineral deposits and the highest labor and environmental standards in the world. But we need a strong domestic supply chain.,2019-09-17 20:37:41,Twitter Web App,4,7
I often refer to the ‘immaculate conception’ theory of energy – where many people think we can flip a switch and the lights come on or you pull up to a gas station and there’s miraculously fuel there – this is also applicable and equally wrong on the minerals side. https://t.co/bSttHCvbEt,2019-09-17 20:37:40,Twitter Web App,6,3
These minerals don’t just appear out of thin air. They are mined from the ground. They are processed. They are refined into materials that can be manufactured into an end product. We need to acknowledge this. https://t.co/HrWUU5S4K0,2019-09-17 20:37:28,Twitter Web App,5,1

For parents that want healthy meals &amp; clean water for their children— $10 for a case of soda as opposed to $26 for a case of water can be a difficult choice. For hunters seeing Chester 30-gauge shotgun shells costing $22 in Anchorage &amp; $132 in Utqiagvik can be shocking. https://t.co/DaUde1UqLz,2019-08-25 21:17:14,Twitter for iPhone,6,17
One of my go-to stops in any rural community is to the local store to look at the prices of their products.

It’s encouraging to see the success of this greenhouse but also to know these skills are being taught to a future generation of Alaskans. https://t.co/bGIRZpPXxl,2019-08-12 15:36:39,Twitter for iPhone,7,14
In addition to the use of soil the greenhouse grows produce through aquaponics which combines aquaculture (raising fish) &amp; hydroponics (soil-less gardening.) By using a submersible pump water circulates nutrients created by the fish to grow beds to nourish the plants. https://t.co/XIGivyKNqR,2019-08-12 15:36:36,Twitter for iPhone,7,22

During the hearing I questioned expert witnesses on what R&amp;D is happening at @DOE &amp; our national labs regarding the utilization of low-temperature #geothermal energy which can reduce the costs of power generation and provide reliable heat and power. https://t.co/pAEe2AuQMi,2019-06-20 20:12:21,Twitter Web Client,7,17
In Alaska we're fortunate to have broad opportunity to harness geothermal power– whether it’s the string of volcanoes in the Aleutian Islands w/ an estimated 2.4 gigawatts of possible generation or at Chena Hot Springs where they're seeing benefits of low-temperature geothermal. https://t.co/EGqIHTze1h,2019-06-20 20:12:19,Twitter Web Client,3,11
Geothermal provides clean and always-on energy that requires no external backup. We often hear about concerns with wind when it stops blowing and solar when the sun’s not out. You won’t hear a similar concern with #geothermal – these resources are constant and reliable. https://t.co/8cpGTHyP6s,2019-06-20 20:12:19,Twitter Web Client,26,92
