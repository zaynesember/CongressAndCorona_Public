Yesterday the Speaker celebrated impeachment with souvenir pens bearing her own golden signature brought in on silver platters. The House’s partisan process distilled into one last perfect visual. Not solemn or serious. A transparently political exercise from beginning to end. https://t.co/AshajRLH2F,2020-01-16 16:08:43,Twitter Web App,14961,42220
The framers built the Senate to break these kinds of partisan fevers. To stabilize our institutions and protect our country. To stop short-term passions from destroying our long-term future. That is the Senate's duty. That is what we must do when this trial begins.,2020-01-16 01:04:51,Twitter for iPhone,3241,10889
Democrats’ impeachment has been nakedly partisan from the beginning. Pelosi admits it was in the making years before events with Ukraine. Schumer says that whatever happens if it helps him politically it’s a “win-win.” They are playing political games with the Constitution.,2020-01-16 01:04:51,Twitter for iPhone,11750,35211
These two things cannot both be true. Is House Democrats’ case so “overwhelming” that it was enough to impeach a president? Or is their case so weak and incomplete that they need the Senate to redo it? They can’t even stick to one story.,2020-01-15 21:03:17,Twitter for iPhone,3364,9870
Even today the Speaker and her allies keep contradicting themselves. They say their case is already “overwhelming” “beyond any reasonable doubt.” But they also keep asking the Senate to re-do their homework and add to the investigation that House Democrats rushed to close.,2020-01-15 21:03:16,Twitter for iPhone,9349,27449
It looks like today’s the day. House Democrats may finally stand behind the rushed unfair and nakedly partisan impeachment that they themselves delayed for four weeks. The ‘prosecutors’ have finally overcome their cold feet.,2020-01-15 18:47:59,Twitter Web App,6002,22697
It’s clear Democrats see impeachment as one big political game. Sen. Schumer told reporters that as long as the process hurts Republicans “it’s a win-win.” The country deserves better. We’re overdue for some seriousness and sober judgment. That is what the Senate will bring. https://t.co/aZU5pMQ2ah,2020-01-14 23:18:11,Twitter Web App,12697,40427
We’ve reached a simple contradiction. The House case cannot be so robust that it was enough to rush into impeachment and enough for Senate Democrats to start pre-judging guilt but also so weak that they need the Senate to go fishing. These two stories cannot both be true. https://t.co/r3LA9nRhlr,2020-01-14 21:05:40,Twitter Web App,12713,40488
First Democrats spent weeks saying the House case was totally convincing. Now the opposite: They say the House case is so thin that if the Senate judges what the House actually voted on it's a “cover-up."  Their own investigation was so shallow that it now equals a “cover-up”? https://t.co/08ZrAIqqFb,2020-01-14 18:28:54,Twitter Web App,14240,41338
In December House Democrats pulled the plug on their investigation and impeached because they said it was urgent &amp; they had already proven their case. But now they’ve delayed for weeks to insist that the Senate re-open their inquiry.  So – neither urgent nor persuasive?,2020-01-14 16:35:40,Twitter Web App,8062,27100
It should not take brave Iranians to remind American leaders that Tehran has been a force for bad and the United States is a force for good.

If House Democrats were confident their own investigation was persuasive they would not be so desperate to get the Senate to reopen it. The House has signaled they're afraid for the Senate to judge the case they will actually send us. The case they voted for. https://t.co/oqhg2drPdY,2020-01-13 23:37:18,Twitter Web App,7414,24012
I’m glad the Speaker may finally be realizing she never had any “leverage” to dictate Senate procedure to Senators. The Senate was never going to pre-commit ourselves to redoing the prosecutors’ homework for them. https://t.co/DwOeWWvYgy,2020-01-13 22:19:33,Twitter Web App,8271,28936

A majority of the Senate has decided that the first phase of an impeachment trial should track closely with the unanimous bipartisan precedent that all 100 senators supported for the first phase of the Clinton trial in 1999.,2020-01-09 01:45:57,Twitter for iPhone,4820,19610
There will be no haggling with the House over Senate procedure. We will not cede our authority to try this impeachment. The House Democrats’ turn is over. The Senate has made its decision. This is for the Senate and the Senate only to decide.,2020-01-08 21:00:36,Twitter Web App,27157,105867

In the Senate overheated partisan passions are supposed to give way to sober judgment. Can we not wait until we know the facts?

It was sad to see some Senate Democrats rush to blame our own administration before even knowing the facts. Rush to split hairs about intelligence before being briefed on it. Rush to downplay Soleimani’s evil while presenting our own president as the villain.,2020-01-06 23:36:23,Twitter Web App,1522,5614

I’d prefer that we simply follow the 1999 precedent fair &amp; square. That means the question of witnesses comes later mid-trial.

House Democrats are letting their years-long quest to impeach @POTUS jeopardize the #USMCA for American workers and small businesses. They think it's more important to take away the president’s job than create 176000 new jobs for our country? https://t.co/GEr5EfDR6P,2019-11-26 21:26:36,TweetDeck,3738,7571
Month after month Speaker Pelosi has stalled the #USMCA. Lots of talk but no action for American workers. The American people need action not empty words. https://t.co/zvnbhtisCp,2019-11-26 15:30:39,Twitter Media Studio,4550,10657
The Senate has confirmed more than 160 new federal judges since January 2017.

With the “Green New Deal” Democrats have simply taken the debunked socialist ideas of the last century rolled them into one giant package and thrown a little “green” paint on them to make them look new.,2019-03-13 19:31:39,Twitter Web Client,3137,10202
The broken socialist math Democrats are hoping to force on our nation just doesn’t add up. We will never let this craziness get through this United States Senate. https://t.co/a2MfrNwygx,2019-03-12 19:11:49,Twitter Web Client,469,1380
Apparently Democrats think seniors want Medicare hollowed out until nothing’s left but the name. That working families are eager to be kicked off the health plans they chose and forced into a one-size-fits-all government system. No choices. No options. Just “Medicare for none”.,2019-03-12 19:11:18,Twitter Web Client,1656,4229
The new House Democrat majority has wasted no time rolling out one half-baked socialist proposal after another. Apparently the economic growth sweeping across America hasn’t convinced Democrats that things go pretty well without oppressive supervision from Washington.,2019-03-12 19:10:27,Twitter Web Client,3658,12024

Today House Democrats passed H.R. 1 the Democrat Politician Protection Act on a party-line vote. Here’s why that’s bad news for American democracy: https://t.co/y0IpGleXOp,2019-03-08 18:12:28,Twitter Media Studio,4381,6063
Nothing encapsulates the Democrat’s hard left turn towards socialism more than the “Green New Deal”. One estimate pegs the cost of this centrally-planned nightmare at around $93 trillion. That’s more than every dollar our federal government has spent in its entire history to date,2019-03-06 16:10:24,Twitter Web Client,3110,7641
Racial and religious hate mongering deserves swift condemnation. I’m glad the House of Representatives is taking up a resolution to reject antisemitism.

Our relationship and support for @Israel is built on common values and democratic principles. On shared interests close partnerships and deep friendships. The members of the Senate support Israel because so many Americans support Israel.,2019-03-06 16:10:04,Twitter Web Client,375,1682
Taxing more spending more and seizing more power away from the people. That is the Democrats’ hammer of choice -- and in every part of American life they see a nail. They’re sprinting as far left as possible trying to outdo one another.,2019-03-04 21:06:34,Twitter Web Client,4251,13774

Democrats’ “Medicare for all” bill would end Medicare as we know it and force everyone into a single government-run system.

We can’t let any unrelated cynical partisan plays get in the way of finishing the important process of funding the government and securing the border.

It had been clear to everyone that in order to reach an agreement our Democratic colleagues would have to walk away from two extreme positions that had been dictated to them by the far left. I’m glad they did.,2019-02-12 15:32:03,Twitter Web Client,123,797

As I’ve said time and time again: Mindless obstruction is unacceptable.
