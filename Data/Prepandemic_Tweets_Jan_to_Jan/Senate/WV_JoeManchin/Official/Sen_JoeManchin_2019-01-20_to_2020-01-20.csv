The Affordable Care Act isn’t perfect but we can fix it. The Texas vs. United States lawsuit is a threat to 800000 West Virginians with pre-existing conditions. I again call on our Attorney General to drop this inhumane lawsuit.,2020-01-17 01:19:52,Twitter for iPhone,23,51
The bill introduced in the WV legislature fails to account for the more than $1 billion of federal healthcare funding that would be lost if the ACA is overturned.

@SenCapito @SenBobCasey @SenSherrodBrown @senatemajldr On Christmas Eve 1927 the company came and threw my family out in the cold because my grandfather was trying to improve the quality of life for all coal miners. #PromiseKept,2019-12-18 17:14:45,TweetDeck,1,9
@SenCapito @SenBobCasey @SenSherrodBrown @senatemajldr My grandfather came to this wonderful country from Italy in 1900 and started working in the coal mines at the age of 9.    In 1927 he had a wife and 5 kids. He couldn’t pay his bills because he wasn’t paid in money but in company scrip. #PromiseKept https://t.co/Y4xXI3Wk0X,2019-12-18 17:13:30,TweetDeck,4,22
@SenCapito @SenBobCasey @SenSherrodBrown @senatemajldr On Dec. 11 I put a hold on all Senate legislation until I got assurances that a permanent fix would be delivered this year.  And this week we finally secured a permanent fix in the spending deal ensuring retired coal miners won’t lose their healthcare or pensions #PromiseKept,2019-12-18 17:10:50,TweetDeck,1,11
@SenCapito @SenBobCasey @SenSherrodBrown In November I was proud to partner with a bipartisan group of my colleagues including @senatemajldr to introduce the Bipartisan American Miners Act that would secure pensions for 92000 coal miners and their families and healthcare for 13000 coal miners. #PromiseKept,2019-12-18 17:09:56,TweetDeck,1,9
@SenCapito @SenBobCasey @SenSherrodBrown Things came to a head in October of this year.    Murray Energy declared bankruptcy significantly moving up the deadline for pensions.    Instead of going insolvent in 2022 the UMWA pension fund would now go insolvent in 2020. #PromiseKept,2019-12-18 17:08:41,TweetDeck,3,7
@SenCapito @SenBobCasey @SenSherrodBrown I turned around and immediately introduced the American Miners Pension Act with Senator Capito and Congressman McKinley and Congressman Welch to secure pensions for 92000 coal miners. #PromiseKept,2019-12-18 17:07:51,TweetDeck,2,8
@SenCapito @SenBobCasey @SenSherrodBrown In typical fashion Congress waited until the very last minute. But on May 1 we secured a permanent healthcare fix for 22600 retired coal miners.    Although this was a huge win we still needed to fulfill our whole obligation and secure miners pensions. #PromiseKept,2019-12-18 17:07:28,TweetDeck,1,7
@SenCapito @SenBobCasey @SenSherrodBrown In January 2017 I received assurances from then President-Elect Donald Trump that he was committed to finding a fix. But by March 22600 coal miners received letters telling them their healthcare would be terminated by the end of April. #PromiseKept,2019-12-18 17:06:48,TweetDeck,1,8
@SenCapito @SenBobCasey @SenSherrodBrown In December 2016 I threatened to shutdown the government until I was assured not one coal miner would lose their healthcare. Mitch McConnell would agree to nothing other than a four-month extension on healthcare. #PromiseKept,2019-12-18 17:06:17,TweetDeck,2,6

In 2015 we knew the United Mine Workers of American 1974 Pension Plan was severely underfunded.

I'm hopeful the President's statement tonight will allow us to immediately reopen gov put WVians back to work &amp; start negotiating long-term immigration reform. I look forward to working w/my GOP &amp; Dem colleagues to make this happen so that we can end this shameful shutdown.,2019-01-20 00:09:44,Twitter for iPhone,487,2388
