Here is Mick Mulvaney talking about the “legality” of Trump’s actions under the Impoundment Control Act. Whoops. The nonpartisan GAO found that they broke the law by illegally withholding funds to Ukraine. Will GOP senators vote to block Mulvaney as a witness at the trial? https://t.co/2niUmfgvRV,2020-01-17 20:54:34,Twitter Media Studio,246,489
Ken Starr had President Clinton himself testify under penalty of perjury during a grand jury proceeding.   Now he’s part of a team that wants to block key witnesses from the Trump White House from testifying at a Senate trial?  That’s just incredibly rich. https://t.co/9MiKremQYW,2020-01-17 17:01:26,Twitter Media Studio,494,1051
This says it all.   A President who turns to Fox talk show hosts over the Comptroller General of the U.S. for his legal opinions and gets it both substantively and literally backwards—they broke the law and it’s GAO not GOA. https://t.co/HnYvawhHe1,2020-01-17 15:15:53,Twitter for iPhone,83,245
With the weight of history on our shoulders every senator signed the same Oath Book today. We have now pledged ourselves to provide impartial justice—a pledge we cannot keep without exploring the evidence as in any fair trial which requires witnesses and relevant documents. https://t.co/8rQyPP0VPQ,2020-01-16 23:41:27,Twitter Media Studio,77,294
Today Congress received the legal opinion I had requested from the nonpartisan GAO. It concluded that the Administration broke the law and illegally withheld aid from Ukraine. This lawbreaking was part of Trump’s overall scheme. GOP senators must not participate in a cover-up. https://t.co/YbuHhNwzY5,2020-01-16 22:58:05,Twitter Media Studio,1329,3180
When I met with President Sisi last summer I asked him to release Mustafa Kassem. When he refused I worked with @SenatorLeahy to hold the regime accountable for unlawfully detaining and torturing Americans. Trump needs to implement our sanctions and stop embracing dictators. https://t.co/hkO36xR6eJ,2020-01-16 19:42:30,Twitter Web App,86,194
Another big finding in @USGAO's report: The Trump Administration blocked their inquiry—just as they are obstructing the congressional impeachment inquiry—which GAO finds to be of “constitutional significance.” This is coming from Congress’s nonpartisan independent watchdog. https://t.co/znTmqUITjO,2020-01-16 17:37:26,Twitter Web App,484,729
This nonpartisan @USGAO finding which shows that the Trump Administration broke the law is huge news as senators are sworn in for the trial and underscores the urgent need to obtain all relevant documents and hear from all key fact witnesses in order to ensure a fair trial. https://t.co/0RoEzPDxVx,2020-01-16 15:20:06,Twitter Media Studio,482,989
This bombshell legal opinion from the independent @USGAO demonstrates without a doubt that the Trump Administration illegally withheld assistance from Ukraine and the public evidence shows that the president himself ordered this illegal act. https://t.co/bkwyQ4Vk3K,2020-01-16 14:50:56,Twitter Web App,5239,10072
Wow. Watching Lev Parnas interview with @maddow. All I can say is this: Republican senators who refuse to support the calling of fact witnesses and relevant documents should just resign for dereliction of duty under the Constitution.,2020-01-16 02:54:19,Twitter for iPhone,18417,77036
The House has sent over the Articles of Impeachment. Tomorrow all 100 senators will be sworn-in by Chief Justice Roberts and take an oath to be impartial jurors. Let me remind my colleagues: We serve the American people and must render justice fairly at this time in our history.,2020-01-16 02:28:53,Twitter for iPhone,93,391
Mustafa Kassem was unjustly jailed in Egypt for years. His death was entirely avoidable—but instead of pressuring Egypt to release Americans like Mustafa Trump called President Sisi his “favorite dictator.” Inaction is unacceptable when American lives are at stake. https://t.co/1DZpIcdpzU,2020-01-16 00:03:13,Twitter Media Studio,201,358
I will NOT sit by silently as Putin’s puppets use the same tactics they did in 2016 to interfere in our 2020 election. We need to pass the bipartisan DETER Act. If history has taught us anything it’s that time is of the essence. https://t.co/X03Cg9o40K,2020-01-15 18:11:31,Twitter Web App,143,465
Each week more facts support the House case: Trump tried to coerce Ukraine to interfere in our election on his behalf. Republican senators must assure the public that they won’t vote to block additional evidence from being presented at the trial.

It is bad enough that the President is caught lying on a daily basis but it’s downright dangerous when his lies take us to the brink of war. Today he said “it doesn’t really matter” if there was an “imminent” threat.   It does.   We must pass the War Powers bill.,2020-01-13 23:56:23,Twitter Web App,177,601
I sent a letter to @EPAAWheeler with Bay state colleagues making it clear that they have a duty to hold Pennsylvania and other parties responsible for meeting their pollution reduction targets under the Chesapeake Bay Agreement.

Pompeo is blowing smoke. The term “imminent threat” has a very clear meaning in the context of the use of force. And here is a key distinction: not only did the evidence at the congressional briefing fail to meet that test it affirmatively showed there was NO imminent threat. https://t.co/BFiKGaoE7u,2020-01-10 20:23:04,Twitter Media Studio,160,389

The House passed a War Powers Resolution making it clear that Trump cannot take America into war with Iran without congressional approval. The Constitution gives Congress that power to prevent us from being dragged into unnecessary wars by one person. The Senate must do the same.,2020-01-09 23:13:04,Twitter Web App,109,364
The principle should be “polluters pay.”   Under Trump it's become “it pays to pollute.”   It’s the same pattern in his war against science: deny climate change dirty the air foul the water and put the public health at risk so polluters can get off the hook.  See you in court. https://t.co/1ZPmsECxpz,2020-01-09 21:55:51,Twitter Web App,39,147
McConnell doesn't want the Senate to hear from fact witnesses in the Trump trial. But every single presidential impeachment trial in our history has had witnesses. This isn’t just up to McConnell.

Here’s the unclassified version of what Trump sent Congress after the hit on Suleimani.   From all we’ve seen including the redacted parts here and the briefing the facts do not show an imminent threat.

Senate Republicans have a choice. If they refuse Bolton’s offer to testify—they are complicit in a cover-up. This isn’t just for McConnell to decide.

What was Suleimani’s major goal? To drive the U.S. out of Iraq and undermine our influence there. We are accomplishing for him what he and Iran have been unable to do.

As the Senate considers impeachment you might hear Republicans argue that we need to rush a trial to get back to legislative business.   Don’t fall for it.   The House has passed over 300 bills.

McConnell had a choice—allow an impeachment trial based on the facts or join in the cover-up.

Trump's envoy told me Turkey would suffer consequences if it’s proxies attacked beyond Pence-Erdogan "safe zone."  Just another empty threat.

Trump should have stopped after reading his statement. He went on to spew nonsense that 1000s of Turks had been killed in the “safe zone” in NE Syria.   Truth is that he is enabling Turkey’s proxies—many who share al-Baghdadi’s ideology—to ethnically cleanse our Kurdish allies.,2019-10-27 14:48:53,Twitter for iPhone,2225,5035

Since I arrived in the Senate I’ve been fighting to protect our elections from foreign interference. With Trump’s latest scandal it’s even more urgent that we act.

If true this attempt to get the Ukrainian leader to interfere in our elections is an illegal abuse of power. It’s downright criminal if Trump was using $250M of U.S. assistance as a quid pro quo.

We must strengthen our efforts to get meaningful concessions from North Korea. That’s why I’m reintroducing the Otto Warmbier #BRINKAct with @SenToomey.

If this report is true it is deeply troubling. Mergers need to be closely examined and reviewed on their merits—not because the President wants to retaliate against a news organization.

I certainly hope this isn’t true.
