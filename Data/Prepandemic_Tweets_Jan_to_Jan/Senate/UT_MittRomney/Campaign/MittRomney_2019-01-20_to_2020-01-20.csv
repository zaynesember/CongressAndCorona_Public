Prof. Warren’s Medicare for All fails the test: Countries with socialized medicine make their numbers work through limits on care cost sharing and higher middle class taxes. Pretending otherwise is inauthentic and disingenuous.,2019-11-07 14:26:29,Twitter for iPhone,1138,6405
Ann and I are heartbroken for the victims of the horrific attacks in Mexico. Our prayers are with their families who have suffered such an unspeakable tragedy.

While Warren and Sanders push Medicare for All they apparently haven’t noticed that Medicare for Some is about to go bankrupt.
