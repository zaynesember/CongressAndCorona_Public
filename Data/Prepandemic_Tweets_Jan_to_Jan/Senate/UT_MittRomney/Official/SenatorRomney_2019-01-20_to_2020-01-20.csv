I firmly believe we must expand parental choice and create more opportunities in education. Met with representatives of Utah’s Head Start to learn more about their work to ensure Utah’s children &amp; families have early access to the support needed to thrive and be self-sufficient. https://t.co/AQe0h9DFOZ,2019-01-30 18:43:46,Twitter for iPhone,9,93
I continue to believe the premature withdrawal of U.S. forces from Syria and Afghanistan would be a grave mistake that could pose serious risks for our national security. For that reason I will be supporting @SenateMajLdr’s amendment. https://t.co/vzzRzTTLLx,2019-01-30 00:58:54,Twitter for iPhone,98,505
For far too long China has been skirting the rules when it comes to trade and intellectual property. Met with @USTradeRep Lighthizer to discuss ways to keep up the long-term pressure on China to play fair. https://t.co/R9kozEQIpw,2019-01-29 21:53:42,Twitter Web Client,11,61

As the Utah Legislature convenes today best wishes to @UtahSenate President Stuart Adams @UtahReps Speaker Brad Wilson and all of the state’s legislators. May the tradition of bipartisanship continue so Utah remains one of the best-managed states in the country. #utpol,2019-01-28 16:58:41,Twitter Web Client,3,63
Good news→ Utah has two of this year’s top 10 best-performing cities for job creation and economic growth: Provo-Orem and Salt Lake City. The Beehive State is a great place to live and do business. https://t.co/Ix2Aobs8KM,2019-01-28 15:30:39,Twitter Web Client,22,196
On #HolocaustRemembranceDay we renew our commitment to never forget the men women and children including the nearly six million Jews who were senselessly murdered during the Holocaust. Today #WeRemember.,2019-01-27 14:15:03,Twitter for iPhone,58,394
I’m encouraged by today’s agreement which will put people back to work and make sure they get paid. Both parties must work together in the next three weeks on a final agreement that funds border security and avoids another shutdown.,2019-01-25 20:04:44,Twitter Web Client,89,939
Utahns have been clear—end the shutdown and secure the border. I voted today to do both. With both measures having failed it’s time now for Republican and Democratic leaders to come together and negotiate a final deal that funds border security and reopens the government.,2019-01-24 21:42:47,Twitter Web Client,111,1156

Our nation’s veterans deserve the absolute best care our country can offer. Visited the VA Medical Center in Salt Lake City today to learn about the services they provide to the more than 60000 veterans across the region. https://t.co/KfZgyxypdm,2019-01-22 21:16:24,Twitter for iPhone,10,83
My responsibility is to Utahns—to represent their interests and values in the Senate. I look forward to hearing from Utah residents at my first town hall meeting tonight in Farmington. https://t.co/NV2JG8sc0Y,2019-01-22 20:30:47,Twitter Web Client,8,127
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. had a message not of anger or resentment but one of hope and opportunity. He had a tremendous capacity to inspire and uplift. On #MLKday we honor this champion for civil rights. https://t.co/6G5WcZmM2I,2019-01-21 14:01:03,Twitter Media Studio,129,804
