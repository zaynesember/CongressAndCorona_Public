There’s no logical reason why you must have a background check to buy from a retailer but not online or at a gun show. The Manchin-Toomey background check bill will save lives. Had it been law these mass shootings may never have occurred:,2019-08-21 21:33:18,Twitter for iPhone,4,22

The president’s emergency declaration undermines the fundamental constitutional principle of the separation of powers and it sets a dangerous precedent that future presidents could use to advance controversial policies.,2019-03-14 19:21:57,Twitter Web Client,50,373
Well before the president declared this national emergency I made clear that such a declaration was ill-advised. Our Constitution explicitly gives Congress the responsibility to determine how taxpayer money is used.,2019-03-14 19:21:57,Twitter Web Client,24,235

Kim Jong-un's regime is a threat to the U.S. and our allies in Asia. @ChrisVanHollen and I joined @mitchellreports to discuss our bipartisan BRINK Act which gives foreign banks and companies a choice: continue business with N.K. or maintain access to the U.S. financial system. https://t.co/gVhs33rjN2,2019-03-05 20:14:10,Twitter Media Studio,23,62

A bipartisan majority voted tonight to ensure care is given to infants who survive botched abortions. Sadly a minority of senators justified blocking the bill by saying it limits access to abortions which isn’t true. It's about babies who are born alive &amp; deserve protection.,2019-02-26 02:22:22,Twitter for Android,435,1496
Currently there aren’t federal protections for infants who survive botched abortions. My &amp; @SenSasse's bill ensures living breathing babies who survive botched abortions get the same medical care as any other child.

Encouraging news from @POTUS that progress is being made in a trade deal with China. Hopefully this leads to an agreement that stops China’s theft of US intellectual property and avoids a full blown trade war.,2019-02-24 23:21:51,Twitter for Android,23,172
American consumers have paid $13B billion in tariffs i.e. taxes on imported steel/alum and goods from China. They've doled out another $7.7B to farmers hurt by this trade war. Farmers don't need handouts; they need this trade war to end and better access to foreign markets. https://t.co/v1Nxh9UPgJ,2019-02-22 23:08:54,Twitter Web Client,76,271

#ValentinesDay is the sweetest holiday there is. What's not sweet is the U.S. sugar program which forces Americans to pay 2X more for sugar than the rest of the world.
