This weekend we're celebrating supporting our HBCUs on and off the field. https://t.co/7qYEBWUu5F,2019-10-25 21:55:41,Twitter Web App,2,11
"Being around people that look like me that motivates me to be the best version of myself." -- Tamya Jackson Alabama A&amp;M University https://t.co/TIJmTn2PyG,2019-10-25 21:04:26,Twitter Web App,3,12
"My reason for coming to Tuskegee University or an HBCU in general was because the fact of representation not only in the community but in the professional world as well." -- Damien Tuskegee University https://t.co/3hT00MwvMR,2019-10-25 21:03:49,Twitter Web App,2,11
"This was an opportunity for me to learn about my history...attending here you learn more about yourself and grow with your HBCU." --  Alison Alabama State University https://t.co/VqzKThkd3e,2019-10-25 21:03:28,Twitter Web App,2,14
We're fighting for our HBCUs because we're fighting for these students:,2019-10-25 21:03:00,Twitter Web App,6,31
Not only does Alabama have the most HBCUs of any state in the country we have the best. Here's why Doug is working to support them: https://t.co/5i8FvMjgHp,2019-10-25 19:08:40,Twitter Media Studio,60,159
These schools are part of the very foundation of our higher education system and our state. Doug won't stop working to support them.,2019-10-25 18:14:55,Twitter Web App,4,10
That is why funding is critical. The Senate must vote on Doug’s FUTURE Act— which would extend HBCU funding through the next fiscal year. Doug has also introduced legislation to raise and extend funding for HBCUs and minority-serving institutions permanently.,2019-10-25 18:14:07,Twitter Web App,7,14
Not a single one of the over 100 institutions of higher education in the country with endowments greater than $1 billion is an HBCU. Research has found that the average endowment of an HBCU is half the size of similar schools that are not HBCUs.,2019-10-25 18:13:45,Twitter Web App,2,7
Reports estimate that 46% of all HBCU buildings are in need of repair or replacement.,2019-10-25 18:13:10,Twitter Web App,2,10
All of this makes it clear: our HBCUs are absolutely vital. But they’re also underfunded and future funding is at risk.,2019-10-25 18:12:57,Twitter Web App,4,10
Tuskegee University is the only HBCU with a College of Veterinary Medicine A&amp;M is the only 1890 land grant university offering four Ph.D. programs ASU houses the National Center for the Study of Civil Rights and African American Culture.,2019-10-25 18:11:47,Twitter Web App,4,6
Experts estimate HBCUs in Alabama alone add $1.5 billion to our economy.,2019-10-25 18:11:04,Twitter Web App,3,9
HBCUs have trained around 50% of black teachers.,2019-10-25 18:09:37,Twitter Web App,4,7
HBCUs are responsible for 60% of engineering degrees for black students -- 70% of black dentists and physicians earned degrees at HBCUs.,2019-10-25 18:09:23,Twitter Web App,3,8
It’s #MagicCityClassic week y’all which is a perfect time to remind everyone of the huge impact HBCUs have here in Alabama and across the country.,2019-10-25 18:08:48,Twitter Web App,8,27

One of the main reasons Alabama students don’t receive financial aid? The FAFSA form is way too complicated. Doug’s proud to be working across the aisle to change that— because making it easier for students to attend college is worth fighting for.   https://t.co/BEyaPMhqfd,2019-10-24 19:12:20,Twitter Web App,5,19

200 days.   That’s how long it’s been since the House passed the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. When will Mitch McConnell do the right thing and let the Senate vote?  Tell him that it’s time to act. https://t.co/Jbvg7tD2Ep,2019-10-21 23:59:36,TweetDeck,14,43
