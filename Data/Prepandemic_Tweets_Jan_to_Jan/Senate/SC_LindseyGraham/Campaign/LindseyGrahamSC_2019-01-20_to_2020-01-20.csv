At the end of the day this House vote is meaningless when it comes to President @realDonaldTrump ‘s ability to protect the nation and only serves as an inducement for Iran and other radical Islamic elements to  become more provocative.,2020-01-10 00:27:58,Twitter for iPhone,831,2857

@realDonaldTrump Republicans need to get behind President Trump emergency declaration to build wall/barrier.    Looking like he has no other option.,2019-02-01 19:43:00,TweetDeck,3378,11138
House Democrats’ border barrier/wall offer is PATHETIC.   I hoped that Democrats would make good faith effort to strike a deal on border barrier/wall DACA and TPS.   Unfortunately it seems they hate @realDonaldTrump more than they want to solve problems. https://t.co/682AVr78Xq,2019-02-01 19:22:54,TweetDeck,3781,9426

I completely support the Trump Administration’s decision to withdraw from the INF Treaty due to Russian noncompliance.  Russia has been in violation of the treaty for years and the Obama Administration refused to do anything about it. https://t.co/dT1zlUEk1o,2019-02-01 15:09:15,TweetDeck,3775,11314

No funding for wall = no DACA &amp; no TPS.   What a great place the Congress.   Mr. President use your powers as Commander in Chief to build wall/barriers - apparently your only option.,2019-01-31 19:10:02,Twitter for iPhone,10609,34525

My questions and full letter to the FBI Director about the tactics used in the arrest of Roger Stone. https://t.co/y1s67DF3Yu,2019-01-30 22:25:00,TweetDeck,4256,10726
Although I am sure these tactics would be standard procedure for the arrest of a violent offender I have questions regarding their necessity in this case.,2019-01-30 22:15:45,TweetDeck,1767,9210
.....I am leery that a subject of the Special Counsel’s investigation who had retained counsel had publicly stated that he believed that he would at some point be indicted and was apparently willing to surrender voluntarily was arrested in a pre-dawn raid at his home.,2019-01-30 22:14:31,TweetDeck,1964,8874
However while I firmly support law enforcement taking into account threats to officer safety flight risk and the need to ensure evidence is preserved.....,2019-01-30 22:13:59,TweetDeck,827,4344
Since his appointment I have supported Special Counsel Mueller’s ability to conduct his investigation without interference.    Moreover I have always been a strong admirer and supporter of the FBI.,2019-01-30 22:13:00,TweetDeck,802,4184
5) Did anyone at the FBI DOJ or the Special Counsel's office alert CNN any other media outlet or anyone outside of law enforcement that the arrest was going to occur on the morning of January 25 2019?,2019-01-30 22:12:16,TweetDeck,1540,6768
4) Did the Special Counsel's office issue a press release and release the indictment to the press prior to informing Mr. Stone’s attorneys of the arrest?,2019-01-30 22:11:49,TweetDeck,1551,6936
3) Were usual procedures for obtaining and executing arrest and search warrants followed with regard to Mr. Stone?,2019-01-30 22:11:15,TweetDeck,1293,6204
2) Was the manner of Mr. Stone's arrest consistent with the arrests of and procedures for the arrests of similarly charged individuals?,2019-01-30 22:10:30,TweetDeck,1494,6905
Today I wrote to the FBI about the arrest of Roger Stone.    My questions include:  1) Why was it necessary to arrest Mr. Stone at his home in the early morning hours rather than working through his attorneys to permit him to surrender voluntarily?,2019-01-30 22:09:32,TweetDeck,8990,31813
To do otherwise would be to encourage more illegal immigration.    President @realDonaldTrump has been more than reasonable.    The ball is now in the Democrats’ court.,2019-01-29 21:11:00,TweetDeck,1597,6451
I suggest my Democratic colleagues make a good faith effort to solve this problem before it is too late.   * TPS program is going to be canceled unless reformed.   * DACA population won’t get legal status unless we address some of the causes of a broken immigration system.,2019-01-29 20:55:00,TweetDeck,1506,5988
Last time I checked the President of the United States is a stakeholder in the legislative process.    To suggest he ‘stay out’ is a sure way for failure.    https://t.co/15NWirpNHf,2019-01-29 20:46:01,TweetDeck,5496,15188
@realDonaldTrump I’m hopeful we can reach a deal between President Trump and Congress which would be the best way forward.,2019-01-28 15:55:55,TweetDeck,694,4406
@realDonaldTrump Presidents Bush Obama and Trump have all sent troops to help secure the border in the past.    What’s the difference between troops securing the border and troops constructing barriers to secure the border?,2019-01-28 15:55:30,TweetDeck,1582,6173
@realDonaldTrump Question: Can states ask federal government to help secure a broken border that is allowing harm to be done to their states?,2019-01-28 15:54:43,TweetDeck,472,1832
If White House and Congress fail to reach a deal then President @realDonaldTrump must act through emergency powers to build wall/barrier.,2019-01-28 15:53:16,TweetDeck,5588,23247
Hope Congress - in a bipartisan fashion - will work with the President and take advantage of this moment.    Last best chance to take a major step toward fixing broken borders and a broken immigration system.   Thank you Mr. President.    Let’s make this a win-win for America!,2019-01-25 20:18:29,TweetDeck,4979,21093
I strongly urge my Democratic colleagues to work with the White House on a 3 week CR that includes a down payment on wall/barrier funding consistent with DHS priorities.,2019-01-24 21:32:52,Twitter Web Client,2771,11478
The way forward is clear:   * 3 week CR that includes a down payment on wall/barrier funding and Democratic priorities for disaster relief showing good faith from both sides.,2019-01-24 21:32:28,Twitter Web Client,2277,11038

Democrats all-encompassing hatred of President @realDonaldTrump and unwillingness to work with him -– on things that matter to the American people –- will be one of the chief reasons he gets reelected.,2019-01-24 15:03:51,TweetDeck,8432,31115

@realDonaldTrump The State of the Union is a tradition which has been carried out during times of war and peace turmoil and tranquility.    It is an important piece of our history and government.,2019-01-23 21:44:20,TweetDeck,2634,11409
@realDonaldTrump The President – regardless of party – should have the opportunity to address the American people in the State of the Union address from the traditional venue of the U.S. House of Representatives.,2019-01-23 21:43:38,TweetDeck,1495,4831
Speaker Pelosi's decision not to invite President @realDonaldTrump to deliver the State of the Union address sets a new low for American politics.     https://t.co/rkUkTHkxny,2019-01-23 21:42:34,TweetDeck,7897,24086

@realDonaldTrump To reject this offer — Out of Hand — tells me that it is not about the quality of the proposal but Democrats' desire for President Trump to fail.,2019-01-21 00:05:35,TweetDeck,2606,10352
