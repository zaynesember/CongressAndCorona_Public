To prevent future incidents I will be requesting that @Amtrak CEO Richard Anderson meet with me to discuss eliminating Amtrak’s nationwide policy of refusing to absorb any costs associated with reconfiguring a railcar to accommodate a group of wheelchair users.

The Americans with Disabilities Act has been the law of the land for 30 years. Yet in 2020 @Amtrak believes it would be an unreasonable burden to remove architectural barriers that would enable a group with five wheelchair users to travel together. (2/4),2020-01-19 21:05:15,Twitter Web App,86,331

On the 7th anniversary of #DACA we must keep fighting to protect our #DREAMers and DACA recipients. They are our doctors and our teachers our students and our servicemembers.

No family should have to face that choice. No one should have to decide between seeking urgently needed health care—or shelter or food—and getting ripped away from their loved ones.

No one should kneel in their pew sit at their desk or walk down the street fearing that every prayer lesson or step could be their last.  McConnell's silence and refusal to act is as deafening as it is deadly.,2019-08-07 01:55:56,Twitter for iPhone,133,747
Just as Ronald Reagan signed into law a federal ban on the ownership and transfer of fully-automatic weapons manufactured after 1986 Congress can act now to extend the ban to cover semi-automatic assault rifles that belong on the battlefield and not in our communities.,2019-08-07 01:55:56,Twitter for iPhone,83,534
Passing public safety measures to save lives isn’t tyranny it’s common sense. We can’t eliminate every traffic fatality but we require seat belts and speed limits because we know they save lives.  We can preserve the 2nd Amendment &amp; make our communities safer at the same time.,2019-08-07 01:55:55,Twitter for iPhone,48,133
This isn’t rocket science. Every other developed nation in the world has figured this out. We need to keep firearms out of the hands of dangerous people and extend existing bans on fully-automatic weapons to cover the types of weapons of war used to carry out recent massacres.,2019-08-07 01:55:55,Twitter for iPhone,25,94
The firearm lobby &amp; their enablers in the right-wing media Congress &amp; the White House wag their fingers. Accusing us of politicizing a tragedy "too soon" with one hand while accepting lobbyist cash with the other. With mass shootings it’s never too soon—it’s always TOO LATE.,2019-08-07 01:55:54,Twitter for iPhone,20,84
They are gaslighting America &amp; we have to call them out on it.  We’re not the only country where violent video games &amp; movies exist.  We’re not the only country facing mental illness.

I’m angry. I’m frustrated. I’m heartbroken. Aren’t you? None of it seems to matter to Donald Trump to Mitch McConnell or to the Senate Republicans who enable them to DO NOTHING over and over and over again.,2019-08-07 01:55:53,Twitter for iPhone,19,94
When Mitch McConnell saw the tragedy unfold at Sandy Hook Elementary he sent thoughts and prayers. Then called it a day.   Washington didn’t decide to do nothing. Congress didn’t decide to do nothing. One man Mitch McConnell decided that was enough. IT ISN’T.,2019-08-07 01:55:53,Twitter for iPhone,29,94
But the cold hard truth is that as long as the Senate is controlled by Mitch McConnell—and as long as @senatemajldr refuses to allow us to vote—he can block commonsense reforms.  This isn’t about courage it’s about values.  It isn’t about will it’s about votes.,2019-08-07 01:55:53,Twitter for iPhone,23,79
It’s past time we honor the lives of those lost not just with moments of silence but with action.

My heart breaks for the 22 people who lost their lives in #ElPaso on Saturday and for the 9 killed in #Dayton just hours later.

Trump @CFPBDirector Kathy Kraninger is trying to roll back protections from Americans and make it possible for payday lenders to trap consumers in a vicious cycle of debt with interest rates as high as 390%! @CFPB is taking comments until May 15th here: https://t.co/bFLMDSd3Yo,2019-05-10 20:22:01,Twitter Web App,49,61
On #MilitarySpouseAppreciationDay let's all take a moment to recognize the important role military spouses play in our nation's defense and military readiness.,2019-05-10 19:12:41,Twitter for iPhone,55,200
That’s why I am glad the Senate unanimously passed my bipartisan Vaccine Save Lives resolution. This Mother’s Day make sure you are taking the right steps to protect yourself and the children around you from measles. https://t.co/MRVuPt8mR1,2019-05-10 17:53:13,Twitter Web App,31,133
A recent report shows that Cook County is still the most at-risk county for a measles outbreak in the nation. As the mother of two young daughters I know #VaccinesWork and are crucial to our nation’s public health. https://t.co/13lTLWlr9Z,2019-05-10 17:53:13,Twitter Web App,66,179
As a member of the @SenateCommerce I want to ensure that every rail system is equipped with the best #RailTech available. Glad I was able to attend the rail technology expo in the Senate and see the industry’s leading tech first-hand. https://t.co/EaP4rDFYi2,2019-05-10 16:54:15,TweetDeck,10,67
I consider myself the luckiest person in the world because I get to wake up on Sunday &amp; spend Mother’s Day being a mom.   As a working parent I know that making our policies friendlier to working families helps parents stay in the workforce making our nation that much stronger.,2019-05-10 13:44:42,Twitter for iPhone,45,474
Mother’s Day is Sunday! To celebrate I just introduced 4 family-friendly bills. They would: ✅ Make sure no child goes without diapers ✅ Improve childcare access for student-parents ✅ Promote family-friendly workplaces ✅ Expand FMLA benefits to more school workers,2019-05-10 13:44:42,Twitter for iPhone,211,1144
On the first jummah (Friday) I'd like to wish the Muslim community Ramadan Mubarak! Non-Muslim allies can use this month to express solidarity w/the Muslim community by advocating for safety and peace &amp; by challenging ignorance injustice and hatred anywhere it rears its head. https://t.co/h4N3opGLHD,2019-05-10 11:12:00,TweetDeck,119,425
Good news! VA is opening a Clinic in McLean County to help Veterans access the healthcare services they earned. I hope VA takes the necessary steps to ensure the new Clinic in Bloomington has trained Designated Women’s Health Providers. ⬇️ https://t.co/StweG2jwZv,2019-05-09 23:09:00,TweetDeck,37,163
No child should go without the diapers they desperately need and I’m proud to help parents and communities ensure no child does by introducing the #EndDiaperNeed Act with @SenatorCasey today. https://t.co/mpxG6v1D3y,2019-05-09 22:11:02,Twitter Web App,75,400
Congratulations @SenJackyRosen on giving your maiden speech! I’m glad to have her voice in the Senate and look forward to working together to defend every American’s right to quality and affordable health care.,2019-05-09 20:46:21,Twitter Web App,16,137
Enjoyed meeting w/@FAANews Admin nominee Stephen Dickson before his hearing to discuss his vision if he's confirmed. Some of my priorities include protecting the 1500 hour rule to save lives &amp; passing my TIFIA for Airports bill to expand critical investments in infrastructure. https://t.co/jyx3h0bAVE,2019-05-09 17:50:00,TweetDeck,7,33
It’s always good to have lunch with fellow members of Illinois’s Congressional Delegation. Today we were also joined by Mayor-elect Lori Lightfoot. Excited for the opportunity to work together to advocate for the people of Chicago and advance our city’s priorities. https://t.co/JFbxIFVyZ4,2019-05-09 17:49:20,Twitter Web App,16,125
Was great to meet with Mayor-elect Lori Lightfoot today to discuss how we can work together to advocate for the people of Chicago and how Congress can support new investments in infrastructure and ensure Chicago has the resources it needs to remain a world-class city. https://t.co/o23ABMKdT3,2019-05-09 16:20:19,Twitter Web App,25,196
The @ChiUrbanLeague is working hard to ensure disenfranchised voices are represented and everyone gets counted accurately in the upcoming census as the Constitution mandates. I enjoyed meeting with their CEO Barbara Lumpkin yesterday to discuss these critical issues. https://t.co/fGF5ov9Ftj,2019-05-09 15:25:40,Twitter Web App,18,73
Donald Trump can’t claim to be “pro-life” while pushing for rules that endanger women’s lives trying to strip healthcare away from Americans or supporting policies that rip toddlers out of their mother's arms.

Glad I got to meet w/members of @MachinistsUnion and hear what challenges they face and how pension cuts would hurt their families. I will continue to defend their rights to collectively bargain and keep advocating for stronger labor rights and protections for all workers. https://t.co/L04v8ha4KN,2019-05-08 23:38:00,TweetDeck,23,91
This #NationalTeacherAppreciationDay be sure to #ThankATeacher today and every day for being exceptional at helping our children grow learn and become the best versions of themselves.,2019-05-08 22:20:46,Twitter Web App,139,1224
He changed my life and selfless acts of kindness like this are repeated in classrooms across this country every single day.,2019-05-08 22:20:46,Twitter Web App,81,1022
As 16-year-olds we loved him but couldn’t understand why he made us stay after school so often. Now I understand why he made us stay so late. He was feeding us – even on a public school teacher’s salary.,2019-05-08 22:20:45,Twitter Web App,76,931
Time and again my English teacher saved me and a few other kids from going hungry by having us stay and do work after the final bell reaching into his own pocketbook and giving us each a few dollars to get food on our way home.,2019-05-08 22:20:45,Twitter Web App,86,863
I know firsthand the difference a teacher can make in a child’s life. While I was in high school my dad lost his job &amp; my family relied on food stamps to get by. I remember going to the grocery store and counting out the last five food stamps to get some baloney and white bread.,2019-05-08 22:20:44,Twitter Web App,567,2789
Yesterday I had the pleasure of meeting @UChicago graduate @paulmromer and congratulating him for his Nobel Prize in economics. We had a great discussion about transportation congestion and innovation. https://t.co/Ji8o4QueoI,2019-05-08 21:49:00,TweetDeck,10,67
No more women should die from preventable causes on what should be the most special day of their lives. We must pass the MOMMA’s Act to address our nation’s growing maternal mortality crisis which disproportionately impacts women of color&amp;those living in underserved/rural areas. https://t.co/3ULhy0UVmd,2019-05-08 21:29:38,Twitter Web App,64,249
Today we had an important discussion in the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on the meaningful reforms we can take to prevent sexual assault from happening while ensuring survivors are able to heal and resume the careers they dreamt about when they entered the military.,2019-05-08 20:56:10,Twitter Web App,26,189
It’s clear: sexual assault remains a crisis in our nation’s military and far too many of our men and women in uniform do not trust they’ll get the justice they deserve if they pursue it through the current system. https://t.co/Rbep2u2OmB,2019-05-08 20:56:10,Twitter Web App,70,254
Donald Trump can’t claim to be “pro-life” while pushing for rules that endanger women’s lives trying to strip healthcare away from Americans or supporting policies that rip toddlers out of their mother's arms. #MothersDeserveBetter I’m speaking LIVE now: https://t.co/OxfYwkjQrF,2019-05-08 20:04:49,Twitter Media Studio,542,2175
It’s been *one year* since the Trump Admin began separating thousands of children from their parents at the border &amp; w/each passing day it's only getting worse. They have still FAILED to reunite many families they tore apart. We must keep holding the Trump Admin accountable.,2019-05-08 15:43:39,Twitter Web App,182,613
I’m also calling on @DHSOIG to audit whether DHS has overlooked the highly explosive and flammable nature of EtO and the security issues associated with it. https://t.co/xhbuUYIWvd,2019-05-08 15:09:38,Twitter Web App,29,69
The role of federal agencies like EPA is to protect public safety not the profits of the chemical industry. That’s why I urge @EPAAWheeler to use and apply the 2016 classification of EtO to evaluate health risks and set health protective standards and emissions restrictions. https://t.co/Al511sRbjm,2019-05-08 15:09:35,Twitter Web App,39,105
