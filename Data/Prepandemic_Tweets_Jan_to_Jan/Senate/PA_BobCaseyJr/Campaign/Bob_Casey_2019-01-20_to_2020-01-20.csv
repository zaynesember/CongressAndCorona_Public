@JoeBiden has spent most of his life in public service fighting for working families first as a Senator later as Vice President and I know he'll continue that fight as our next President.  The middle class cannot afford another four years of President Donald Trump.,2019-10-23 19:43:49,Twitter for iPhone,1,12
From the personal wealth left to him to the strong economy left to him by the Obama/Biden administration President Trump has inherited his every success. And he's presided over economic growth that has enriched billionaires and corporations at the expense of the middle class.,2019-10-23 19:43:24,Twitter for iPhone,1,7
@JoeBiden fights for the middle class because those are his roots and those are his values.  He's a stark contrast to President Trump who has bowed at the altar of corporations and special interests since the day he took office.,2019-10-23 19:42:49,Twitter for iPhone,0,10
