It’s unacceptable that President Trump and his Administration failed to brief Congressional leaders before last night’s attack. Failing to inform the people’s representatives is a dereliction of duty which over time makes us less safe.,2020-01-03 18:08:08,Twitter for iPhone,181,836
As we prepare for fallout in the coming days Congress has a critical role to play in assessing the legality of the strike understanding its impact on U.S. national security and conducting oversight over this Administration’s actions abroad. /6,2020-01-03 15:53:45,Twitter Web App,21,157

I have grave concerns that President Trump and his Administration have not provided the American people with a comprehensive strategy on Iran. /4,2020-01-03 15:53:45,Twitter Web App,20,151
The Trump Administration must also brief Congress on the preparations and planning the Administration has undertaken regarding potential retaliation by the Iranian regime against Americans abroad and here at home. /3,2020-01-03 15:53:44,Twitter Web App,14,97
The Trump Administration must provide a full briefing to Congress next week regarding the following: - The intelligence used to authorize the strike; - The legal basis for the strike; - The nature of the threat articulated by the Pentagon in its statement last night. /2,2020-01-03 15:53:44,Twitter Web App,28,144
Qassim Suleimani was a military figure who inflicted terror and killed thousands in Israel Iraq Syria and other places. He was directly responsible for the killing of hundreds of American soldiers and civilians. The world is safer with him gone. /1,2020-01-03 15:53:44,Twitter Web App,40,181
By failing to hold Putin and Assad accountable this Administration is letting U.S. leadership erode creating a vacuum for Russian influence. Not only does this make us less safe it is allowing unspeakable atrocities to occur against innocent civilians on our watch.,2020-01-02 21:56:53,Twitter Web App,21,95
These atrocities demonstrate just how ruthless Putin and his regime are and the lengths they are willing to go to assert Russia's influence in the Middle East - and the tragedy is this Administration is allowing it to happen. https://t.co/eVMJDlDpfS,2020-01-02 21:56:53,Twitter Web App,65,118

That being said a 2% drop is still consequential. Research has shown that gaining coverage is associated with a 12% decline in mortality.

More than 250000 adults who gained coverage from states’ expansion of Medicaid through the ACA would lose it. About 6 million marketplace consumers would see reductions in their premium tax credits and consequently have to pay higher premiums.,2019-05-22 15:13:29,Twitter Web Client,16,44

The full name of the ACA is the PATIENT PROTECTION and Affordable Care Act. There is no patient protection in these junk plans; this is just another example of sabotage.,2019-05-21 18:22:18,Twitter Web Client,19,81
These junk policies are being marketed as comprehensive coverage but they were only ever interned to be for a short term or limited duration. Just another example of how the Trump Administration is sabotaging your health care.,2019-05-21 18:22:17,Twitter Web Client,13,52

If we can provide more opportunities for quality affordable care not only will the child be better off but also the parents -- many of whom need child care because they’re working.  https://t.co/cX2ci08ncY,2019-05-13 21:22:28,TweetDeck,34,112

President Trump’s obsession with tearing down the Affordable Care Act not only hurts the 21 million who gained coverage under the law but also creates uncertainty for all the small-businesses who have come to rely on the exchanges for their employees.   https://t.co/VlZEBiCAem,2019-05-11 14:34:32,Twitter for iPhone,72,244
