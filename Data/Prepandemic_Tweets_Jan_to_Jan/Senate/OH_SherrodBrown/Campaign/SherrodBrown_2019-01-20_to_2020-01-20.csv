Millions of Americans don't have healthcare. Thousands of lives are lost each year to acts of gun violence. We could be suffering the consequences of climate change for generations.

The pilot just told all of us that it’s so cold it’s impossible for ice to form. We’re bundled up and ready to go.   See you soon Iowa! https://t.co/kkISGJTrdM,2019-01-31 14:27:39,Twitter for iPhone,131,2105
See you in the morning Iowa. (But first coffee.) https://t.co/loG7WDtEb6,2019-01-31 04:44:07,Twitter for iPhone,61,674
Thank you to everyone who joined us to kick-off the Dignity of Work tour tonight. Onward. https://t.co/wwxyBTMSzp,2019-01-31 04:19:00,Twitter for iPhone,39,288
When you love this country you fight for the people who make it work. And tomorrow we take that fight on the road.  Join us: https://t.co/zfcR2x4n0P,2019-01-31 01:14:06,Twitter Web Client,48,184
I’ve said it before and I say it again to you tonight:   This is our America. And we will never give up the hallowed ground of patriotism to the extremists – not at the Statehouse and not in the White House.,2019-01-31 01:13:35,Twitter Web Client,116,500
And that fight is what this tour is all about. https://t.co/TjzYNebORv,2019-01-31 01:12:45,Twitter Web Client,24,93
My friend Rita Lewis told me they feel like they are invisible. They are not invisible to us. We fight for them &amp; for all workers.   We fight for the construction worker in Manchester. The physical therapist in Reno. The restaurant worker in Florence. The teacher in Iowa City.,2019-01-31 01:11:41,Twitter Web Client,24,109
Even folks with pensions are under attack. Across Ohio and across the country hundreds of thousands of Teamsters miners and others are living in fear of losing the pensions they earned over a lifetime of work.,2019-01-31 01:09:45,Twitter Web Client,32,121
And we know it’s even worse for women and people of color. They face the same challenges on top of sexism and racism that make it even harder to get ahead no matter how hard they work. https://t.co/TieXth7RF8,2019-01-31 01:08:25,Twitter Web Client,40,118
All across the country hard work isn’t paying off like it should.  Corporate profits have soared. Executive compensation has exploded. Workers are producing more than ever before. But their wages are flat.,2019-01-31 01:07:21,Twitter Web Client,37,163
As Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. taught us “all labor has dignity” and no job is really menial if it pays adequate wages.,2019-01-31 01:05:22,Twitter Web Client,26,135
She’s right. And we’re going to fight like hell to keep GM in Lordstown and save those jobs. https://t.co/AUlGW8jViy,2019-01-31 01:04:38,Twitter Web Client,6,49
Last week I was in Lordstown meeting with workers who have been pushed aside by GM. One woman said to me: “All we want is to get up &amp; work hard support our families build a nest egg &amp; have decent healthcare &amp; retirement. But those jobs are getting harder &amp; harder to come by.”,2019-01-31 01:03:43,Twitter Web Client,23,122
We fight for our progressive values. We fight for the dignity of work. It’s who we are. It’s how we govern.   It’s how we won. And it’s how we’ll win in 2020.,2019-01-31 01:02:34,Twitter Web Client,36,223
But we still have more work to do. And every time the Affordable Care Act is under attack you step up. You’ve called and written and marched and shared your stories. And the law still stands today because of your work.,2019-01-31 01:01:28,Twitter Web Client,27,231
When I first ran for Congress I promised to refuse Congressional health insurance &amp; pay for my own until we passed affordable healthcare for everyone. I paid my own insurance until we passed Obamacare. Today Connie &amp; I are on the same exchange system available to all Americans.,2019-01-31 01:00:46,Twitter Web Client,185,1077
Together we’ve fought for workers’ rights &amp; voting rights &amp; civil rights &amp; women’s rights &amp; LGBTQ rights. With your support I voted against NAFTA &amp; the misnamed Defense of Marriage Act &amp; the Iraq War. I’ve stood up to Wall Street &amp; the gun lobby. And you’ve stood with me.,2019-01-31 00:58:36,Twitter Web Client,86,512

When you love this country you fight for the people who make it work. All people. And in just a few hours we’ll continue that fight—together—as we hit the road for the Dignity of Work tour. https://t.co/I4WcpomEaL,2019-01-30 19:58:10,Twitter Media Studio,118,539

When you work hard you oughta be able to get ahead. That's why we need to:  ✅ Raise wages and benefits ✅ Give people more power over their schedules and a greater voice in their workplaces ✅ Fix our broken tax system to put more money in the pockets of working people,2019-01-30 03:17:42,Twitter Web Client,240,1143
Well deserved @chrislhayes. Congrats! https://t.co/693hzbYRBK,2019-01-30 02:30:58,Twitter Web Client,10,144
We've got a White House that looks like a retreat for Wall Street executives. They're not listening to workers. It's time we do something about that.  Join us tomorrow night in Cleveland. Let's do this. https://t.co/fTyCRUGvXO,2019-01-30 01:24:37,Twitter for iPhone,149,718

Populism is not racist and anti-Semitic. It doesn't push some down to lift others up and it doesn't divide people.   A populist progressive policy works to raise the living standard for all Americans—the opposite of what Trump has done. https://t.co/aHC3eRyNCy,2019-01-28 14:22:39,Twitter for iPhone,168,726
There are 1 million+ government contract workers who deserve back pay for the 35 days of the #TrumpShutdown. Passing legislation to get these workers their paychecks is the right thing to do.  Retweet to help this message get to @realDonaldTrump.,2019-01-28 01:00:56,Twitter for iPhone,2929,4562
It's not right. We need to fix this. https://t.co/Rdetbz0l3I,2019-01-27 23:43:06,Twitter for iPhone,38,287

The greatest pain from Trump's temper tantrum is falling on the lowest-wage workers who are invisible to him—employees of private contractors.,2019-01-26 23:37:49,Twitter Web Client,156,720

Americans trying to get a college degree shouldn't be punished with a lifetime of debt.   We need to make college an available opportunity to everyone willing to work hard not just those lucky enough to be able to attend without loans.,2019-01-25 13:10:11,Twitter for iPhone,299,1745
When you love this country you fight for the people who make it work. All people.   We don’t have to choose between fighting for progressive values and fighting for workers. We have to do both. https://t.co/SA145pgN7I,2019-01-25 02:24:02,Twitter for iPhone,125,627
800000 Americans are about to miss their second paycheck. Government  contractors are on day 34 of not getting paid. Thousands more are struggling due to a lack of government services.  This is appalling. https://t.co/omtjFX0Vna,2019-01-24 19:25:48,Twitter Web Client,94,359

The White House looks like a retreat for Wall Street executives.  Meanwhile we're on day 33 of a government shutdown and hardworking families are struggling to get ahead. https://t.co/8S3O6hv9Sz,2019-01-23 21:01:28,Twitter Media Studio,44,209
Too many in this country don't have a paid vacation. If their child gets sick they either send them to school sick or stay home and lose a day's pay.   That's why workers' rights matter. It's why we fight for better wages schedules and benefits.,2019-01-23 16:16:48,Twitter Web Client,141,878
Exactly. https://t.co/v3kbSVQRko,2019-01-23 14:46:48,Twitter Web Client,15,87

Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump don't understand that the 800000 workers who are being hurt by the #TrumpShutdown can't pay rent or purchase groceries with an "I owe you." https://t.co/0VMFV8MRW1,2019-01-23 13:42:10,Twitter Media Studio,104,349

Too many people believe you should be fighting for workers OR fighting for progressive values.  The answer? You gotta do both. https://t.co/KrHmfom89k,2019-01-23 04:05:25,Twitter Media Studio,752,3484

On this 46th anniversary of #RoevWade reproductive rights are in danger like never before.
