It was an honor to talk with Ohio’s own @jaden_reports about the Dignity of Work. It’s inspiring to see that at the age of 11 he already understands the important role journalists play in our democracy uncovering the truth. https://t.co/IismerA6Wt,2019-09-30 20:35:48,Twitter for iPhone,111,746
Week 3: Proud to still be standing alongside @UAW as they fight for fair wages better working conditions &amp; investment in their local communities.   We must keep the pressure on @GM to agree to a contract that honors the Dignity of Work. https://t.co/q2e3J86mG6,2019-09-30 19:11:20,Twitter Web App,104,427
The President promised to fight for American workers — but today’s swearing-in of Eugene Scalia as Secretary of Labor is just the latest proof that President Trump has betrayed workers. https://t.co/T6em6h17e9,2019-09-30 18:14:35,Twitter Web App,255,612
Shana Tova to all who are celebrating Rosh Hashanah. Wishing you a joyous and peaceful new year.,2019-09-30 13:26:20,Twitter Web App,40,308
HBCUs and all MSIs have to overcome enough hurdles every day to educate their students — the United States Senate should not be one of them.  We need to pass the FUTURE Act now. https://t.co/G2Xtoh7IRz,2019-09-27 14:02:35,Twitter Media Studio,32,169
Now @GM needs to agree to a contract that honors the Dignity of Work — and we’ll keep fighting until that happens.,2019-09-26 23:24:04,Twitter for iPhone,21,180
.@GM only reversed course and decided to give striking workers their health insurance after public pressure forced the company to do the right thing. This is further proof that we must keep fighting and holding GM accountable for how it treats workers. https://t.co/gTS9aYqfRB,2019-09-26 23:24:04,Twitter for iPhone,84,374
For the first time in my life I rooted for the Yankees. And then they laid down for Tampa Bay. Is there no justice?,2019-09-26 21:55:09,Twitter for iPhone,47,787
For 50 years @NARAL has helped lead the fight for reproductive freedom for all. Their work is more important now than ever. #NARAL50,2019-09-26 20:54:10,Twitter Web App,39,210
Another example of the Trump Administration proposing a self-initiated flawed rule that will take food assistance away from millions of Americans disproportionately affecting children seniors and working families. Shameful. https://t.co/jY522BGPUY,2019-09-26 19:03:25,Twitter Web App,81,163
We need a Secretary of Labor who will actually fight for labor — not a corporate lawyer.   Eugene Scalia’s nomination is just President Trump’s latest betrayal of American workers. #SecretaryOfCorporateInterests https://t.co/BEO4TRxkxR,2019-09-26 18:00:33,Twitter Media Studio,147,495
We know the President tried to get a foreign government to undermine American democracy. We have a responsibility to find out exactly what happened.,2019-09-26 16:34:58,Twitter Web App,47,378
Hardworking people in Ohio don’t get to pick and choose which laws they get to follow and neither does the President — no one is above the law.,2019-09-26 16:34:58,Twitter Web App,49,392
Our intelligence officials are the best in the world and when one of them is so worried about our country that they risk their career and reputation I take that very seriously.,2019-09-26 16:34:58,Twitter Web App,139,1132
Our staff had a great time at the Mahoning Valley Skilled Trades Expo today. Our factories engineering facilities &amp; construction sites are innovative &amp; high-tech &amp; they’ll employ thousands of Ohioans in the years ahead. I hope Ohioans will explore career options like these. https://t.co/HnpqGv66JZ,2019-09-26 15:50:15,Twitter Web App,4,34
President Trump loves to say that he’s on the side of workers but if he really cared about these workers he wouldn’t have robbed thousands of Ohioans and millions of Americans of their overtime pay. https://t.co/a2Et1aiD9L,2019-09-25 21:45:00,Twitter Media Studio,271,1060
Eugene Scalia has spent his career helping corporations skirt the rules at workers’ expense. We can’t have a Secretary of Labor with a long record undermining workers and defending corporations who have trampled on their rights. #SecretaryOfCorporateInterests,2019-09-25 19:24:44,Twitter Web App,92,333

People who work 50 or 60 hours a week should be paid the wages they’ve earned — period. The Trump administration is breaking its promise to hardworking Americans by failing to stand up for workers and expanding the overtime rule. https://t.co/gQvhKJDWH4,2019-09-24 16:51:31,Twitter for iPhone,80,230

Today we honor and remember the servicemembers who were prisoners of war and those who never returned home to their families — thank you for your sacrifice.

Bryan Paulson’s 4-year-old daughter Chesney had a doctor’s appointment scheduled for next week for her hearing.  But because @GM canceled their worker’s health insurance without notice her parents won’t know if the tubes in her ears are okay. https://t.co/gkHYO0CJNb,2019-09-18 21:59:16,Twitter for iPhone,54,164

This is Randy from @UAW Local 14 in Toledo. His son has a doctors appointment today but Randy doesn’t know if he can go because @GM cut off his insurance without warning — health insurance he worked hard to earn.   These dirty tactics have to stop. https://t.co/6VI5BBoIuV,2019-09-17 21:23:33,Twitter for iPhone,200,409
President Trump’s attacks on women’s health has real consequences.   Two Planned Parenthood clinics in Cincinnati will be forced to close their doors — this will be devastating for so many Southwest Ohio women. #SaveTitleX https://t.co/OrctHBvexM,2019-09-17 14:29:05,Twitter Media Studio,177,495
Let’s be clear: Autoworkers are the engine behind GM’s success.   GM needs to agree to a contract that honors the Dignity of Work and recognizes the autoworkers communities and families who all help drive the success of the auto industry in Ohio and across the country. https://t.co/qI5Vr6Re54,2019-09-16 22:59:11,Twitter Media Studio,260,946

According to a @CFPB report released several years ago 4 out of 5 people who got a payday loan either had to get another loan to pay off the first or they defaulted.

"..if Murphy had been successful John and I and...couples like us would have been denied the right to marry &amp; forced to live as 2nd-class citizens." - @JimObergefell  Eric Murphy worked to strip Ohioans of their rights.

Democrats and Republicans agree we need to work together to secure our borders and we should work together to fix our broken immigration system. I hope the President has learned that he cannot hold the paychecks of American workers hostage in that process. -SB,2019-01-25 20:48:39,Twitter Web Client,92,647

Governor DeWine’s decision is reckless and it will hurt Ohio women.    We’ll fight this at every turn. Women not politicians should have the freedom to make personal private health decisions for themselves. -SB https://t.co/Wjjef6sOvY,2019-01-24 23:35:13,Twitter Web Client,735,2638
“It’s disgusting elected officials are telling us ‘to go mow somebody’s lawn.’ I mean come on. If we don’t do our job we’d get fired out in the market right?

I’m calling on Mitch McConnell Donald Trump &amp; my GOP colleagues to listen to the hardworking Americans who are suffering under this unnecessary &amp; avoidable shutdown.

Chad Readler and Eric Murphy are just as unqualified to sit on the federal bench now as they were the first time President Trump nominated them. These nominees actively worked to strip Ohioans of their rights – they have no place on the Sixth Circuit. https://t.co/l2B6Fz0Ntd,2019-01-24 17:25:12,Twitter Web Client,273,744
Thanks to @RevJJackson for standing with the Toledo community in the wake of the racist acts at the GM plant.

Missing 1 paycheck may not seem like a lot to the billionaire president &amp; his multi-millionaire cabinet. But for most Americans missing a paycheck is a big deal.

Joined workers in Lordstown this #MLKDay.
