We have a chance to choose a strong all-above strategy to keep pace with changes at the border. Making that choice should not be political.

Beginning in the early 1990s we built barriers in 4 sectors at our southern border. Since each was built those sectors have seen massive drops in apprehensions of people crossing the border illegally. Let’s admit that physical barriers need to be a part of the solution. https://t.co/obJZzvtlTX,2019-01-30 17:44:21,Twitter Web Client,37,96
Most importantly I had a chance to extend my thanks to these leaders and to the men and women of their organizations. They performed their duties w/o pay during the shutdown. Their commitment to their mission never waned.,2019-01-30 16:04:41,Twitter Web Client,6,17
I heard directly from CBP that they can’t do their jobs as effectively w/o physical barriers.

The president’s proposal represents an honest effort to reopen the government and strengthen border security—a good faith offer that includes both Republican and Democrat priorities.,2019-01-24 18:54:40,Twitter Web Client,18,58
GOP BILL: End the Shutdown and Secure the Border Act (aka @POTUS’ proposal) would immediately reopen the closed portions of the government and fund border security.  DEM BILL: Would fund the government through February 8 without funding for any physical barrier at the border. https://t.co/CwXel8HQrG,2019-01-24 18:54:40,Twitter Web Client,76,132
