Check out why my legislation is critical to protecting Americans' personal data. #DemCast https://t.co/NgBo7DkvNh,2019-10-29 15:08:32,TweetDeck,2,3
I agree completely with @EdMarkey about our friend @EnesKanter — no person in our country should be harassed for practicing their faith. https://t.co/icyvHBqlM6,2019-10-07 18:38:49,Twitter Web App,160,287
The FBI failed to investigate the allegations against Brett Kavanaugh and America's democracy is paying the price.  Congress must conduct a thorough investigation as soon as possible. We can't let Trump and McConnell continue to hijack our nation's judicial system.,2019-09-16 21:39:31,TweetDeck,5,16
McConnell is choosing inaction over action when it comes to reducing senseless gun violence. I stand with @MomsDemand to send this message to Mitch McConnell: you can't put your head in the sand and hope this issue goes away. We will keep demanding action. https://t.co/99DLS9VYwg,2019-08-22 17:44:00,Twitter Web App,2,6
Mitch McConnell has spent his time in Congress fighting for special interests and corporations. @AmyMcGrathKY is the champion of working families we need to replace McConnell in the Senate.   If you agree that it's time for McConnell to go contribute now: https://t.co/jlnMPcHbeS,2019-07-11 16:19:55,Twitter Web Client,7,8
The only way to ensure ironclad protections for pre-existing conditions is by voting Trump and ALL down-ballot Republicans out of office in 2020. They need to hear the message loud and clear: protect our care.,2019-07-09 20:47:19,Twitter Web Client,1,2
Republicans have made it clear they're not the party of health care they're the party of putting special interests and insurance companies in the driver's seat when it comes to your care.,2019-07-09 20:47:19,Twitter Web Client,2,5
The Republicans' war on health care coverage continues. The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals is now hearing arguments in Texas v. U.S. the landmark GOP-led lawsuit that could make or break coverage for Americans with pre-existing conditions under the ACA. https://t.co/sOmVSXCL4j,2019-07-09 20:47:18,Twitter Web Client,1,1
Make sure to return your ballot by 8 p.m. tonight to have your voice heard. The foundation of our democracy depends on it.,2019-05-21 20:11:30,Twitter Web Client,1,6
It's Election Day in Oregon. Safeguarding progressive values starts with electing leaders at the local level who will fight to preserve access to quality affordable health care support quality education protect our clean air &amp; water &amp; create opportunities for working families. https://t.co/MRbNZUKUvG,2019-05-21 20:11:30,Twitter Web Client,4,9
This is a record low even for the Trump administration and why I called on McConnell to delay Bernhardt's confirmation vote. Republicans forced this nomination through the Senate despite knowing Bernhardt's troubled past. Now it's time for the American people to get answers.,2019-04-17 01:32:15,Twitter Web Client,0,1
One business day. That's how long Trump's newest Secretary of the Interior was on the job before a formal investigation was launched into his misconduct and conflicts of interest. https://t.co/kr02Ps9sfg,2019-04-17 01:32:15,Twitter Web Client,2,7
Thanks to @NWGSDPDX and @Indivisible_OR for organizing this week's #releasethereport rally in Portland. Great to see so many activists and community leaders united in this fight to make sure the truth gets to the American people. https://t.co/Duy6gDx9Pp,2019-04-06 23:48:32,Twitter Web Client,15,32
Climate change is real and communities in Oregon and across the globe are feeling its consequences. McConnell needs to stop with the political games and allow for a real debate on solutions to save our future.,2019-03-27 18:25:48,Twitter Web Client,4,9
It's time for a #GreenNewDeal because climate change is an urgent threat that demands bold action. McConnell has done nothing but make a mockery of the issue holding sham debates on the Senate floor &amp; looking for every opportunity to attack climate action.https://t.co/PeOvaol9E9,2019-03-27 18:25:48,Twitter Web Client,6,14
Deeply saddened over the news coming out of New Zealand today. No one should feel unsafe in their house of worship. Today and everyday we must stand up to those that seek to divide us and remember that welcoming everyone regardless of faith is what truly unites us.,2019-03-15 20:28:07,Twitter Web Client,1,9
In 2006 I was the first Senator to introduce legislation to protect #NetNeutrality. This week I rolled out new legislation to put real Net Neutrality rules back on the books and fight the Trump administration's attempts to give a handout to Big Cable. https://t.co/nDIJMvVvzs,2019-03-07 21:24:34,TweetDeck,2,8
This rule threatens vital health care resources for millions of Americans hitting low-income communities and communities of color the hardest. I couldn't be prouder that Oregon is leading the fight to put an end to the Trump administration's latest attack on reproductive health. https://t.co/0DNwKNLpUg,2019-03-05 17:35:57,Twitter Web Client,3,10
Yesterday execs from Big Pharma came before Congress and attempted to justify the increasing cost of prescription drugs. What I heard was little more than excuses for greed on the part of these drug makers. https://t.co/XubmXDf0NS,2019-02-27 20:58:58,TweetDeck,4,7
Tomorrow CEOs from seven of the largest Pharma companies will testify before Congress about the skyrocketing cost of prescription drugs. For too long these companies and their CEOs have been driving up prices in order to line their own pockets. Enough is enough. https://t.co/s6qCLJaIXX,2019-02-26 02:10:16,Twitter Web Client,1,2
Let's be perfectly clear about what's happening: this is another politically motivated attack by the Trump administration threatening access to critical health care resources for millions of low income Americans across the country. This is shameful. #NoGagRule https://t.co/dJGUNxxn0c,2019-02-22 21:52:47,Twitter Web Client,2,7
Today marks one year since the #ParklandSchoolShooting and Congress has yet to take real action to end senseless gun violence. It's past time that Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell does his job by bringing legislation to the Senate floor to protect American families.,2019-02-14 22:14:04,TweetDeck,0,3
The Senate just passed a bipartisan bill that includes critical protections for some of Oregon's most beloved public lands.  I will keep up the fight to ensure that we preserve these public resources but today is a major victory and step forward. https://t.co/2NTuy58tXO,2019-02-12 23:32:22,TweetDeck,0,3
It's time for the federal government to respect the will of the voters in Oregon and across the country by ending failed prohibition of marijuana. My bill would do just that. https://t.co/IcdJEEXQjQ,2019-02-11 18:24:24,Twitter Web Client,44,122
Today I joined my colleagues in Congress to call for a #GreenNewDeal. Americans want clean air and water and good-paying sustainable jobs. That starts with throwing out the tax breaks for Big Oil that stifle sustainable job growth and innovation. https://t.co/UgZpKRGWMQ,2019-02-07 22:48:53,TweetDeck,3,9
It is unprecedented to hear a United States president try to convince Congress and the American people to grant him unchecked power.  Here’s the bottom line: no one is above the law not even the president. #SOTU,2019-02-06 16:07:36,Twitter Web Client,0,4
It's time to hold Big Pharma accountable for price gouging American families and driving up the cost of life-saving prescription drugs. They will answer to Congress and the American people whether they want to or not. https://t.co/jGoAzUC2J0,2019-02-05 18:25:02,Twitter Web Client,0,2
