No more corporate race to the bottom coming at the expense of America’s middle class.

The version of NAFTA the Trump administration released in 2018 was fundamentally flawed and weak on enforcement.

Trump and Ajit Pai have made it perfectly clear they won’t rest when it comes to giving a handout to Big Cable.

In 2006 I introduced the first bill in the Senate to protect #NetNeutrality because I believe that once you’ve paid your internet access fee you should get to go where you want when you want and how you want on the internet. #SaveTheInternet,2019-06-11 16:44:34,Twitter Web App,57,153
@senatemajldr Republicans want American consumers to believe that the sky isn’t falling by repealing #NetNeutrality. Here’s the reality: these changes hurting consumers won’t come all at once.

The solution to fixing health care in this country is NOT lowering standards so more people are left out.,2019-05-22 17:04:28,Twitter for iPhone,46,194
This change would mean 300000 children kicked off their health coverage. 250000 seniors and people with disabilities would lose access to affordable drugs. Hundreds of thousands of working parents and seniors barely getting by would be hit with higher health costs.,2019-05-22 17:04:27,Twitter for iPhone,57,150

Here's what the abortion debate is really about: Republicans are insisting on government control of women’s bodies.  Access to abortion is a critical part of reproductive health care.

Barr:  ✔️Created a mass surveillance program ✔️Wants the government to have more surveillance power with no oversight ✔️Thinks torture is fine  ✔️OK'd pardons for people who illegally sold weapons to Iran  To say he’s against abuse of government power is stunningly hypocritical.,2019-04-10 17:00:22,Twitter for iPhone,2112,3758

With profits to be made Big Pharma isn’t going to start self-policing its pricing practices.

Last year the Senate voted on a bipartisan basis to throw out Trump’s #DarkMoney rule. I hope this time around Senate Republicans will support this legislation to increase transparency in our elections &amp; take our democracy back from over powerful insiders &amp; foreign meddlers.,2019-01-31 17:44:10,Twitter Web Client,51,152
In a gift to foreign meddlers and special interests the Trump administration has turned a blind eye to illegal campaign spending in America. @SenatorTester and I are fighting back with legislation that would shine a light on #DarkMoney. https://t.co/spdMuVMlWC,2019-01-31 17:44:10,Twitter Web Client,137,283
I’m calling on @Interior and @USDA to distribute federal funds for schools and infrastructure projects that were delayed during the #TrumpShutdown leaving rural communities in Oregon and across the country hamstrung. https://t.co/3wvCFFuZQQ,2019-01-30 23:41:18,Twitter for iPhone,55,143
I grew up witnessing the gender pay gap firsthand. My mother was a librarian and despite working just as hard as her male colleagues she never earned the same paycheck. I will keep fighting to ensure that women aren’t cheated out of the resources they need for their futures.,2019-01-30 19:09:36,Twitter Web Client,45,217
It's outrageous that today many women are not earning equal pay for equal work. When women succeed in the workplace everyone benefits. I'm cosponsoring the #PaycheckFairness Act to guarantee that women are able to hold their employers accountable if they don't earn #EqualPay.,2019-01-30 19:09:36,Twitter Web Client,66,286

Great meeting with @OSBANews today to discuss the importance of funding key education programs investing in our rural schools &amp; innovative ways to increase graduation rates across the state of Oregon.

ICYMI: With the decision in #SouthCarolina last week the Trump administration made it clear it would rather green light discrimination over the best interests of vulnerable kids. I will continue fighting this immoral policy. https://t.co/P5XzjYseEz,2019-01-29 18:37:35,Twitter Web Client,105,299

Pharma companies claim they want to make their products affordable for everyone but they couldn’t be bothered to show up today to discuss how we can make that a reality. Today’s hearing is just the beginning as the @SenateFinance committee tackles rising drug costs.,2019-01-29 16:38:17,Twitter Web Client,77,281
This morning @SenateFinance held a hearing to address skyrocketing prescription drug prices but not a single one of the largest drug companies were willing to testify. In 1994 even the Big Tobacco CEOs were willing to come to Congress and testify. https://t.co/5iv8FiKqVb,2019-01-29 16:37:15,Twitter Media Studio,276,561
The #TrumpShutdown created regulatory paralysis for craft beverage producers across Oregon. @repblumenauer &amp; I are calling on federal regulators to work through their backlog of paperwork to help small businesses left hamstrung by Trump’s political games. https://t.co/IBcyO7LHjI,2019-01-28 23:03:31,Twitter Web Client,39,95

Ending the #TrumpShutdown means relief for the thousands of federal workers who are struggling to put food on the table and the taxpayers who rely on the vital work they do.

One more Oregon casualty of this month-long &amp; senseless #TrumpShutdown is damage to job-creating start-up businesses like this one in Portland: https://t.co/m8ywKiGiVr,2019-01-25 17:20:30,Twitter Web Client,53,130

Trump isn’t offering a compromise. He’s adding to his list of demands.   The Trump/McConnell bill would gut DACA &amp; put harsh restrictions on those seeking safety &amp; asylum in America.
