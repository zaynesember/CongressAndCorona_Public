My friends in the House have this right: if we’re going to ask the men and women of our armed forces to put themselves in harm’s way we owe them both support and clarity of mission.

Today my colleagues and I swear an oath to do impartial justice in the impeachment trial.

Acosta was never fit to serve in the Cabinet — his departure is the right thing for our country.
