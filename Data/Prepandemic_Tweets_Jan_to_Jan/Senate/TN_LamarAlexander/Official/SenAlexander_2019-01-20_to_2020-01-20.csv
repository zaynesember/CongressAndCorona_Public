Just because the U.S. House was a circus doesn't mean the Senate needs to be.   We're approaching the impeachment trial according to our constitutional responsibilities—assuring the American people that we're giving the articles from the House a full and fair hearing. https://t.co/WwV38DR0WU,2020-01-16 19:39:33,Twitter Media Studio,127,578
I just voted for and the U.S. Senate just passed #USMCA.   This is very good news for Tennessee workers especially autoworkers because the trade agreement preserves elimination of tariffs which has helped Tennessee nearly triple its auto jobs since #NAFTA was enacted in 1994. https://t.co/Xpq8AkcRGj,2020-01-16 17:21:28,Twitter Media Studio,46,149
Great to have @SenatorLoeffler at her first HELP Committee hearing today!    I look forward to working with her to lower what Americans pay out of their own pockets for health care and to make a college education worth students time and money. https://t.co/PvftaLkxAr,2020-01-15 21:03:29,Twitter for iPhone,7,62
This agreement has overwhelming bipartisan support.   #USMCA will continue to raise family incomes and create even more good-paying jobs.,2020-01-15 15:13:11,Twitter for iPhone,3583,12976
The reason this committee is voting on the #USMCA is because it includes a section covering labor provisions. Among these are provisions to improve workers’ rights by granting the U.S. new enforcement authorities and holding Mexico accountable for improving workers’ rights.,2020-01-15 15:13:11,Twitter for iPhone,3649,13265
This agreement as well as the first agreement with China the president is expected to sign today both contribute to that certainty.,2020-01-15 15:13:10,Twitter for iPhone,37,131
Almost as important is the certainty that this trade agreement brings to Tennessee manufacturers about what the rules of the road are. In fact the single most important step the U.S. could take in 2020 to further improve a growing economy is certainty in our trade agreements.,2020-01-15 15:13:10,Twitter for iPhone,30,119
Tariffs are taxes plain and simple – and #USMCA is fundamentally a zero tariff trade agreement.,2020-01-15 15:13:10,Twitter for iPhone,34,129
I believe the president’s stated goal of “zero tariffs zero non-tariff barriers and zero subsidies” is exactly the right goal for Tennessee’s auto industry manufacturers and farmers.,2020-01-15 15:13:09,Twitter for iPhone,37,137
The update to NAFTA that we are voting on today maintains that zero tariff agreement. I support the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement – which is being called the #USMCA.,2020-01-15 15:13:09,Twitter for iPhone,40,140
Even though there are more auto jobs in Mexico today the number of auto jobs in the United States is about the same as in 1994 – there are just more auto jobs in the Southeast. In 1980 there were only three automotive assembly plants in the Southeast. In 2018 there were 16.,2020-01-15 15:13:09,Twitter for iPhone,32,120
As a result of this zero tariff trade agreement with Mexico and Canada the last 26 years have been good for Tennessee workers.,2020-01-15 15:13:08,Twitter for iPhone,30,127
One of the reasons Tennessee has been able to have so much success building cars and SUVs is because over time NAFTA became a zero tariff trade agreement.,2020-01-15 15:13:08,Twitter for iPhone,34,134
More than 140000 Tennesseans – one third of our state’s manufacturing jobs – work in the automotive industry at plants and suppliers in 88 of our 95 counties.,2020-01-15 15:13:07,Twitter for iPhone,43,154
Over 40 years ago Tennessee had hardly any auto jobs. When the North American Free Trade Agreement – NAFTA – was adopted in 1994 Tennessee had about 51000 auto jobs. Today there are nearly three times as many.,2020-01-15 15:13:07,Twitter for iPhone,54,186
I’m about to chair the Senate HELP Committee’s executive session to vote on #USMCA.   Updating #NAFTA makes sense and this agreement good news for Tennessee auto workers and farmers.   You can watch live here: https://t.co/u0cPOEBlvH,2020-01-15 15:01:52,Twitter for iPhone,4252,16240
The rule gives businesses and workers a clear standard as to whether employees have two different employers.  I commend @SecGeneScalia and the Administration for helping solve this problem for the owners of 733000 franchise locations including the 17000 in Tennessee.,2020-01-13 14:44:10,Twitter Web App,4,3
The new joint employer rule from @USDOL will help restore to franchise owners—those who are hurt the most by the current patchwork of joint employer standards—the opportunity to make their way into the middle class.   https://t.co/yMdGUL0i9b,2020-01-13 14:44:10,Twitter Web App,3,6
Such a great game @Titans! #TitanUp https://t.co/jaeFvaI3lT,2020-01-12 05:14:02,Twitter for iPhone,6,87
It should quickly be considered by the U.S. House so it can be sent to @POTUS and signed into law.,2020-01-10 15:47:34,Twitter Web App,2,6
This bipartisan bill will allow the Secretary of @HHSGov to create a ready reserve of public health professionals to ensure we are prepared to respond to a national or public health emergency.,2020-01-10 15:47:33,Twitter Web App,4,8
The U.S. Senate passed the Public Health Service Modernization Act of 2019—introduced by @SenatorRounds and @SenDougJones—which was approved by the HELP Committee I chair.,2020-01-10 15:47:32,Twitter Web App,13,20
This Congress @MarshaBlackburn and I introduced a bill to award the Congressional Gold Medal to MSG “Roddie” Edmonds a lifelong Tennessean because I do not know of a more inspiring example of the American character than the heroism of this 26-year-old East Tennessee soldier. https://t.co/6Hhg5dTnLh,2020-01-09 21:39:59,Twitter Web App,1297,3366

I look forward to working with Brad to give Americans better health care outcomes better experiences at lower costs.,2020-01-06 20:52:46,Twitter Web App,2,9
Today @POTUS appointed Brad Smith to serve as the director for @CMSinnovates. Brad has exactly the right experience to lead a center charged with coming up with innovative ways to lower health care costs and improve quality.   https://t.co/QMNZ7WxxqW,2020-01-06 20:52:45,Twitter Web App,4,17

.@DrPhilRoe has been a champion for veterans for students and for common sense in government.   His background as a practicing physician has been crucial to our work to #lowerhealthcarecosts.

Yesterday the U.S. Senate passed the Promoting Physical Activity for Americans Act—introduced by @SenatorWicker and @SenSherrodBrown. It requires the @HHSGov to periodically update its recommendations on exercise.,2019-12-20 18:43:52,Twitter for iPhone,2,15
Thank you @BetsyDeVosED this is an example of the leadership you @stevenmnuchin1 and the @realDonaldTrump Administration bring to the American people.

It is time to stop studying the issue of exorbitant air ambulance charges and take action. Our legislation will treat air ambulances the same as health care providers – by using the local commercial market-based rate for in-network health care.,2019-06-26 15:50:00,Twitter for iPhone,1,1
We have also extended this protection to air ambulances because according to the @USGAO nearly 70% of air ambulance transports were out-of-network in 2017 &amp; the median price charged by providers was about $36K for a helicopter transport &amp; $40K for a fixed-wing transport.,2019-06-26 15:50:00,Twitter for iPhone,2,2

Here are a few of the ways this legislation will lower health care costs.,2019-06-26 15:49:58,Twitter for iPhone,2,1
Ben Ippolito: “If enacted this legislation would lower insurance premiums and drug prices for consumers and would ensure patients are no longer exposed to surprise medical bills. By lowering costs this bill would also improve access to health care.”,2019-06-26 15:49:58,Twitter for iPhone,1,0
At our hearing on this legislation last week Ben Ippolito an economics and health fellow at the @AEI said: “Together the provisions in this bill would meaningfully increase competition and transparency in health care markets.”,2019-06-26 15:49:57,Twitter for iPhone,1,0
Over the last two years our committee has held 16 hearings on a wide range of topics related to reducing the cost of health care – specifically how do we reduce what the American people pay out of their own pockets for health care.,2019-06-26 15:49:57,Twitter for iPhone,3,1
And last July the HELP Committee heard from Dr. Brent James from the @theNASEM who testified that up to half of what the American people spend on health care may be unnecessary.,2019-06-26 15:49:57,Twitter for iPhone,2,0
A recent @Gallup poll found that the cost of health care was the biggest financial problem facing American families.,2019-06-26 15:49:57,Twitter for iPhone,2,0
Altogether this legislation will help to lower the cost of health care which has become a tax on family budgets and on businesses on federal and state governments.,2019-06-26 15:49:56,Twitter for iPhone,2,0
Another bill from @ChuckGrassley and @SenatorLeahy and many others the CREATES Act will help bring more lower cost generic drugs to patients by eliminating anti-competitive practices by brand drug makers.,2019-06-26 15:49:56,Twitter for iPhone,2,2

I hear about high cost of prescription drugs. I hear from doctors about administrative burden. And I hear about how the place where medical procedures are performed can make health care more expensive.,2019-04-04 17:19:02,Twitter Web Client,3,4

It’s important to know that the cost of health care has in effect become a tax on the budgets of families employers the federal government and state governments.,2019-04-04 17:19:01,Twitter Web Client,1,4
That's why I’m working w/Sens @PattyMurray @ChuckGrassley &amp; @RonWyden to develop specific bipartisan steps to help deal w/the startling fact that up to 1/2 of what Americans spend on health care services may be unnecessary according to Dr. Brent James of the National Academies.,2019-04-04 17:19:01,Twitter Web Client,1,2

If some Republicans can rise above partisanship on Article I to vote against the declaration of emergency it is my hope that some of my Democratic friends will agree to do that this week and help us avoid what I've described as a truly miserable choice.,2019-04-02 00:37:11,Twitter for iPhone,1,14
I know it can be a difficult vote for Democrats but I earnestly hope that we won't be presented with a truly miserable choice of either continuing to debase the advice and consent role of the Senate or using the Harry Reid precedent to change the Senate rules by majority vote.,2019-04-02 00:37:11,Twitter for iPhone,1,8

According to @HHSGov spending less time on these administrative tasks will improve efficiency and therefore could save $3.3 billion a year. And because doctors can see patients’ full medical history they can avoid ordering unnecessary tests and procedures.,2019-03-26 14:38:06,Twitter Web Client,2,3
The rules will reduce administrative burden on doctors so they can spend more time with patients. A recent study from @kpthrive found that emergency room doctors in order to use electronic health records systems make up to 4000 mouse clicks per shift.,2019-03-26 14:38:06,Twitter Web Client,2,1

Former Gov @BillHaslam called it the “single biggest impediment to more students enrolling in Tennessee Promise.”   Today Congress is ready to take the final step of simplifying the #FAFSA to make it easier for 400000 Tennessee students to attend college. #MakingCollegeWorthIt https://t.co/yTaGdRIBh8,2019-03-13 17:03:00,Twitter Media Studio,46,199

It is hard to imagine Blount County without Dean Stone and that’s why I’m glad @POTUS signed into law a bill @MarshaBlackburn and I introduced to name a bridge on the Foothills Parkway as the Dean Stone Bridge. https://t.co/6M9I7YgoRM,2019-03-13 00:35:02,Hootsuite Inc.,1,4
After 5 years of bipartisan work the #FAFSA is simpler &amp; on mobile devices.

Bipartisan discussions have produced a lot of agreement on simplifying the number of questions so the purpose of this hearing is to learn what we need to know before taking the final step.,2019-03-12 14:18:18,Twitter Web Client,3,3
7) There is a $6 billion advantage to taxpayers – that is the amount the Department of Education estimates is issued in improper payments every year.,2019-03-12 14:18:18,Twitter Web Client,4,3
5) Families can now apply for federal student aid sooner because they can use information from their last year’s tax return. 6) Students can find out as early as eighth grade how much Pell grant funding they may be eligible for.,2019-03-12 14:18:18,Twitter Web Client,3,3
3) Simplifying the form and the verification process should encourage more students to apply for federal aid which will ensure that eligible students receive the Pell they deserve. 4) Students can now complete the #FAFSA on their iPhone.,2019-03-12 14:18:17,Twitter Web Client,3,5
2) Dramatically decrease the number of students selected for verification because students’ tax data would automatically transfer to the Department of Education which would greatly reduce the need for verification.,2019-03-12 14:18:17,Twitter Web Client,6,16
Here is what all of these improvements mean to the 20 million families that fill out the #FAFSA every year: 1) Reduce the 108 questions to 15-25.,2019-03-12 14:18:17,Twitter Web Client,10,21
The final step should be our bipartisan solution that will reduce the number of questions on the #FAFSA from 108 to 15-25 questions.,2019-03-12 14:18:16,Twitter Web Client,4,6
Third last year the Senate passed legislation Senator Murray and I introduced that allows students to answer up to 22 questions on the #FAFSA with just one click and will stop requiring students to give the same information to the federal government twice.,2019-03-12 14:18:16,Twitter Web Client,3,5
Second the Trump Administration has put the #FAFSA application on a phone app. I was at Sevier County High School in November and saw students zipping through the FAFSA on their iPhones.,2019-03-12 14:18:16,Twitter Web Client,6,21
First the Obama Administration allowed families to fill out the #FAFSA using their tax information from the previous year so they could apply to school in the fall rather than having to wait until spring.,2019-03-12 14:18:15,Twitter Web Client,3,4
Five years ago at a hearing before this Committee we heard that the vast majority of questions on the #FAFSA are unnecessary. I asked if the four witnesses could each write a letter to the Committee recommending how they would simplify the FAFSA.,2019-03-12 14:18:15,Twitter Web Client,3,2
This will help 400000 families in Tennessee 350000 families in Senator @PattyMurray’s Washington State and millions more for each of us who have it in our hands to finish our work on simplifying the #FAFSA.,2019-03-12 14:18:15,Twitter Web Client,4,4
After five years of work we are ready to do just that by reducing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid – the #FAFSA – from 108 questions to two dozen and eliminate the need for families to give their financial information to the federal government twice.,2019-03-12 14:18:14,Twitter Web Client,8,25

Today I am interested in hearing more about specific recommendations to improve access to affordable primary care.,2019-02-05 15:21:30,Twitter Web Client,5,17
And employers are increasingly taking an active role in their employees’ health and in the cost of health care like employing a doctor on-site so employees don’t have to take time off of work to see a primary care doctor.,2019-02-05 15:21:30,Twitter Web Client,3,11
There are other ways to lower health care costs through expanded access to primary care. Another is community health centers which we talked about at our last hearing and that are where 27 million Americans go for their primary care.,2019-02-05 15:21:29,Twitter Web Client,5,8
And while the data may be incomprehensible today it is a ripe opportunity for innovation from private companies to arrange the data so primary care doctors can help their patients can have better outcomes and better experiences at lower costs.,2019-02-05 15:21:29,Twitter Web Client,4,7
I believe we can empower primary care doctors nurse practitioners and physicians assistants to go even a step further. At our 4th hearing we heard about how patients have no idea how much a particular treatment or test will end up costing.,2019-02-05 15:21:29,Twitter Web Client,4,4
Dr. Adam Boehler who leads the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation recently told me that primary care is only 3-7 percent of health care spending but affects as much as half of all health care spending.,2019-02-05 15:21:28,Twitter Web Client,5,5

This year I have met with Ranking Democrat Senator @PattyMurray and nine other committee members to discuss compiling these ideas into a single piece of legislation.,2019-02-04 19:41:56,Twitter Web Client,2,12
During the last four years the Senate education committee has held 27 hearings on the Higher Education Act.  These hearings have resulted in a number of bipartisan proposals that make college more affordable and worth students’ time and money.,2019-02-04 19:41:27,Twitter Web Client,1,6
Third I am proposing a new accountability system based upon whether borrowers are actually repaying their student loans. This should lower tuition for some programs or even discourage schools from offering programs that are not worth it to students.,2019-02-04 19:40:55,Twitter Web Client,5,16
This plan makes sure if there was no money earned there would be no money owed and that would not reflect negatively on a borrower’s credit. The other option would be a 10-year payment plan with equal monthly payments similar to a 10-year mortgage.,2019-02-04 19:40:32,Twitter Web Client,2,16
The option I believe most borrowers would choose is a repayment plan based on a borrower’s income which would never require the borrower to make payments of more than ten percent of his or her discretionary income.,2019-02-04 19:40:09,Twitter Web Client,3,20
Second a new way to repay student loans: We should scrap the current system of nine different ways to repay federal student loans. It should be replaced with two options both of which would automatically deduct payments from your paycheck.,2019-02-04 19:39:44,Twitter Web Client,2,12
First simplify the #FAFSA: We can cut the dreaded Free Application for Federal Student Aid from 108 questions to no more than two dozen.,2019-02-04 19:39:22,Twitter Web Client,6,17
Today I have three proposals to help make the answer to all four of those questions YES.,2019-02-04 19:38:58,Twitter Web Client,2,11

The questions I hear most often about college are: Can I afford it? Is it worth it? And can you make applying for financial aid and repaying student loans simpler?,2019-02-04 19:37:20,Twitter Web Client,5,10
The U.S. has most of the best colleges in the world but also the most graduates paying off college debt. Roughly 40 million borrowers owe $1.5 trillion in collective student loan debt.,2019-02-04 19:36:51,Twitter Web Client,5,14

TUNE IN about 5:15 PM ET – I’ll be speaking on the Senate floor about longtime @knoxnews cartoonist Charlie Daniel. Since 1958 his cartoons were the first thing I looked for in the Knoxville newspapers. Watch live here: https://t.co/sFPQQOg7mh,2019-01-29 19:41:09,Twitter for iPhone,2,4
Two weeks ago Senator @PattyMurray and I took the first step by introducing legislation that will extend funding for community health centers for five years at $4 billion a year in mandatory funding.,2019-01-29 15:22:15,Twitter Web Client,2,10
In Fiscal Year 2019 these centers received $4 billion in mandatory funding and $1.6 billion in discretionary funding. Congress has to act by the end of September to make sure community health centers continue to receive this federal funding and keep their doors open.,2019-01-29 15:22:15,Twitter Web Client,2,6
Community health centers have also been an important part of combating the opioid crisis that has impacted virtually every community across the country. #OpioidCrisisResponse,2019-01-29 15:22:15,Twitter Web Client,2,5
There are about 1400 federally-funded health centers that provide outpatient care to approximately 27 million people including 400000 Tennesseans at about 12000 sites across the United States.,2019-01-29 15:22:14,Twitter Web Client,2,4
Because the Lewis Health Center @MauryRegional is a community health center they charge patients based on a sliding scale which means more people have access to and can afford health care close to home.,2019-01-29 15:22:14,Twitter Web Client,2,6
The old hospital building was turned into the Lewis Health Center @MauryRegional a community health center which operates as something between a clinic and full hospital. Lewis Health Center estimates they can deal with about 90 percent of patients that walk in the door.,2019-01-29 15:22:14,Twitter Web Client,2,8
For example in Tennessee after Lewis County’s only hospital closed the closest emergency room for its 12000 residents was 30 minutes away.,2019-01-29 15:22:13,Twitter Web Client,3,6
Community health centers actually fit into a larger topic of great interest to this committee – primary care. Today we are talking about the community health centers where 27 million Americans receive their primary care and other services.,2019-01-29 15:22:13,Twitter Web Client,2,5
Today’s topic is extending federal funding for community health centers as well as four other federal health programs which are all set to expire at the end of September.,2019-01-29 15:22:13,Twitter Web Client,2,4
I will be working on these priorities with Ranking Member @PattyMurray with members of the HELP Committee and other senators interested reaching a result on lowering health care costs and updating the Higher Education Act.,2019-01-29 15:22:12,Twitter Web Client,1,4
This is the first hearing of the new Congress so let me take a few minutes to talk about what we hope to accomplishment these next two years. Number one reducing health care costs. And number two making sure a college degree is worth students’ time and money.,2019-01-29 15:22:12,Twitter Web Client,2,4

The U.S. has no greater friend in the Middle East than Israel and it is in our national security interest to ensure the country has adequate protections amid growing tensions in the region posed by Iran and the ongoing conflict in Syria.,2019-01-29 00:45:16,Twitter for iPhone,3,26

I emphasized to him my strong support of the 2012 #MercuryRule requiring power plants to install pollution control equipment to reduce emissions of mercury &amp; hazardous air pollutants to keep air waters &amp; streams clean &amp; my strong desire to keep the rule in place w/o any changes,2019-01-28 23:11:49,Twitter Web Client,2,14

He understands that the attorney general’s job is to represent the United States of America and be the people’s lawyer and not the president’ lawyer. He will be an excellent Attorney General. I hope he is swiftly confirmed again.,2019-01-28 20:38:43,Twitter Web Client,2,18

This is a very reasonable request for a comprehensive border security plan by @POTUS.   It's now time for Democrats to be reasonable and do what they've done for 20 years—working with four other presidents https://t.co/kPCVl0Usvq,2019-01-28 14:25:00,Twitter Media Studio,193,594
.@POTUS is asking for about 234 more miles of physical barrier as part of a comprehensive plan. That would not build a wall from shining sea to shining sea. As he said it would simply do what we did under Presidents Obama W. Bush Clinton and H.W. Bush https://t.co/HJcMJiUZa5,2019-01-28 00:24:00,Twitter Media Studio,49,121
For 20 years members of Congress have known that a comprehensive border security plan includes more personnel more technology and more physical barrier.   It’s time for Congress to reach a result on comprehensive border security. https://t.co/WwvtU7vywk,2019-01-27 21:23:00,Twitter Media Studio,21,54

Congress worked with Presidents Obama W. Bush Clinton and H.W. Bush to build 654 miles of physical barriers.   Speaker Pelosi and President Trump should step back to allow Congress to reach a result on a comprehensive border security plan. https://t.co/xalCBRcTzo,2019-01-27 18:15:30,Twitter Media Studio,24,75

Charlie’s cartoons have been the first thing I have looked for in the Knoxville newspapers since 1958 when I graduated from Maryville High. Over the years he’s skewered me as much as anybody. It’s going to be harder to start each day in good humor without a touch of Charlie. https://t.co/0KayIeuqHo,2019-01-25 17:53:34,Twitter Web Client,10,55
I voted twice today to open the government because it should never have been shut down. I voted for @POTUS‘s proposal to build 234 miles of additional wall along our 1954 mile southern border.   https://t.co/n3FY6x8Qt8,2019-01-25 01:10:04,Hootsuite Inc.,12,95
Today the Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said to @TSA employees @CBP agents and the tens-of-thousands of other loyal hardworking federal employees that he objects on behalf of the Democratic Party to paying them while they're being forced to work without being paid. https://t.co/G9nOw9nWUS,2019-01-25 00:31:00,Twitter Media Studio,39,56
Tennesseans elected me to make government work not to shut it down.   I will continue working to re-open the government and get federal employees back to work as quickly as possible.    https://t.co/n3FY6x8Qt8,2019-01-25 00:10:06,Hootsuite Inc.,17,135

.@POTUS has offered a reasonable compromise which opens the government and includes relief for “dreamers” disaster relief and additional funding for improved border security; Democrats are still playing politics.   https://t.co/n3FY6x8Qt8,2019-01-24 23:09:51,Twitter Web Client,17,52
Democrats approved 654 miles of wall on the southern border for the last four presidents – Presidents Obama George W. Bush Clinton and George H.W. Bush.   Why is it suddenly “immoral” to build more wall when Trump is @POTUS?,2019-01-24 22:46:49,Twitter Web Client,137,299
I am glad @POTUS re-nominated Tennessean Cliff Corker to serve as U.S. District Judge for the Eastern District of TN. Judge Corker is a well-qualified nominee &amp; will serve our state with distinction. I hope the Senate will quickly consider &amp; confirm him. https://t.co/UxlKZffQr6,2019-01-24 21:15:10,Twitter for iPhone,2,12
