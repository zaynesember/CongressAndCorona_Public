Wyoming is blessed to have such strong representation in the U.S. House. @RepLizCheney has quickly risen to third in House leadership. I can see a future where she could be Speaker &amp; @SenJohnBarrasso Majority Leader.,2020-01-16 19:57:37,Twitter Web App,18,97
Today the Senate passed historic bipartisan trade legislation – USMCA – that will provide certainty to Wyo industries &amp; ensure we can maintain beneficial trade relationships with Mexico and Canada.

In 2018 Wyoming produced about $270 million exports to Canada and Mexico. For many industries like agriculture machinery and minerals this deal would help create and maintain quality jobs in the state while fostering new innovation and fairer trade across the board.,2020-01-07 18:04:42,Twitter Web App,61,204

Currently for-profit colleges are not allowed to receive more than 90% of their revenue from federally funded student aid.

For example it includes a non-defense provision that will provide all federal employees with 12 weeks of paid parental leave. This is a new benefit that costs more than $8 billion and it passed without debate by inclusion in this defense bill.,2019-12-17 22:29:26,Twitter Web App,6,8
Our nation is on an unsustainable fiscal course. We simply cannot continue down this path. While the NDAA is well-intentioned with many proposals I support it ignores our overspending problem &amp; furthers the practice of passing legislation while ignoring the rules of the Senate. https://t.co/jokYrqOo02,2019-12-17 22:28:02,Twitter Media Studio,12,16

When an animal is categorized as an endangered species  states &amp; communities are most impacted but they can’t verify dispute or complement the info. WY has some of the richest wildlife habitat in the world - we should encourage an open process that uses the best data available.,2019-02-14 19:49:18,Twitter Web App,2,8
Introduced legislation w/ @SenatorRisch and @SenPatRoberts that would require the federal government to disclose the data it uses for Endangered Species Act listings. https://t.co/ycZ04H3nuF,2019-02-14 19:49:17,Twitter Web App,7,14
If you travel w/ a bow for hunting you shouldn't have to worry that a shortcut through a nat'l park could find you in legal jeopardy.

Closing an IRS office at any time creates problems for taxpayers in Wyoming. But it is particularly burdensome when it occurs during the filing season – and the first one after our comprehensive tax reform – when folks continue to learn how to comply with new tax changes.,2019-02-11 20:00:52,Twitter Web App,2,2
I’m troubled by the recent closure of the IRS taxpayer assistance center in Cheyenne. I sent a letter requesting it be reopened as quickly as possible. https://t.co/b0q9y8Omb8,2019-02-11 20:00:52,Twitter Web App,3,1
I cosponsored @SenatorMenendez’s legislation to reauthorize programs that promote autism spectrum disorder research education &amp; supports. It’s important to improve understanding of causes and symptoms and find solutions to improve lives of those affected. https://t.co/E028CKGE0d,2019-02-08 18:59:23,Twitter Web App,6,18
It would provide new opportunities for American businesses farmers and ranchers. We need to open dialogue and the exchange of ideas and commerce that would help move Cuba forward. It is time to work toward positive change. https://t.co/pbCUMEBcPW,2019-02-08 17:06:18,Twitter Web App,8,16
History has shown that the Cuba trade embargo has not been very effective. I reintroduced legislation w/ @SenAmyKlobuchar and @SenatorLeahy to lift the embargo. This bipartisan legislation would benefit the people in America and in Cuba.,2019-02-08 17:06:18,Twitter Web App,35,49
It’s not bad to point out disagreements but for those of us in a good position to get something done I think we should focus on the parts of what @realdonaldtrump said where we can agree. My full #SOTU statement here: https://t.co/KS8EdBXGaz,2019-02-06 04:21:46,Twitter Web Client,6,11
Tonight’s State of the Union address was about choices. People will have to choose on what they want to focus. Some will focus on conflict. https://t.co/M4N0zUChxA,2019-02-06 04:21:45,Twitter Web Client,21,107

The decision to adopt or foster a child isn’t always an easy decision but it is one of the most loving choices a family can make. That is why it is so important that adoptive and foster parents have access to the provider of their choice.,2019-01-30 22:25:54,Twitter Web App,7,9
I introduced legislation today w/ @MikeKellyPA that would ensure that faith-based institutions and individuals can continue to provide child welfare services for those who need them. https://t.co/GCRTCMxkUd,2019-01-30 22:25:53,Twitter Web App,10,18
I held a Senate @BudgetGOP Hearing today on the Congressional Budget Office’s report which highlights the need for Congress to confront the threat of the nation’s out of control spending. https://t.co/kJLR9Lb0cp,2019-01-29 22:19:38,Twitter Web App,6,10
Something has to change. Lurching from deal to deal under the threat of a government shutdown only leads to more spending more deficits &amp; ultimately more debt. Congress must implement foundational and structural policy changes if we are ever to achieve fiscal sustainability. https://t.co/6WavCUltPs,2019-01-29 22:18:30,Twitter Media Studio,9,32
Borrowers of private student loans already receive this information but borrowers of loans issued by the Department of Education do not. This bill would provide more transparency so families can be better informed about their financing options.,2019-01-28 21:28:16,Twitter Web App,5,11
I introduced legislation today with @RepJohnCurtis that would force the government to be upfront about the true cost of federal student loans used by students and families. https://t.co/a5H5N52QFw,2019-01-28 21:28:16,Twitter Web App,7,23

I cosponsored @SenJohnBarrasso's ONSHORE Act which would make it easier for states to manage oil &amp; gas permitting &amp; regulatory responsibilities on federal land. Empowering states can help create more jobs more local revenue &amp; keep energy prices low. https://t.co/NGeKOZ2HtU,2019-01-24 22:36:00,Twitter Web App,7,22
