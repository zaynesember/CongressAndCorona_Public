.@POTUS’ words are beyond insulting and demeaning to the friends and family members of those who have actually experienced this form of racist terrorism. White supremacy is a scourge—instead of belittling it we must come together to fight it.,2019-10-22 17:16:31,Twitter Web App,19,56
Lynchings are violent racist acts by white supremacists. Impeachment is a lawful constitutional process used to hold elected officials accountable. There are no words for how deeply wrong it is for the president to compare congressional oversight to a lynching.,2019-10-22 17:16:30,Twitter Web App,47,188
The nature crisis has reached a tipping point. The U.S. is losing a football field’s worth of natural areas every 30 seconds. We need to pass the #ThirtyByThirty resolution to save nature and confront this crisis head on.,2019-10-22 15:27:47,Twitter Web App,8,22

We’ve seen that @POTUS is willing to raid critical military funds to build his wall— including the $125 mil he’s taken from military projects in NM.

When the Trump administration rolled back the Methane Waste Prevention rule they essentially took $ out of the people's pockets &amp; gave it to polluters.

Today we honor the 100th anniversary of the 19th amendment—when women at long last secured the right to vote.

.@POTUS and his unhinged policy agenda are quite simply a disaster for border states like New Mexico. Trump’s border tax could devastate our economy—punishing border communities for a humanitarian crisis that this administration has only made worse. Senseless and likely illegal. https://t.co/MHqskzBsAB,2019-05-31 14:08:10,Twitter for iPhone,108,222
And we need to address the root factors that are causing so many families to flee their homes and come to our borders. I’ve introduced legislation to do that—and will keep working toward immigration solutions that keep our communities safe and match our values as a nation.,2019-05-31 00:02:02,Twitter Web Client,11,64
I also met with asylum seekers—mostly families fleeing violence in Central America and seeking a safer life for their children. Their stories were heart wrenching.

And this isn’t just about putting resources into the census. We have to make sure it’s a census that treats every person fairly. Which is why we cannot have a useless “citizenship question” scaring away immigrant communities.,2019-05-29 01:30:19,Twitter for iPhone,3,38
Even a one percent undercount could mean hundreds of millions of dollars lost for New Mexico communities.   The Census counts big for New Mexico. We need to ensure a fair count for our state.,2019-05-29 00:18:54,Twitter for iPhone,6,28
Census numbers determine how federal $ is distributed. When communities are undercounted they receive fewer resources.  We must make sure all underrepresented communities are counted: rural and tribal areas colonias immigrants non-English &amp; limited-English speakers children.,2019-05-29 00:18:54,Twitter for iPhone,7,28

I pressed @SecBernhardt about #MMIW resources this week.  Because domestic violence &amp; public safety resources we currently provide on reservations can be summed up in one word: pathetic.

We knew @POTUS was violating the law to raid military funding and divert it to his border wall.

To achieve #JusticeForNativeWomen we need to pass #VAWA2019 now. Native women should not have to wait any longer for protections they need—and they cannot afford to have #VAWA languish in @SenateMajLdr’s legislative graveyard.,2019-05-23 19:01:48,Twitter Web Client,22,55
There are 5000+ known cases of missing Native women.   55% of Native women have experienced domestic violence.   56% of Native women have been sexually assaulted.    These numbers are abhorrent. We need to address the #MMIW crisis.,2019-05-23 19:01:47,Twitter Web Client,90,148
#VAWA drastically improved response to gender-based violence. But it it desperately needs updates as women of color continue to face disproportionate rates of abuse.

The Trump Administration ignores science but certainly doesn’t ignore the high powered lobbyists from the polluting industries. That’s why I’m proud to stand up against that kind of destruction along with @Wilderness my colleagues and so many others.,2019-05-14 22:45:35,Twitter Web Client,29,98

This area is at real and continued risk. Over the last three years the Bureau of Land Management has proposed new oil and gas leasing inside a buffer area around the park that had been protected.

Chaco has been a #UNESCO World Heritage site since 1987 only one of 23 such sites in our nation.

Chaco is known around the world as the heart of the Chacoan people a culture that inhabited the Four Corners area for hundreds of years.

A lot has changed since 1872. But our mining laws haven’t— and it’s costing everyday Americans big bucks while mining companies reap the profits.

This isn’t limited to Trump's @EPA.  Their @Interior nominee is hiding pesticide studies that showed just how toxic #cpf is. 1200 species at risk of extinction.

The Trump @EPA is happy to sit around &amp; ignore the fact that #chlorpyrifos is a toxic pesticide that damages the brains of children and causes serious health problems for exposed farmworkers.

The admin. now wants to build 46 miles of Trump’s border wall south of Deming NM–one of the quietest spots on the border where the majority of those arriving are seeking asylum.

Today I’m introducing bipartisan legislation with @RandPaul to end the war in Afghanistan. Congress needs to exert its authority to bring our brave troops home after a job well done. A never-ending war is not in our national interests.,2019-03-05 15:20:15,Twitter Web Client,102,440
The Senate must pass our resolution to terminate the president's national emergency declaration.

Mr. Miller has a history of advocating against Tribal interests. He is going to preside over a jurisdiction that has 427 Tribal nations.

Eric Miller's nomination came to the floor after a 30-minute hearing which took place with no Democrats present during a recess week.

It's the 10th anniversary of the Lilly Ledbetter #FairPay Act— an important step but we still have a lot of work to do. After all in New Mexico women make 84 cents for every $1 a man makes &amp; the numbers are even lower for women of color. #Ledbetter10,2019-01-30 22:21:49,Twitter Web Client,11,55
Great to see @GovMLG standing up for a cleaner future— and for New Mexicans’ way of life. Climate change is already hurting NM and if the federal gov’t isn’t going to take action states communities and businesses need to step up. https://t.co/87zqODzb80,2019-01-30 22:05:39,Twitter Web Client,46,169
Glad we got @EPA to change course &amp; keep safeguards in place to protect farmworkers—including children—from pesticides. There's NO reason to weaken such rules. That’s why I fought for a bipartisan pesticide bill to protect them. Congress should pass it. https://t.co/lsF31E5ipt,2019-01-30 21:41:33,Twitter Web Client,14,38
#HR1 makes sure billionaires can’t buy our elections anymore. If that worries @senatemajldr maybe the bill isn’t the problem. https://t.co/WrkVpXR3ew,2019-01-30 18:46:06,Twitter Web Client,285,691
In the first @IndianCommittee hearing of the 116th Congress we got right to work approving several bills including the PROGRESS Act &amp; SURVIVE Act. These will improve self-governance &amp; public safety— two of Indian Country’s long term legislative priorities. https://t.co/Z4iK2Y8SeJ,2019-01-30 17:05:59,Twitter Web Client,9,32
Proud to reintroduce #SavannasAct this Congress. This bipartisan legislation seeks justice for Native women who go missing &amp; experience violence at alarming rates— crimes that often go uninvestigated.  We must pass this bill as a first step towards ending the violence. #MMIW,2019-01-29 22:19:53,Twitter Web Client,54,136
The #TrumpShutdown cost our country $11 billion— yes billion. And $3 billion of that is gone forever. That's on top of the pain he caused so many hardworking families which can't be counted in dollars. We can't allow @POTUS to do this ever again. https://t.co/qUOjUSxYP6,2019-01-29 19:44:43,Twitter for iPhone,46,122
While communities across the U.S. rush to prep for a dangerous cold front POTUS makes jokes about this potential disaster online.  We know climate change contributes to extreme weather events. But sadly the facts just don't matter to this president. https://t.co/WKqrtSnbja,2019-01-29 17:39:26,Twitter Web Client,29,88
It’s a historic day as @HouseJudiciary begins hearings on #HR1 a bill that will end corruption and put the power of our democracy right back where it belongs: in the hands of the people.

Now that the shutdown is over we need to make sure federal employees in #NM and across the country get their missed paychecks without delay.    We wrote #OPM’s @Weichert45 to stand up for these workers. They need to know when they're getting paid. And they need to be paid ASAP. https://t.co/oSviLDDF0T,2019-01-28 21:54:31,Twitter Web Client,20,43

Now that there is a path to re-opening the government the president must face up to reality drop his outrageous and wasteful wall demands and support common-sense border security proposals so we can keep the government open long-term.,2019-01-25 20:05:55,Twitter Web Client,21,122
It shouldn’t have taken 35 days and a month of missed paychecks to end the #TrumpShutdown. In fact this attempt at governance-by-extortion never should have happened.  Now we need to ensure every person hurt by the shutdown— in NM and across the country— is made whole.,2019-01-25 20:05:54,Twitter Web Client,49,211
Numbers don’t lie: people would rather have an open government than a wall. So why is the #TrumpShutdown still going on?   @senatemajldr do right by the American people. Work with us and open up the government. https://t.co/hEhG2KZKQ8,2019-01-25 17:52:19,Twitter Web Client,44,123
Native communities didn’t ask for a #TrumpShutdown. But as is often the case they're among those hurt most. We must open the gov't now &amp; restore essential services not only because it’s the right thing to do— failing to goes against the core of our trust &amp; treaty obligations.,2019-01-25 17:41:39,Twitter Web Client,9,42
With @IHSgov &amp; @USIndianAffairs shut down Native communities are losing essential health &amp; safety services.

On my way to the Senate floor where I'll vote to end the #TrumpShutdown with no conditions attached.   Let's re-open the government stop holding innocent people hostage and then work to resolve our differences on border security &amp; immigration. It's as simple as that.,2019-01-24 19:36:38,Twitter Web Client,152,899
The #TrumpShutdown is taking public safety hostage too.  As @afa_cwa says: "we cannot even calculate the level of risk currently at play nor predict the point at which the entire [air travel] system will break.”  @SenateGOP: we need to end the shutdown right away. Work with us. https://t.co/3lTdQ2OU3q,2019-01-24 19:22:10,Twitter Web Client,25,39

The Polluter Pays principle is fundamental to environmental law. This lack of enforcement is alarming.  And now @EPA is shut down but the polluters aren’t. @EPAAWheeler must answer for what this means for our air and water and ultimately our future.,2019-01-24 17:05:21,Twitter Web Client,26,51
Time after time the Trump @EPA puts polluters’ wallets over clean air and water for the American people.   By failing to penalize polluters they've once again shown a complete disregard both for their mission and for public health. https://t.co/IUopEuqJwU,2019-01-24 17:05:20,Twitter Web Client,34,52
Honored to speak to the #NMLeg yesterday. As I said in my address we are one state. We all have a stake in the prosperity of our communities. We all have a stake in the success of our children’s future.

This shutdown never should have happened in the first place—and it certainly shouldn't still be going on. The American people are hurting and they can't afford to wait as @POTUS and @senatemajldr continue to stand in the way of a resolution.

We're in the the longest government shutdown in American history. Families across New Mexico and the country are suffering.    But we didn't get here by accident. At every step of the way @POTUS and @senatemajldr have blocked sensible efforts to re-open the gov't.    A timeline:,2019-01-23 20:45:46,Twitter Web Client,84,224

The details of @POTUS' proposal show that it is even worse than it first looked.  Not only does it waste billions in taxpayer money on an ineffective wall but it also includes poison pill anti-immigrant changes to current law--while not providing meaningful relief for Dreamers. https://t.co/EN6AfZpcew,2019-01-23 02:36:19,Twitter for iPhone,114,258
So @SenateMajLdr please—let’s end the shutdown that never should have happened and then we can work in good faith on smart border security. This is untenable &amp; it’s actively hurting hardworking Americans. It’s just wrong. End the #TrumpShutdown,2019-01-22 22:41:46,Twitter for iPhone,56,159
We need to take a step back from the politics and look at the real human impact of this shutdown.

We must do all that we can – as representatives of the people – to strengthen the foundations of our democracy. To carefully tend to this garden. And to fulfill the bold promise our state and our country hold. #UdallNMLeg,2019-01-22 19:20:18,Twitter Web Client,7,20
We are one state. We all have a stake in our communities' prosperity. We all have a stake in our children’s future.  When we work together we accomplish so much more than when we isolate ourselves within the walls of our own party. #UdallNMLeg,2019-01-22 19:19:37,Twitter Web Client,6,18
I hear from thousands of New Mexicans as I travel around the state. And they all want the same things – a livable wage. Accessible health care. A stronger state &amp; brighter future for our children.   Even when we disagree we are all committed to these same goals. #UdallNMLeg,2019-01-22 19:19:12,Twitter Web Client,3,8
New Mexico’s four military bases all serve critical national security missions. And we have made sure those missions continue — I am committed to the expansion and success of our bases. #UdallNMLeg,2019-01-22 19:18:04,Twitter Web Client,2,3
Our national laboratories &amp; military bases keep our nation secure. They're a cornerstone of our economy &amp; workforce. Los Alamos &amp; Sandia are at record funding levels. And we want to make sure clean up at LANL goes forward. #UdallNMLeg,2019-01-22 19:17:40,Twitter Web Client,2,4
New Mexicans want and deserve quality health care but not enough have it. Just as we have worked to defend the #ACA we need to fight challenges in our health system.   And we must fight the opioid epidemic ravaging NM. We need to end the scourge of opioid addiction. #UdallNMLeg,2019-01-22 19:16:58,Twitter Web Client,2,5
As we work to vitalize our rural economy we must think big. I am committed to closing the digital divide in rural NM &amp; across the nation. That’s why I have worked on grants and legislation to secure rural and tribal broadband. #UdallNMLeg,2019-01-22 19:15:31,Twitter Web Client,2,6
Acequias and land grants are so important to New Mexico. But they face red tape trying to access @USDA programs. We passed legislation to makes them directly eligible for assistance and funding. And we re-started the flow of funds to the Army Corps acequia program. #UdallNMLeg,2019-01-22 19:14:47,Twitter Web Client,3,7
As a senior member on @SenateApprops I have a chance fight for funding that benefits our state.   One of my priorities is our rural economy. I've worked on legislation to increase resources for farmers &amp; ranchers who are just getting started or looking to expand. #UdallNMLeg,2019-01-22 19:13:21,Twitter Web Client,2,6
In all I try &amp; accomplish for Indian Country three principles guide me: respect for tribes’ &amp; pueblos’ sovereignty promotion of self-determination &amp; federal government's obligation to engage in meaningful consultation whenever federal actions affect Indian Country. #UdallNMLeg,2019-01-22 19:11:39,Twitter Web Client,7,17

The scientific consensus is clear. @IPCC_CH warns we have only 12 years to meet this challenge head on or we can’t reverse course.  And on that note: we must protect public lands. They're essential to our identity and economy— public lands belong in public hands. #UdallNMLeg,2019-01-22 19:10:08,Twitter Web Client,5,10
NM feels climate change and we need to fight drought and modernize water infrastructure. We can't meet 21st century challenges with 19th century infrastructure— so I've worked to nearly double the funding to rural water projects. #UdallNMLeg,2019-01-22 19:06:23,Twitter Web Client,6,14
I support immigration reform. Dreamers &amp; their families should be able to stay in our state &amp; communities. Families must be reunited. Inhumane immigration policies must end. New Mexico is a border state. I am making sure we are all heard in these debates. #UdallNMLeg,2019-01-22 19:05:45,Twitter Web Client,8,18
When the gov’t is open we can debate &amp; negotiate in good faith. I support strong border security. But I want to see cost-effective &amp; locally appropriate measures. Not the president’s wall that won’t work costs billions &amp; would stand as a symbol of division. #UdallNMLeg,2019-01-22 19:05:16,Twitter Web Client,8,16
The terrible gov’t shutdown impacts more than 10000 NM federal employees  and many contractors in our state. This shutdown is affecting real people with real mortgages real bills to pay and real families to feed.     The cruelty of this shutdown must stop.  #UdallNMLeg,2019-01-22 19:04:31,Twitter Web Client,11,17
I’ve been working for years on comprehensive reform for our democracy. My #ForThePeople Act will rein in our campaign finance system end gerrymandering &amp; set a high ethical bar for gov't officials.  These measures are not red or blue.  They are red white and blue. #UdallNMLeg,2019-01-22 19:02:54,Twitter Web Client,9,16
Democracy depends on all citizens voting. Democracy depends on elected officials carrying out the people's will. Democracy depends on gov't officials working for the people not their wallets.  My #ForThePeople reform package will help return democracy to the people. #UdallNMLeg,2019-01-22 19:01:03,Twitter Web Client,7,11
Polls shows the people want affordable healthcare good jobs gun safety laws measures to combat climate change &amp; humane immigration laws.  Yet many in Congress &amp; the Executive only seem to hear the 1%.
