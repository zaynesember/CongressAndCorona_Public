Seen those TV ads urging Minnesotans to call my office? Turns out they’re funded by big private equity firms who make money from people who get surprise medical bills despite having insurance.

Here is what I think: the Mueller report painstakingly shows how Russia attacked our democracy to benefit the Trump campaign.   Rather than reporting this attack to the FBI this help was welcomed at the highest levels by Trump's team.,2019-07-24 12:35:45,Twitter Web App,19,70

Women ðŸ‘ deserve ðŸ‘ equal ðŸ‘ pay ðŸ‘ for ðŸ‘ equal ðŸ‘Â work. The #LillyLedbetterFairPayAct signed into law 10 year ago today was a key step in fighting the #incomegap but thereâ€™s more work we must do to close the gapâ€”particularly for women of color. I'm ready to get to work.,2019-01-29 21:48:17,Twitter Web Client,24,246
@SenatorBaldwin Something Minnesota and Wisconsin can agree on: federal contractors have bills to pay just like everyone else and deserve their paychecks.,2019-01-29 21:32:51,Twitter Web Client,3,5
@ChrisMurphyCT Thanks for being a strong champion for workers Chris. This is an important issue of economic fairness dignity and justice.,2019-01-29 21:31:18,Twitter Web Client,3,23
Working hard to get Rs on my bill to secure federal contract workers back pay. Many recognize the importance of this issue &amp; some have sent letters urging action. Fighting for fairness justice &amp; the well-being of 1000s of Americans should be bipartisan. https://t.co/fwsxS0xSRY,2019-01-29 21:19:36,Twitter Web Client,38,113
A coalition of more than a dozen dems and @32BJSEIU are joining me @RepPressley and @EleanorNorton to secure #BackPayNOW for federal contract workers hurt by Trumpâ€™s shutdown. Too often these folks are invisibleâ€”we're standing up for them. Watch LIVE: https://t.co/7xNUDFZFs9 https://t.co/efNTVlV2u7,2019-01-29 19:29:37,Twitter Web Client,24,58
Minnesota: this record-breaking cold snap is something to take seriously. With wind chill it looks like temps may drop as low as -50F. Please bundle up be careful when driving and stay warm. https://t.co/lx50zbCYRj,2019-01-29 16:33:14,Twitter Web Client,16,55

TOMORROW: @RepPressley @EleanorNorton @32BJSEIU other Senate &amp; House colleagues &amp; I are gathering together to call for #BackPayNOW. Itâ€™s completely outrageous that 1000s of federal contractors arenâ€™t getting back pay after the shutdown. I have a bill to right that wrong.,2019-01-29 0:14:19,Twitter for iPhone,62,215
Hurricane Maria rocked Puerto Rico leaving it w/o electricity for months. But the island has overcome great obstacles to rebuild itself &amp; I'm glad to see @UMNews working w/ PR to explore more resilient energy sources that may better withstand hurricanes. https://t.co/tFKAEIDsn7,2019-01-28 20:48:40,Twitter Web Client,8,25
Native communities were some of the hardest hit by Trumpâ€™s shutdown jeopardizing the health and wellness of Native people. I helped introduce a bill to protect critical tribal services like health care and law enforcement from future budget uncertainty. https://t.co/ifEYYaScJc,2019-01-28 19:09:21,Twitter Web Client,44,134
Wish this said â€œall membersâ€â€”but instead weâ€™re just stuck with â€œsome.â€ Working to fix that. Everyone should be on-board with securing back pay for federal contract workers who arenâ€™t receiving back pay post shutdown. #FairnessForContractors https://t.co/YsfhARv4ss,2019-01-28 17:45:40,Twitter Web Client,6,33
On #HolocaustRemembranceDay #WeRemember the millions of lives lost to genocide.

@TonyaJoRiley Good question Tonya. Yeah @senatemajldrâ€”are you and the Republicans going to support getting these workers their back pay? Asking for thousands of people.,2019-01-25 21:59:46,Twitter for iPhone,13,79
Totally agree. I introduced a bill to right this wrong in the Senate and @RepPressley has a bill over on your side of the Capitol. Letâ€™s right this wrong. Workers need their paychecks. https://t.co/ZjQVZFRS7s,2019-01-25 21:37:44,Twitter for iPhone,386,1546
It's unfair. Contractors incl. cafeteria workers security guards &amp; janitors. They help the government run &amp; deserve back pay like everyone else. I introâ€™d a bill to fix this. 27 Senate Dems support &amp; it has a House companion. Would be nice if @senatemajldr put it on the floor. https://t.co/dStSxsjKo4,2019-01-25 20:12:18,Twitter for iPhone,157,419
I joined @HardballChris to talk abt the shutdown which needs to end. Today marks the 2nd missed paycheck for fed employees. Families canâ€™t put food on the table or pay bills. Planes areÂ delayedÂ because of staffing issues. We're at a tipping point Mr. President. #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/RLeOV1uTbT,2019-01-25 16:39:57,Twitter Media Studio,14,65
Annie a Duluth resident landed her dream job working as aÂ chemist at the @EPA but sheâ€™s had to file for unemployment bc of the shutdown.Â Fed workers &amp; fed contract workers like Annie do important work. We must open the government so they can get back to work &amp; get paid.,2019-01-25 15:18:55,Twitter Web Client,17,99
About to sit down with @HardballChris to discuss the latest shutdown news and my bill to secure back pay for federal contract workers. These Americansâ€”janitors cafeteria staff security guardsâ€”arenâ€™t getting paid and havenâ€™t received back pay after past shutdowns. Tune in.,2019-01-25 0:05:05,Twitter for iPhone,17,86
Met w/ Mpls Mayor @Jacob_Frey &amp; St. Paulâ€™s @MayorCarter_. We covered the shutdown &amp; also discussed affordable housingâ€”something I want to work on on the Senate Banking Cmte. When MNs have affordable &amp; stable homes it's easier to land jobs do well in school &amp; live healthy lives. https://t.co/SZBw7ht7b1,2019-01-24 23:33:18,Twitter Web Client,21,170
Hey @MN_Chamber thank you for calling for an end to Trumpâ€™s shutdown. Itâ€™s a complete waste of taxpayer dollars and I've heard from Minnesotans about how itâ€™s hurting their businesses. We need to open the government ASAP. Minnesotans are counting on it. https://t.co/VGdVp9jZ0R,2019-01-24 19:30:57,Twitter Web Client,10,65

Trumpâ€™s shutdown may have lasting damage to education in Minnesota. The shutdown is costing the University of Minnesota about $500K A DAY to make up for the lack of federal funding disrupting important research. #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/isndBhUhAe,2019-01-23 21:01:03,Twitter Web Client,40,85
Federal contract employees are too often invisible. And get thisâ€”theyâ€™re not getting paid and havenâ€™t received back pay after previous shutdowns. We ought to make sure these folks can be made whole. So Iâ€™ve introduced a bill to do just that. To me it's just a matter of fairness. https://t.co/4mA2654UQF,2019-01-23 20:30:58,Twitter Web Client,20,52

Trumpâ€™s shutdown is costing the University of Minnesota about half a million dollars a day. As time goes on &amp; the U runs out of funds thereâ€™s going to beÂ moreÂ gaps in research &amp; gaps in opportunities for students. Another reason why we must end this shutdown as soon as possible. https://t.co/ou6CUPGMyZ,2019-01-23 1:42:55,Twitter Media Studio,86,285

46 years ago today the #RoeVsWade #SCOTUS decision affirmed womenâ€™s freedom &amp; power to live the lives they want to lead &amp; make decisions for themselves.

Looks like #DACA will remain in place for most of 2019 but the urgency to solve this crisis remainsâ€”#SCOTUS declined to take up the case for now but could later. Congress needs to pass the DREAM Act. https://t.co/TOyFJI885d,2019-01-22 18:56:57,Twitter Web Client,11,25
