I don’t work for Big Pharma. I work for the people of MN. And that’s why I support the FLAT Prices Act which will hold Rx drug companies accountable for the prices they set and keep more money where it belongs - in YOUR pockets.,2019-02-13 03:19:58,Twitter Web App,73,551
There are thousands of federal contract workers who have yet to receive back pay from the shutdown. Will you join me in raising your voice to make sure the Senate acts to right this wrong? We have until Friday. https://t.co/9OuD6vxNeu,2019-02-13 01:11:45,Twitter Media Studio,189,514
As I travel across MN people gathered in living rooms auditoriums and community centers ask why vital Rx medications have to cost someone their life savings.   The answer is: They don’t.  It’s why I’m fighting to help people get the life-saving meds they need at a lower cost.,2019-02-11 21:17:11,Twitter Web App,37,267
A quick selfie of @Tim_Walz @peggyflanagan and me celebrating @amyklobuchar yesterday. With a couple thousand other friends! https://t.co/p7AAtkwRqx,2019-02-11 14:45:47,Twitter Web App,32,378
Across MN people know that @amyklobuchar shows up she listens and then she delivers for people because she knows that’s her job. That is her North Star. I’m proud to be with her today as she launches her presidential campaign from the heart!  #Klobuchar2020 https://t.co/bT8CFoRDE4,2019-02-10 22:30:32,Twitter for iPhone,74,664
I’ve known @amyklobuchar for decades. As a friend a colleague a fighter. Despite gridlock &amp; grandstanding Amy finds a way to fight through politics of division to get things done for people.

THOUSANDS of federal contract workers are still waiting to receive the pay they deserve from the shutdown. It’s time for that to change. https://t.co/nzBkcyOeoc,2019-02-08 23:00:44,Twitter Web App,42,114

Let me be clear @realdonaldtrump: No one needs you or any other politician to tell them what they can or cannot do with their body. And I’ll keep fighting until everyone’s right to choose is protected. #SOTU,2019-02-06 03:31:08,Twitter Web App,362,2627
Low-wage federal contractors didn’t get paid during the 35-day government shutdown. And after past shutdowns they haven’t received back pay they deserve. Let’s do the right thing &amp; make sure folks get paid. https://t.co/nzBkcyOeoc,2019-02-05 18:03:54,Twitter Web App,29,141

Guaranteeing back pay for thousands of low-wage federal contractors is something we have to do together. Thanks to the first Republican co-sponsor of this bill. https://t.co/heWxott1QK,2019-02-05 03:23:46,Twitter Web App,24,133

When the government shuts down Native communities are some of the hardest hit. I’ve helped to introduce legislation to make sure tribal nations - in MN &amp; across the country - don’t have to worry about future gaps in funding due to government shutdowns. https://t.co/z6nx5TB1Xy,2019-01-30 20:03:34,Twitter Web App,18,88

The government is open but - as of now - low-wage federal contractors aren’t receiving back pay. I’ve introduced a bill to fix that.👇 https://t.co/8NDJYGvLlf,2019-01-29 19:18:27,Twitter Web App,140,384
That’s right. I’ve teamed up with @brianschatz @sherrodbrown and many more on a bill to make sure low-wage federal contractors get the back pay they deserve but have never received after previous shutdowns. https://t.co/A2ry9KJkcq,2019-01-26 22:05:56,Twitter for iPhone,207,1128

The #TransMilitaryBan is clear and disgraceful discrimination. There is no reason - absolutely no logical reason - for the Trump Admin to kick out transgender service members who are honorably serving our nation. This must be stopped.
