If President Trump is looking to turn the impeachment trial into a reality TV show he chose the right team with Alan Dershowitz Ken Starr and Robert Ray. But this is the U.S. Senate not the People's Court.   The pressure is on Senate Republicans to ensure this trial is fair. https://t.co/5xt0yVQAvd,2020-01-17 22:45:43,Twitter Media Studio,34,112

The WH briefing on Soleimani's assassination offered no evidence that there was an “imminent attack”.

Let’s be clear: new sanctions on Iran are a provocation. Escalation isn’t just military action. Doubling down on this failed policy moves us away from negotiations and inflicts suffering on ordinary Iranians that leads the leadership to take provocative action. It needs to stop. https://t.co/K8uVilyx3k,2020-01-10 17:21:52,Twitter Web App,21,63

The consequences of climate change will be dire if we do not take action.   A tenfold increase in ice-free summers in the Arctic. 99% loss of coral reefs. A doubling of species loss.

The White House budget proposal due today but delayed by Trump’s shutdown likely will cut critical international funding. Doing so shows Trump is willing to give up U.S. global leadership in areas where it matters most especially Asia.,2019-02-04 17:29:43,Twitter Web Client,49,95
The GOAT plain and simple. Cue the Duck Boats! Here’s one for the history books. Congratulations @Patriots. #GoPats #GOAT,2019-02-04 04:08:22,Twitter for iPhone,51,304
For the sake of his constituents and plain decency Governor Northam should resign. Defiance in the face of near universal agreement is either ignorance or arrogance. Both are intolerable.,2019-02-03 21:33:57,Twitter for iPhone,25,170

The #Rohingya are not the only people suffering at the hands of Burmese officials. Through repressive laws the Burmese government is punishing journalists activists and ordinary citizens.

~10.5 mil North Koreans (41% of the pop.) are undernourished. Our goal should be to change the behavior of the regime not punish ordinary people.

President Trump and his war cabinet have yet again decided that America should go it alone this time by paving the way for a dangerous arms race with costly new weapons.

Congrats @marty_walsh for spurring this big move for Boston. Boston is now ready to step up to the plate on climate action.

Working women deserve #EqualPay for equal work but they are robbed by gender discrimination every time they receive a paycheck.

Thanks @MichaelEMann for joining today’s Sen. Climate Change Task Force. You framed it well: we aim to limit global warming to 1.5ºC but remember this limit “is not a cliff it’s a minefield.” If we go over we still have to forge on - with ever more deadly risk beneath our feet. https://t.co/XH2e1Jvfd8,2019-01-29 20:02:38,Twitter for iPhone,59,177

In about as long as it takes him to launch a tweet President Trump could order America’s armed forces to launch an unprovoked nuclear first strike. That cannot be allowed to happen. https://t.co/EYaHovlrFS,2019-01-29 16:49:59,Twitter Web Client,170,458
Right now for any reason or for no reason at all Donald Trump could launch a nuclear first strike and no one could stop him.

This #TrumpShutdown will go down as not just the longest in U.S. history but as the most unnecessary and pointlessly cruel.

Outrageous. Michelle an air traffic controller from Foxborough Mass. was forced to work due to the #TrumpShutdown and after working 80+ hours received a $7.78 paycheck. That’s 10 cents an hour.
