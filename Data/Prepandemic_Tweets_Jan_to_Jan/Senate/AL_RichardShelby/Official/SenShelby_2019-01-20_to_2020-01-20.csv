POTUS’s proposal would reopen govt by funding remaining 25% including resources for border security &amp; disaster aid. It’s a compromise in that it also includes immigration reforms that Dems have long supported. I urge my colleagues to support it for the good of the American ppl.,2019-01-20 20:26:08,Twitter for iPhone,68,178
