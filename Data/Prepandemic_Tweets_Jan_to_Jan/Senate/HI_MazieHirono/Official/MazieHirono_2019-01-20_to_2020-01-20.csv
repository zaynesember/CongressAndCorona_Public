There's a clear lack of humanity in how Customs and Border Protection treats immigrants crossing the border. We must change the culture and train CBP to give asylum seekers esp. children the care they need and treat them as humans seeking a better life. https://t.co/fK8wWzBJWt,2019-03-06 17:12:30,Twitter Media Studio,516,1733
When Kevin McAleenan comes before the Judiciary Committee today we'll question him on what happened at CBP when two children died in their custody and what steps are being made to ensure this doesn’t happen again. https://t.co/UXKghdxh5x,2019-03-06 14:44:36,Twitter Media Studio,472,1731
Today is #AAPIEqualPay Day – the day when AAPI women’s pay catches up to what their white male colleagues earned in 2018. It takes over two extra months to earn what they earn in just a year. It’s time we close that gap and pass the Paycheck Fairness Act now.,2019-03-06 01:55:06,Twitter for iPhone,216,861
Judicial nominees like Chad Readler promise they'll set aside their ideology and follow precedent when they get their lifetime appointments. We know that's not the case.

.@realDonaldTrump has called me crazy once again for supporting the #GreenNewDeal. His incoherent criticism is on par with other climate change deniers who also seem scared silly to face the facts of climate change.,2019-03-03 00:50:53,Twitter Web Client,2867,13259
Republicans hurt women. Now they're condemning women who  face the agonizing decision of needing a late term abortion. Compassion and understanding are called for in this situation - it is not the time for the heavy hand of government to reach into our wombs. #HowDareYou,2019-03-01 23:35:50,TweetDeck,4499,16398
The hard truth is that the Republican Party hurts women. They demonize them for their medical needs cut off crucial health care and they create loopholes to allow businesses to exclude coverage. To make sure these efforts stick they pack the courts. https://t.co/Lno1ikqojP,2019-02-28 23:15:56,Twitter Media Studio,5649,15006

Let me be clear: infanticide is already illegal. This bill continues Republicans' ceaseless efforts to push a false narrative to achieve their goals of shaming women criminalizing doctors and ending a woman's right to a safe legal abortion. https://t.co/JHgMCFK1F4,2019-02-28 14:07:25,TweetDeck,6885,20409
Andrew Wheeler is the perfect example of a cabinet appointment in the Trump era – conflicted unethical and hostile to the mission of the agency he was nominated to lead.

Conservative politicians should not be telling doctors how they should care for their patients. Instead women - in consultation with their families and doctors - are best positioned to determine their best course of care.  https://t.co/ri2xLqJrE0,2019-02-25 22:08:35,Twitter Media Studio,3228,11566
