This is unbelievable. Here Galloway lead auditor discusses CHANGING &amp; manipulating the audit to make it more critical of my office or me. This violates basic auditing standards ethics rules and possibly state law. Calls for independent investigation #moleg https://t.co/MCprwbPtxg,2020-01-15 16:19:27,Twitter for iPad,103,241
What is going on here? Is the Auditor’s office independent or is it just a giant political campaign? Is it legal to change conclusions of a state audit for political gain? Read for yourself https://t.co/UFgjsEYaIZ,2020-01-14 23:44:47,Twitter for iPad,168,482

Galloway also took $$ from McCaskill herself during this audit to help Galloway run for Governor,2020-01-14 23:44:46,Twitter for iPad,88,340
These Dem allegations were heavily promoted by McCaskill campaign manager back in 2018. But during this audit Galloway HIRED that campaign manager - as state employee. On her payroll. Senior staff. He’s still there collecting paycheck,2020-01-14 23:44:46,Twitter for iPad,106,392
But some pretty serious things have come to light. #1 the lead auditor on Galloway’s review openly discussed changing audit’s conclusion in order to make it more critical of me after she found no evidence of misconduct. That’s shocking unethical and perhaps illegal,2020-01-14 23:44:46,Twitter for iPad,137,463

Remember all those Democrat attacks back during 2018 Senate campaign? Dems filed 10+ sep lawsuits/complaints against me to influence election. All failed.

Born &amp; raised there. Played sports in school... https://t.co/iaT3w6yjOi,2019-08-22 19:27:02,Twitter for iPhone,27,173
He worries about the decline of small towns like Clarkton &amp; Malden. But he’s very proud of the Clarkton school system. And he’s a powerful advocate for other vets people in his church who need help you name it. He gets things done. “My momma didn’t raise a fool” he says,2019-08-22 17:14:15,Twitter for iPhone,33,218
Don is from Clarkton MO which is nearby Malden. He tells me right off that he was one of 12 kids growing up and his mom raised them right.

He &amp; his wife raised a family of their own https://t.co/WtQ348ydPB,2019-08-22 17:14:15,Twitter for iPhone,53,299

This is Ray who I met at Nick’s place. Ray graduated from Malden played sports was a good athlete but is struggling to make it now. He’s got three young kids he’s supporting &amp; he wants to do right by them. He says good work is hard to come by https://t.co/ywkqCSD3P0,2019-08-22 17:09:10,Twitter for iPhone,30,117

They fall into alcohol drugs. For young black men especially their job prospects in the area are poor w/ so many jobs moving out or overseas. And they don’t feel heard. Nick doesn’t live in Malden any longer but he keeps his shop open as a service to the community,2019-08-22 17:07:13,Twitter for iPhone,15,65

This is Nick. He owns New Growth barbershop on Main in Malden. Nick gave me a lot of his time this morning &amp; he’s an amazing man. He grew up in Malden graduated there. He made some mistakes &amp; served some time. When he got out he couldn’t get a job. So he started his own shop https://t.co/02lC6abX0X,2019-08-22 17:07:10,Twitter for iPhone,48,172
He loves the people he lives with and serves.

The Bible says “God is love” and Mark lives it https://t.co/ZjA1idgTq7,2019-08-22 16:55:13,Twitter for iPhone,12,86
He’s frank about the challenges Malden faces. He says jobs are scarce &amp; drugs are a big problem &amp; too many kids don’t have enough to eat and don’t have any prospects.

Daniel is the fourth generation of his family to farm this land and he hopes he won’t be the last. He &amp; his wife have three small kids and he tells me they depend on his wife’s income to make it.

There are many in Washington who want me to do as I am told &amp; go along to get along. That’s not going to happen. I’m not here to make nice with Washington. I’m here to represent the people of Missouri &amp; their values and I will not be deterred. Here’s my statement on Neomi Rao: https://t.co/phND4oLw0e,2019-02-28 17:34:09,Twitter for iPhone,244,941
News flash for the DC Establishment: I’m not going to stop asking judicial nominees whether they will follow the Constitution. It’s my job. https://t.co/rrTDRU88x9,2019-02-27 13:55:52,Twitter for iPhone,235,663
In its rush to smear @WSJopinion can’t even state the law correctly. Embarrassing for them and for whomever fed them this smear https://t.co/VCqiwz5dbW,2019-02-26 13:43:24,Twitter for iPhone,108,320
The implied fundamental rights cases are where the courts just make stuff up. I’m opposed to that. And I will ask every judicial nominee whether she or he is too,2019-02-26 02:39:39,Twitter for iPhone,134,535
I love being attacked by the WSJ for asking whether judicial nominees will adhere to the Constitution. But at least try to get law right. McDonald &amp; Timbs are INCORPORATION cases. Roe Casey etc are implied fundamental rights cases. Very different things. https://t.co/Of5Z7LS5Xt,2019-02-26 02:34:41,Twitter for iPhone,247,942

I just voted NO on the border spending bill. Doesn’t secure the border weakens ICE. It’s 1100+ pages and was filed in the dead of night. Only in Washington is this considered normal. This is a stupid way to do business and it’s time to change it,2019-02-14 21:51:52,Twitter for iPhone,4935,21090

.@AbigailShrier nails the Democrats’ shocking turn to anti-semitism: “Actively working to isolate Israel and accusing pro-Israel Jews of bribing Congress isn’t ‘insensitive.’ It’s something far darker and more malevolent.” It’s hate pure &amp; simple. https://t.co/O3B4BndSxE via @WSJ,2019-02-14 02:21:52,Twitter for iPhone,149,299

Here’s to a year where @Facebook starts being more transparent about what it actually does with our personal data about how social media preys on our psychology and about the need for an open honest discussion on Section 230,2019-02-04 14:38:18,Twitter for iPhone,22,65

VA Governor Ralph Northam says infants w “deformities” may be candidates for abortion - AFTER birth. “The infant would be delivered the infant would be kept comfortable ... and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.” That’s called infanticide,2019-01-30 22:07:29,Twitter for iPhone,1635,4260
All the many Democrats running for President should be asked immediately if they support the radical Virginia and New York laws allowing abortions during birth,2019-01-30 21:50:36,Twitter for iPhone,166,484
If this isn’t shocking in 21st century America I don’t know what is. This politician wants to allow infants to be killed once they have been born. In America. The Senate should vote to stop this today. Protect all unborn infants after 5 months https://t.co/CMNSkyMxnX,2019-01-30 21:47:58,Twitter for iPhone,222,623
Wait a minute. Facebook PAID teenagers to install a surveillance device on their phones without telling them it gave Facebook power to spy on them? Some kids as young as 13. Are you serious? https://t.co/87MGCk5BeM,2019-01-30 14:27:34,Twitter for iPhone,101,172
