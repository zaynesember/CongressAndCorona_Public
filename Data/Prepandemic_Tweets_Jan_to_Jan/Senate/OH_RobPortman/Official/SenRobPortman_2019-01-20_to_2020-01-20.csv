This bipartisan legislation is vital to our efforts to keep fentanyl out of our communities &amp; I urge my colleagues to join me in passing the #FIGHTFentanyl Act.,2019-10-24 21:29:37,Twitter Web App,4,6
Fentanyl has hit #Ohio communities particularly hard. This deadly synthetic drug knows no zip code &amp; is devastating individuals &amp; families across the US. Today @Sen_JoeManchin &amp;  I introduced the bipartisan #FIGHTFentanyl Act to permanently schedule fentanyl-related substances.,2019-10-24 21:29:37,Twitter Web App,13,19
We must make it clear that overproducing steel as #China has done is unacceptable. Overcapacity hurts #Ohio &amp; American steel workers and it’s important we create a level playing field for trade. https://t.co/H6ej2qTAqv,2019-10-24 20:16:56,Twitter Web App,7,12
Ahead of the Global Steel Forum @SenSherrodBrown @SenatorBraun @SenBobCasey &amp; I sent a letter to @USTradeRep urging the admin to prioritize steel overcapacity.

This morning I am chairing a bipartisan Permanent Subcmte on Investigations hearing with federal agencies about how best to improve online comment process &amp; ensure Americans have a voice in rulemaking process. Watch live here: https://t.co/viLOmCIx5I,2019-10-24 14:12:24,Twitter Web App,2,7
I’m hopeful that this bipartisan report will start a discussion between Congress &amp; the federal agencies about how we can make online comment systems work better both for government agencies and the American people. https://t.co/UghH7K1TDd,2019-10-24 14:12:24,Twitter Web App,1,5
However the online comment systems are too often being abused &amp; agencies have not taken adequate steps to address that misuse. Victims of identity theft are being misrepresented on federal govt websites &amp; agencies are doing little to protect them.,2019-10-24 14:12:24,Twitter Web App,1,4

King opened the Portsmouth Spartan Kettlebell Club in an effort to give those struggling with opioid addiction a community they could turn to and work on their recovery &amp; wellness.

Combined the 9 agencies that received letters employ about half of the federal workforce meaning that the actual cost to American taxpayers of the recent government shutdowns is likely much higher due to a greater amount of back pay and additional associated costs.,2019-09-20 17:16:01,Twitter Web App,1,5
