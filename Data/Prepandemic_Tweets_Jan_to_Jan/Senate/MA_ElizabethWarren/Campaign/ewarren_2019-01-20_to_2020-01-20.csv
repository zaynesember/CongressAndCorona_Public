Republicans and the Trump administration are hoping that the Supreme Court will back their extreme plans to limit access to abortion and birth control—which is why I've got a plan to protect both no matter what the Supreme Court does. Enough is enough. https://t.co/X8mqEpP66j,2020-01-19 22:24:50,Twitter Web App,865,3206
Amazon made over $10 billion in profits but paid $0 in federal income taxes in 2018. That won’t happen when I'm president. Use this calculator to find out how much big corporations would pay when they pay their fair share. https://t.co/90rDIRy6wc,2020-01-19 21:13:08,Twitter Web App,1548,4948
The Trump administration wants to weaken the law that bars American companies from bribing foreign officials. That’s corruption plain and simple. I have a plan to reform our global financial system—and fight corruption at home and abroad. https://t.co/wSVyvQBvw8 https://t.co/F25ONUuXNv,2020-01-19 20:39:08,Twitter Web App,1327,4153
It’s hard to be a small business owner especially when you have to pay much more in taxes than companies like Amazon.  My administration will fight the influence of corporate money to make our government work for the people—not giant corporations. https://t.co/QdmqpIfwJK,2020-01-19 18:36:18,Twitter Media Studio,795,2932
And we do that by investing in Black Americans and creating opportunity. The fights for social racial and economic justice belong to all of us—and when I’m president that truth will inform our policies and our actions.,2020-01-19 16:19:10,Twitter Web App,283,1980
For generations the federal government has prevented African Americans from building wealth and financial security.

Black Wall Street was defined by the human spirit. So the community was rebuilt relatively quickly peaking in the 1940s. But it declined in the sixties and seventies because of gentrification and failure to have a systematic mentorship process in place.,2020-01-19 16:19:09,Twitter Web App,183,1142

The men responsible for killing hundreds of innocent African Americans committed an act of domestic terrorism but they were never held accountable. The search for the victims’ mass graves continues to this day as does the domestic terrorism threat of white nationalism.,2020-01-19 16:19:08,Twitter Web App,247,1396
While we can never undo this hateful act of domestic terrorism or the pain and suffering it inflicted on the Black community we all must do our part to dismantle the legacy of systemic racism and oppression that was left in its wake—and that starts with justice and opportunity.,2020-01-19 16:19:08,Twitter Web App,238,1601

Nearly 100 years ago mobs of white residents descended on Black Wall Street in Tulsa Oklahoma ransacking Black businesses and murdering hundreds of African Americans.
