I’ve spent years fighting side-by-side with our fearless @MassAGO Maura Healey to help MA students scammed by Corinthian Colleges. And we're going to stay in this fight until @BetsyDeVosED &amp; @usedgov follow the law &amp; cancel every last Corinthian student’s loans. https://t.co/4FkNs2iW6u,2019-10-22 23:49:55,Twitter for iPhone,342,1914
I’m concerned that big banks are using short-term lending market volatility to pressure regulators to weaken the financial rules that protect our economy. @StevenMnuchin1 should explain why the govt needed to step in for the 1st time since the 2008 crisis. https://t.co/GE8bbAF50h,2019-10-22 20:32:29,Twitter Web App,418,1624
My bill to #StopWallStreetLooting would hold private equity firms responsible for their companies – including in the health industry. And Congress should pass #MedicareForAll so nobody goes broke paying a medical bill that pads the pockets of insurance execs &amp; Wall St bankers.,2019-10-21 17:31:33,Twitter Web App,141,792
Almost 2/3 of US hospitals outsource physician staffing many to companies owned by private equity firms. @RepMarkPocan @RepLloydDoggett &amp; I want to know more about the role those firms play in the sharp rise in surprise out-of-network medical bills.,2019-10-21 17:31:32,Twitter Web App,158,843
Nobody having a heart attack or stroke picks their ambulance or ER doc. But when a hospital outsources its physician staffing or ambulance services to a private-equity-owned company patients can get stuck with outrageous medical bills. It's obscene. https://t.co/erxknVm9sw,2019-10-21 17:31:32,Twitter Web App,1304,6439
Sec. @BetsyDeVosED has given a free pass to every swindler &amp; crook trying to make a buck off America’s students &amp; teachers.

I’ll give you one guess who’s responsible for obstructing student debt relief for teachers &amp; other public servants. (Hint: it’s the Secretary of Education who doesn’t believe in public education.) https://t.co/KH0UBu1nFY,2019-10-20 14:25:25,Twitter Web App,567,2467
But most borrowers never got the help. Last month @USGAO reported @usedgov is STILL rejecting 99% of Temporary Expanded PSLF applications. The Trump admin has only spent 3.8% of the emergency funding Congress set aside to help public service borrowers. https://t.co/ssFYyVS0Cy,2019-10-20 14:25:24,Twitter Web App,59,211
I’ve been fighting to fix the PSLF problem from the moment I heard about it – &amp; I led the expansion of PSLF funding by $700 million over 2 years to forgive the student loan balances of people caught in this mess &amp; enrolled in the wrong program. https://t.co/slRcfRQGzZ,2019-10-20 14:25:24,Twitter Web App,43,218
Starting in 2007 our country made a promise to public servants: pay your student loans for 10 years &amp; the balance would be wiped out. But as the 10-year point hit people who thought they were enrolled in PSLF discovered they weren’t. It’s a nightmare. https://t.co/bjJzLY63NV,2019-10-20 14:25:24,Twitter Web App,68,220
Secretary @BetsyDeVosED &amp; the Trump admin wrecked the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program for teachers &amp; other public servants. @usedgov needs to explain why borrowers aren’t getting the help Congress made available &amp; how they're planning to fix this. https://t.co/KKb20Ga3PA,2019-10-20 14:25:23,Twitter Web App,892,3395

@Navient @usedgov New evidence from a @CFPB lawsuit shows @Navient officials knew it was scamming students &amp; didn't stop it. @SenBlumenthal &amp; I told @BetsyDeVosED &amp; @usedgov they have no excuse: they can't throw more taxpayer money at Navient &amp; renew their $200M contract. https://t.co/nf9wwdrb50,2019-10-19 15:02:40,Twitter Web App,363,1540

Workers from Sears Toys “R” Us &amp; Shopko have had to fight tooth &amp; nail for their pay severance &amp; pensions.

Housing costs are a real obstacle to families in MA &amp; across the country &amp; we can’t fix it by nibbling at the edges.

David Bernhardt has spent his career working to pollute our environment for corporate profits. He’s on the side of Big Oil Big Coal and Big Ag – not the American people or public lands.

That’s not all. A lawsuit alleges that Bernhardt’s ex oil and gas clients “began receiving sudden and dramatic windfalls only months since his swearing-in” as Deputy at @Interior.

I’m glad Tim Sloan got canned but let’s be clear: if he broke the law he should go to jail like anyone else.

I kept pushing the Fed to maintain the growth cap on @WellsFargo until Tim Sloan was gone. @SenSherrodBrown and I told the @CFPB and @USOCC to use their power to fire him.

But @WellsFargo kept getting caught cheating – on mortgages car loans money laundering and loans to service-members (just to name a few).

That growth cap gave the Fed leverage to force @WellsFargo to reform – because investors don’t like companies that can't grow. Later I told Fed Chairman Powell to hold a public vote of the Fed Board before lifting the cap and he agreed. https://t.co/Jeetsw4xlv,2019-03-28 22:45:31,Twitter Web Client,102,418
I also pushed Janet Yellen to take more aggressive action. She listened.

Tim Sloan was part of @WellsFargo’s senior leadership during the fake accounts scam – which he got rich off of and tried to cover up. I told him to his face he should have been fired.
