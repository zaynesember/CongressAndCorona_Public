Trump again undermining Puerto Rico’s recovery by not releasing the full $20 billion in HUD disaster recovery funding.

Republicans say they need more evidence but they support Trump blocking documents &amp; witnesses. They cannot have it both ways.,2020-01-16 22:32:08,Twitter Web App,130,465

What documents show not just what witnesses say is critical insight to help uncover the truth. Trump has concealed every single document sought or subpoenaed. What is he hiding? The Senate must get the docs. https://t.co/CZgZSuBf8p,2020-01-15 15:25:10,Twitter for iPhone,153,529

A group of bipartisan colleagues&amp;I saw the writing on the wall&amp;knew Trump might decide to abandon our strategic partners in Syria w/o a plan for protection.

On this #TaxDay the first under the #GOPTaxScam the rich continue to reap massive benefits while fewer Americans will receive a tax refund—resulting in many Fortune 500 companies paying less in taxes than hardworking Americans. https://t.co/wgR6DX5CjP,2019-04-15 21:07:38,Twitter Web Client,403,659
The number of disruptive harassing robocalls people receive is out of control. I've introduced the ROBOCOP Act to help cut down on this vicious onslaught of scam &amp; spam messages by requiring phone companies provide robocall blocking tech &amp; verify caller IDs are accurate. https://t.co/A2ZSHZ0VJk,2019-04-15 19:10:01,Twitter for iPhone,255,1043
While protecting passengers airlines canceling 737 MAX flights till August should also demand independent safety scrutiny. Airlines bear real risks &amp; legal responsibility without unquestionably independent airworthiness approval of all 737 MAX systems. https://t.co/h9DIPkumrJ,2019-04-14 20:05:00,Twitter for iPhone,105,318

While 2x as many companies will be paying almost nothing thanks to Trump’s tax cut many Americans will be getting a tax bill instead of a refund. Wall Street doesn’t need a tax cut the people of CT do. https://t.co/BvIZ447uGi,2019-04-13 20:19:31,Twitter for iPhone,411,1015
Thousands of @StopandShop workers &amp; their families' health care is at risk as the company raises costs &amp; limits coverage.

.@AMBCPSC must work with Fisher-Price to streamline recall requirements &amp; insist on a full refund for all affected to ensure these deadly products are removed from homes. I continue to call on @USCPSC to investigate whether infant inclined sleepers are fundamentally unsafe.,2019-04-12 22:46:58,Twitter for iPhone,26,71
Glad @USCPSC heeded our call on the Rock ‘n Play but the recall doesn’t include the Kids II sleepers &amp; puts lots of burdens including a complicated disassembly on already sleep-deprived parents or caregivers. https://t.co/yDEUo1mgaG https://t.co/9bz72DzVJK,2019-04-12 22:46:57,Twitter for iPhone,27,72

Months after colleagues &amp; I wrote to top chains calling on them to remove tobacco products @riteaid takes a step to curb the epidemic of teen e-cig usage. Still more action is needed to completely eliminate tobacco products from these stores’ shelves. https://t.co/mnIa0EkSuT,2019-04-12 20:13:50,Twitter Web Client,29,113
The Fisher-Price's Rock ‘n Play &amp; other infant inclined sleep products must be recalled immediately. After @ConsumerReports links at least 36 infant deaths to these common baby products CPSC must take swift action to get these products off the shelves. https://t.co/JBleCHt10i,2019-04-12 18:44:14,Twitter Web Client,43,73
Corrupting the nation’s immigration system by using asylum seeking women &amp; children as pawns to retaliate against political foes is a new low for this grotesquely cruel &amp; inhumane White House. https://t.co/u0CJcItVaU,2019-04-12 16:46:24,Twitter Web Client,589,1588
A great example of teamwork. Thanks to @CTNationalGuard &amp; @USCGNortheast for your steadfast dedication to keeping our waterways safe. https://t.co/H1lNMJmFg6,2019-04-12 13:25:52,Twitter for iPhone,15,79

Jaw-dropping. So-called “pro-life” Texas legislators were willing to punish women with the death penalty for having an abortion. These lawmakers clearly have zero respect for women their reproductive health or their lives. https://t.co/gK6PDgk8HZ,2019-04-11 22:03:31,Twitter Web Client,1888,4321
#TBT I was proud to join @CTCADV this week to call on the Senate to pass #VAWA19.

As Acting Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt has continued this Admin’s relentless attack on our public lands our precious natural resources the air we breathe &amp; the water we drink. We can’t trust Bernhardt to put the public’s interest first.,2019-04-11 19:22:27,Twitter Web Client,336,883
Treasury Secretary Mnuchin’s refusal to turn over Trump’s taxes is unprecedented &amp; unlawful. The President is not above the law &amp; Congress should be granted the documents needed to provide proper oversight. https://t.co/AWrXRghslO,2019-04-11 16:08:38,Twitter Web Client,4147,9157
Passengers &amp; airline crews should be confident that the cabin air they breathe during flights is free from any toxic fumes. The Cabin Air Safety Act requires FAA &amp; aircraft manufacturers stop ignoring unsafe air quality levels &amp; mandate reporting training &amp; monitoring tech. https://t.co/Q3uuEtYtx4,2019-04-11 14:34:00,Twitter Web Client,93,272
