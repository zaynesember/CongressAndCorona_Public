Awesome to see @sncGOP teaming up with @BCWIGOP for this event.  We took a deep dive on the complexity of immigration reform. Drielle Hucek’s story of becoming a U.S citizen and her appreciation for the uniqueness of America was inspiring. https://t.co/6ibFCi8G4q,2019-10-20 17:59:56,Twitter for iPhone,3,9

Check out this new ad from @judgehagedorn. We need another justice on the state Supreme Court who will apply the law as written not alter it. https://t.co/l48ocFInTW,2019-03-21 00:35:07,Hootsuite Inc.,4,4
April 2 is coming up fast. @judgehagedorn will keep politics out of the courtroom and uphold the rule of law. The stakes are high — make sure you get out and vote. https://t.co/BtDSczYiwZ,2019-03-20 18:26:54,Hootsuite Inc.,5,6

(2/2) Understanding the risk of Democrat socialistic tendencies should provide motivation to re-elect Republicans up and down the ballot in November 2020. #wiright,2019-03-11 17:26:25,Hootsuite Inc.,2,7
I’m glad #Milwaukee will enjoy the economic boost from hosting #DNC2020. As voters in a key battleground state WI will get a first-hand look at Democrats’ extreme policies that would reverse the economic progress made under the Trump administration.
