The #GreenNewDeal would cost every household up to $65300 per year. The total price tag would be $93 trillion over 10 years. That is roughly four times the value of all Fortune 500 companies combined. https://t.co/lGJvzB1bc7,2019-02-25 15:49:51,Twitter Web Client,80,136
The @AAF's analysis shows that the #GreenNewDeal would bankrupt the nation. https://t.co/HRHF62ClnN,2019-02-25 15:48:28,Twitter Web Client,65,145

Big setback for #GreenNewDeal backers: Even far left liberals in CA say high-speed rail between LA and San Francisco is too expensive and will take too long to build. https://t.co/nBFoCrpUpW,2019-02-12 20:46:27,Twitter Web Client,110,242

The Green New Deal is a raw deal for the American taxpayer. It’s a socialist manifesto that lays out a laundry list of government giveaways including guaranteed food housing college &amp; economic security even for those who refuse to work. https://t.co/masquZRh86,2019-02-07 17:31:54,Twitter Web Client,101,250

I support @POTUS’s plan to reopen the government &amp; ensure furloughed federal employees are paid. Both parties must come together to address the security &amp; humanitarian crisis at our southern border. @POTUS has shown a willingness to compromise.
