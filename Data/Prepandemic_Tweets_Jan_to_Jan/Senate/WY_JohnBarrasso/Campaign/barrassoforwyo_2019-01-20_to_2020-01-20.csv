Every moment we spend on impeachment is time that we are not doing the work of the American people. Let's get through this trial and get to justice. https://t.co/kkynX2OudW,2020-01-16 20:32:04,Twitter Web App,0,4
Nancy Pelosi finally caved. Impeachment is on it's way to the Senate. The country is ready to move forward. It's time to get back to work for the American people and that's exactly what the Senate can bring to this process.,2020-01-15 22:16:28,Twitter Web App,0,1
Pelosi's impeachment process has been partisan since day one. Americans see through this political stunt. It's time to move to the trial in the Senate and then get back to the business of this country. https://t.co/zroSOXmGgh,2020-01-13 16:50:09,Twitter Web App,1,5
ICYMI: Yesterday I joined @AmericasNewsroom to talk about President Trump's decision to keep America safe. The President made the right decision and he saved American lives. https://t.co/RsWGlfWbvi,2020-01-07 15:23:22,Twitter Web App,1,4

A bipartisan watchdog @BudgetHawks’ new report on #MedicareForAll is telling. It makes clear that the Democrats’ plan to tax the rich to pay for their plan is: “IMPOSSIBLE.” Every taxpayer would shoulder the burden for this expensive healthcare plan. https://t.co/WLXD6UbOpz,2019-10-30 14:14:47,Tweetbot for Mac,0,0
The death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi immediately makes the world a safer and more secure place. Thankful to @POTUS our intelligence community and our brave servicemen and women who worked together to bring him down. https://t.co/ljL0JXtR5G,2019-10-27 15:18:39,Tweetbot for Mac,0,1
Construction of brand new wall along the southern border is progressing tremendously! By securing these new stretches of the border we can ensure a safer America where the rule of law is upheld. https://t.co/UycZgF0HKK,2019-09-19 21:30:05,joe.sentry,0,0
Today on this Constitution Day let's honor the vision and the principles of the founding fathers. The U.S. Constitution has stood the test of time and remains the centerpiece of our federal government 232 years later. https://t.co/ciloWnOFKH,2019-09-17 19:30:07,joe.sentry,0,1
The 2020 Democratic candidates have made this clear before and they will make it clear during the debate again tonight: The Democrats want a massive government takeover of our healthcare. I warn more about the dangers of the left's agenda here: https://t.co/N9B9NIG70U,2019-09-12 18:15:05,joe.sentry,0,0

Despite what the media tells you @POTUS's agenda is working &amp; the U.S. consumer confidence is as high as it's been in 19 years. With lower taxes higher wages and a steady job market the American people are reaping the benefits of this historic economy. https://t.co/wGUpSTI9He,2019-08-29 15:00:05,joe.sentry,0,2
I applaud @POTUS's decision to end the catch and release policy that was badly abused by coyotes and smugglers. This move will help remove the incentive for traffickers to come across our border while empowering DHS to keep families together. https://t.co/nP3I8oJbSJ,2019-08-22 14:00:04,joe.sentry,0,1
I urge House Democratic leaders to hold a vote on the USMCA trade agreement immediately. This important trade deal will help grow the economy and create over 100k new jobs. It's time to end the obstruction and put the American people first. https://t.co/0yVjbmqqJV,2019-08-16 14:00:06,joe.sentry,0,1
.@POTUS has nominated highly qualified &amp; constitutionally minded judges. Senate GOP is moving quickly - confirming over a dozen last week alone. But the Democrats continue to try to slow progress. Time for this unprecedented liberal obstruction to end. https://t.co/D5jPU5LoZ6,2019-08-07 18:00:04,joe.sentry,0,1
President Trump’s announcement to expand US beef exports to the European Union couldn’t come at a better time! I applaud the President’s work on securing a better deal for the American people. https://t.co/NVvpQWptVo,2019-08-05 22:05:04,joe.sentry,0,1
It's high time that we address America's infrastructure challenges. I'm proud to be leading a bi-partisan effort to meet the needs of our highway infrastructure.

Ever since it was introduced we've known the 'Green New Deal' to be a bad deal for America. Not only will it destroy the economy putting people out of well-paying jobs but it will cost you thousands as well. https://t.co/G6EyyxB0QV,2019-07-30 20:41:25,Twitter Web App,0,1

On this day in 1868 Congress formed the Wyoming Territory. 22 years later the Cowboy State would be admitted to the Union becoming the 44th state! https://t.co/smtVyzByGr,2019-07-25 19:45:08,joe.sentry,4,6
I have over 20 yrs of experience as an orthopedic surgeon &amp; I can tell you that liberal healthcare plans—like those put forth by Bernie Sanders—will force people to pay more to wait longer for worse care. We can’t afford socialized healthcare “solutions.” https://t.co/zC2l2km05n,2019-07-03 18:45:04,joe.sentry,0,0
Congrats to Wyo native Rob Wallace for being unanimously confirmed by the Senate as Assistant Secretary for Fish Wildlife and Parks at the Interior Department. I’ve known Rob for many years.

ICYMI: Last week the Senate passed my #USEIT Act. The legislation would support carbon utilization and direct air capture research. Happy to see this bipartisan infrastructure &amp; research investment move forward. https://t.co/xL9buSIfpz,2019-07-01 23:00:05,joe.sentry,0,0

If the Democrats are so proud of their Green New Deal they ought to stand up and vote for it. Instead they're ducking and refusing to let the American people know where they stand on this disastrous proposal. https://t.co/Fv97rr0RP3,2019-03-26 21:11:25,Twitter Web Client,0,0
Democrats in Congress have had one focus since @POTUS took office—ending his presidency by any means necessary. Mueller’s findings make it crystal clear: NO collusion. Will Democrats get back to work now? https://t.co/1wn6hnizG1,2019-03-26 15:18:48,Twitter Web Client,0,2
Ideas like the #GreenNewDeal and the abolition of private health insurance are two examples of unworkable and unaffordable ideas being floated by Democrats in Congress who seem intent on careening over the liberal cliff. https://t.co/XQYQc4Mxxh,2019-03-19 14:46:58,Tweetbot for Mac,0,0

The @AFLCIO is correct: the #GreenNewDeal would cause immediate harm to millions of people across the U.S. Individuals &amp; organizations from across the political spectrum are stepping up to oppose this burdensome expensive and overreaching legislation. https://t.co/Xzk7L7RTL1,2019-03-15 15:00:04,joe.sentry,0,1
Many #Democrats — from #AOC all the way to the top of their presidential ticket — are taking a sky-is-falling approach to everything. It’s not helpful it’s not how we should be legislating and even their fellow Democrats are expressing concerns. https://t.co/v7VgAwfC1P,2019-03-14 13:47:33,Tweetbot for Mac,0,3
I don’t blame Senate Dems for trying to duck this big green bomb that is the green new deal. You can’t escape the fact that nearly every Dem senator running supports it. Voting will give them the chance to vote for the policies they say they support. https://t.co/QqsaXRveE0,2019-03-04 21:56:22,Twitter Web Client,2,2
I’ve worked alongside PA's caring for WY families. These skilled &amp; dedicated professionals are a vital part of health care.

Local radio doesn't need any additional demands or burdens imposed on their stations by the gov.
