In Arizona ~54% of women are or have been family caregivers. When women step out of the workforce even temporarily to be caregivers they may lose out on Social Security &amp; Medicare benefits.

Great work by @CBPArizona officers.

Gov. Northam's comments condoning infanticide were shocking &amp; indefensible. There's no situation in which killing a newborn child should be legal &amp; the fact that the chief exec. of a state callously expressed support for such a policy is deeply disturbing. https://t.co/s6G5THr6yq,2019-01-31 22:31:14,Twitter Web Client,141,578

(1/4) I voted for a proposal to immediately re-open the gov't secure our southern border and provide humanitarian assistance.
