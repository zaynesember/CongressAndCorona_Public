There is simply no public health benefit to allowing these flavors to remain on the market.,2020-01-02 23:06:17,Twitter for iPhone,19,68
The Trump Administration announced today that it will ban the sale of some flavored e-cigarette pods and cartridge products such as those used in JUUL devices. While this is a step in the right direction this policy still has a number of gaping holes.,2020-01-02 23:06:17,Twitter for iPhone,25,111

Houston Police Chief Acevedo has it right.

For student borrowers defrauded by #4profit colleges @BetsyDeVosED is Secretary Scrooge this holiday season.

What is she waiting for? https://t.co/qvdMG4rf6F,2019-12-12 21:18:17,Twitter Web App,69,168
Secretary DeVos must stop stonewalling. Defrauded students like Keishana deserve this much-needed relief to which they are entitled under the law. It's disappointing that our Secretary of Education continues to side with #4profit colleges over the students they stole from.,2019-12-12 20:52:31,Twitter Web App,44,137

We heard one consistent reply from Inspector General Horowitz yesterday: there was no political motivation behind the FBI’s effort to find out if the Russians had compromised the Trump campaign.

We are in the midst of a vaping epidemic that has hooked 5 MILLION kids—an increase of 135% over the past 2 years of this presidency. It is clear that President Trump cares more about Big Tobacco’s profit margins than protecting our children from a lifetime of nicotine addiction.,2019-12-12 17:25:08,Twitter Web App,15,72

Rudy Giuliani often professes to be Pres. Trump’s personal lawyer. Occasionally the President acknowledges that.

It’s hard to keep up with all the ridiculous claims the President makes.   Let’s be clear—there were no spies in the Trump campaign. Inspector Horowitz's report should put that idea to bed.

Regardless of all the disinformation we heard at today’s hearing Inspector General Horowitz could not have been more clear in his report or in his testimony—the FBI’s 2016 Russia investigation was not influenced by political bias.,2019-12-11 22:16:35,Twitter Web App,52,188
Many of my Republican colleagues are obsessed with the emails and texts sent by Lisa Page and Peter Strzok.

We have seen many unqualified unfit judicial nominees under President Trump. Lawrence VanDyke is one of the worst. It’s a shame that my Republican colleagues have chosen to rubber-stamp his confirmation.,2019-12-11 21:51:11,Twitter Web App,58,160
Mr. VanDyke also has a long record of attacking LGBTQ rights and a woman’s right to choose. He refused to say that he believes same-sex couples can effectively raise children. His extreme statements make him entirely unfit to serve as a judge.,2019-12-11 21:51:10,Twitter Web App,36,110
Speaking of Montana—Mr. VanDyke only moved to Nevada the state where he will now serve as a judge after he failed to win office in Montana. He only became an active member of the NV bar in 2017. Why didn’t Republicans choose someone with longstanding NV ties?,2019-12-11 21:51:10,Twitter Web App,22,69
Emails show that Mr. VanDyke has let the gun lobby shape his litigation decisions. And during his unsuccessful campaign for the Montana Supreme Court he sought the NRA’s endorsement saying that gun control laws are “misdirected.” He prejudged the issue.,2019-12-11 21:51:10,Twitter Web App,32,59
The American Bar Association’s peer review process found Mr. VanDyke “not qualified” and described him as “arrogant lazy an ideologue and lacking in knowledge of the day-to-day practice.” Americans deserve qualified non-ideological judges with proper temperament.,2019-12-11 21:51:09,Twitter Web App,44,100

When it’s all said &amp; done in 2027 more than 80% of the benefits from the Republican tax bill will go to the top 1% of earners. And it will add $1.9 trillion to our national deficit. A real work of art from a party of so-called “fiscal conservatives.”,2019-12-11 19:33:19,Twitter Web App,36,111
We were told the Republican tax scam—which slashed the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%—would be an investment in America’s working families.

Mr. Menashi’s confirmation process was deeply troubling as is his confirmation today. Sadly he is but the latest in a long list of unqualified and unfit judicial nominees appointed by Pres. Trump and rubber-stamped by Senate Republicans.,2019-11-14 19:48:49,Twitter Web App,44,101

Mr. Menashi advised Betsy DeVos on some of the most anti-student measures the Dept. of Education has ever implemented.

Senate Republicans could have voted to protect health insurance for Americans with pre-existing conditions—such as diabetes asthma cancer or heart disease. Instead they backed President Trump’s proposal to allow discrimination against these individuals.,2019-10-30 18:59:04,Twitter Web App,103,210
Sadly Senate Republicans refused to stand with @SenateDems today in support of Americans with pre-existing conditions—a decision that will allow for the proliferation of “junk insurance plans” that discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions. https://t.co/VYgCVoCo9N,2019-10-30 18:59:04,Twitter Web App,145,287

Today @SenateDems will force a vote to overturn the Trump Admin’s latest assault on Americans w/pre-existing conditions. I hope my GOP colleagues will join us &amp; make this a bipartisan effort to tell Pres Trump that discriminating against those w/pre-existing conditions is wrong. https://t.co/dhB2ZqvnZT,2019-10-30 15:41:46,Twitter Web App,363,1196

Our bill provides new funding &amp; support for rural communities by expanding loan forgiveness programs to can attract and retain more doctors dentists behavioral health specialists &amp; nurses.

Patients across rural Illinois face challenges accessing the health care they need because of serious workforce shortages – w/ too few medical providers and long distances between them. That’s why I introduced the Rural America Health Corps Act w/ @RepCheri and @MarshaBlackburn.,2019-10-30 02:12:44,Twitter for iPhone,27,140
Great to welcome the @ILfoodbank team to Washington this afternoon. I am always inspired by your dedication to feeding so many Illinois families each year - thanks for all you do. https://t.co/BrUbsLvqIO,2019-10-29 23:48:39,Twitter for iPhone,18,67

Senate Republicans yet again objected to consideration of a bill that would help families nationwide. Senator McConnell’s legislative graveyard goes on. https://t.co/l60Mys5cYX,2019-10-29 21:51:39,Twitter for iPhone,156,373
Powerful story about victims’ family’s opposition to the first federal execution in 20 years. It’s time for Congress to pass my bill with @AyannaPressley @SenLeahy &amp; @SenBooker to place a ban on the arbitrary and unfair federal death penalty.  https://t.co/vTzDLg3VfR,2019-10-29 21:37:48,Twitter for iPhone,14,73

If Senate Republicans genuinely cared about the people of Venezuela they’d ask the President to grant TPS immediately. But they refuse to stand up to the President &amp; are instead trying to use this sad situation as an excuse to gut the entire TPS program-we won’t let that happen.,2019-10-29 20:45:25,Twitter for iPhone,20,67
.@SenatorMenendez and I have repeatedly asked Senate Republicans to pass this bill. They block it every time.   Of course President Trump could also grant Venezuelans TPS with the stroke of his pen but as expected he refuses to do so.,2019-10-29 20:45:24,Twitter for iPhone,15,54
This morning I went to the Senate floor to call on Senate Republicans to support the bipartisan House-passed legislation that would designate Venezuela for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) &amp; protect approximately 200000 Venezuelan nationals in the U.S. from deportation. https://t.co/aRyWR4x4gb,2019-10-29 20:45:24,Twitter for iPhone,31,138
.@US_FDA must follow through on its promise to ban e-cigarette flavors—including mint and menthol—that have hooked 5 million children on nicotine.

Is this any coincidence? Mr. Menashi certainly wasn’t picked for his courtroom experience – he has never tried a case argued an appeal conducted a deposition or even observed a full criminal trial. We must have higher standards than this for lifetime appointments.,2019-10-29 19:14:57,Twitter for iPhone,124,327
The Second Circuit hears appeals coming out of the Southern District of New York – where there are multiple investigations underway into Pres. Trump and his associates.

For decades the fossil fuel industry has pumped money into the political process in order to block any meaningful action on climate change &amp; to maintain their profit margins.

Senate Republicans are moving to confirm one unqualified judge after another. Now it’s Sarah Pitlyk of MO who has no trial experience &amp; radical views on reproductive rights. She’s been rated unanimously “not qualified” by the ABA but Senate Rs just don’t seem to care anymore.,2019-10-29 17:16:43,Twitter for iPhone,536,1004

More than a month ago President Trump promised to address our nation's gun violence epidemic. But he buckled under pressure from the NRA.   Sadly this President often displays conduct beneath the dignity of his office.,2019-10-28 21:39:02,Twitter Web App,573,3531
What kind of a U.S. President praises Russia and bashes Chicago?   Pres. Trump displayed a stunning dearth of dignity in Chicago today. Rather than focusing on positive solutions he chose to insult a great American city.,2019-10-28 21:39:02,Twitter Web App,9840,39180

The Vapor Tech Association is running ads with the misleading claim that “vaping is at least 95% safer than smoking.” Our nation’s top health agencies &amp; medical experts do not agree.

Senators on both sides of the aisle should have reservations about advancing a judicial nominee like former Betsy DeVos adviser Steven Menashi.
