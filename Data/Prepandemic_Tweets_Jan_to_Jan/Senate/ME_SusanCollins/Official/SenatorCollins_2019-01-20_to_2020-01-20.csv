I strongly believe that anyone who is qualified and wants to serve should continue to be allowed to do so including our transgender troops. We should be expressing our gratitude to those who serve our country in uniform not trying to kick them out of the military.,2019-02-08 23:20:10,Twitter Web Client,2186,16377

Well said @SenatorShaheen.  From Acadia to Denali and everywhere in between our bipartisan legislation would allow disabled veterans to more easily access our country’s national treasures for outdoor recreation which can help heal both the visible and invisible wounds of war. https://t.co/IAdkdeNLQr,2019-02-07 16:30:47,Twitter Web Client,61,414
LWCF our most important conservation program has created outdoor recreation opportunities across the country.

As a state w/ one of the most veterans per capita &amp; thousands of skilled shipyard workers ME has long been pivotal to our national security. It’s fitting that @USNAVY will name a new ship after our capital to honor the citizens who have answered the call to serve our country. https://t.co/8XxsifppRj,2019-02-03 13:00:12,Twitter Web Client,68,488
No individuals should be barred from serving on a jury because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. A bill I have introduced with @SenatorShaheen who is always a leader in the fight against discrimination would ensure this right. https://t.co/y2nQ2qOrEA,2019-02-02 17:09:01,Twitter Web Client,112,697

I am so proud of the key role the men and women of BIW have played in ensuring our service members have the most advanced technology equipment &amp; ships.

Rebates should lower the costs that consumers pay at the pharmacy counter not pad the pockets of middle men.

In ME we have only 40 geriatricians for more than 260000 people over 65   We're facing a nationwide shortage of these professionals. There are fewer than 7300 today &amp; we'll need 30000 by 2030  My &amp; @SenBobCasey's Geriatrics Workforce Improvement Act would help close this gap https://t.co/9fPk2Pu77k,2019-02-01 15:09:11,Twitter Media Studio,101,435
Americans lost $1.7 billion in 2016 to criminals who assumed their identity and filed false tax returns.
