Many Americans have served on a jury at some point. We know that in trials evidence is evaluated and witnesses are called.

If we're going to stem the tide of climate change so much more needs to be done—and we need to act fast.

President Trump and his administration must comply with the ongoing investigations and provide Congress – a coequal branch of government – with the information it is entitled to under the law. The American people deserve the truth.,2019-09-26 01:12:49,Twitter for iPhone,10,22
President Trump has broad deference when it comes to conducting U.S. foreign policy but he does not have the authority to undermine Congress or pressure a foreign government to help him smear a political opponent.,2019-09-26 01:12:48,Twitter for iPhone,8,16

Let’s be very clear: we could spend upwards of $40 billion building a wall from sea to shining sea but a wall alone will not deter those who fear from their lives in Central America from making the dangerous journey north.,2019-09-25 19:34:35,Twitter Web App,5,13
Raiding military funds and declaring an emergency in order to get around Congress's bipartisan objection to building an ineffective wall are not serious solutions. I welcome talks about ways to reduce irregular migration to the southern border but they must be based in facts.,2019-09-25 19:34:08,Twitter Web App,5,15
And when the President didn’t get his way he shamefully resorted to diverting $3.6 billion away from our service members their families and critical military projects to build an ineffective wall he promised Mexico would pay for.,2019-09-25 19:29:07,Twitter Web App,1,8
This was an easy vote. From the start the President’s national emergency declaration disregarded the facts set a dangerous precedent and ignored the will of American taxpayers as well as the authority of Congress. https://t.co/nLn9RTC9i0,2019-09-25 19:28:13,Twitter Web App,3,33

The details of their report are troubling to say the least: -Abuse in nursing homes across the country has more than doubled between 2013 and 2017 -Physical and mental/verbal abuse occurred most often in nursing homes -Staff were more often the perpetrators of the abuse,2019-07-23 15:36:53,Twitter Web App,3,2
Nearly 1.5 million Americans are in the care of nursing homes. They're our mothers fathers grandparents friends and they deserve the utmost care and respect.

At EPA’s air office it appears Mr. Wehrum and Mr. Harlow used positions of public trust to dismantle decades-old protections for clean air and climate at the behest of Hunton-associated groups. @SenWhitehouse and I are asking @EPAoig to examine this report and its findings https://t.co/UMBvw0L8DV,2019-07-22 22:17:17,Twitter Web App,21,24

In Delaware the Affordable Care Act has helped cut the uninsured rate nearly in half and health care premiums are down nearly 6% this year.  Republicans should work with Democrats to build on that progress not work to take away life-saving care from millions.,2019-07-09 14:58:51,Twitter Web App,14,23
There’s a lot on the line today.  The Fifth Circuit will hear oral arguments in a lawsuit filed by Republicans to completely invalidate the #ACA.

I want to thank Bob Mueller for completing yet another tour of duty for our nation.

Today Bob Mueller reiterated what's been clear since the Special Counsel's report was released:  1. We need to address Russian interference in our elections  2. The President has not been exonerated  3. And Congress has a constitutional duty to be a check on executive power,2019-05-29 21:18:21,Twitter for iPhone,29,94

Because of Trump's trade wars retaliation by our trading partners has made exports from Delaware $14.8 million more expensive for foreign buyers. In just 6 months last year @AgricultureDE estimates our state lost $28 million in agricultural revenue.   Our farmers deserve better,2019-05-28 14:18:48,Twitter Web Client,13,16
While I’m glad our farmers – who have been the collateral damage of @realDonaldTrump’s trade wars with China – will get some well-deserved relief I'm disappointed it's not a long-term solution.

.@EPAAWheeler: The #FuelEconomy rollback means “there will be 1000 lives saved a year”  @EPA career staff 6 months earlier: It will ⬆️ increase ⬆️ fatalities.

Another approach is passing the #PFAS Action Act of 2019 a law I authored with @SenCapito to designate #PFAS as a hazardous substance eligible for cleanup under the #Superfund law https://t.co/u3VnRuxiYv,2019-05-22 15:08:32,Twitter Web Client,5,8
One approach to addressing this concern lies in the #PFAS Release Disclosure Act authored by @SenCapito which I cosponsored with @gillibrandny – to better inform the public when those chemicals are released into the environment https://t.co/WZSOUJtWja,2019-05-22 15:05:05,Twitter Web Client,4,8
So it’s no surprise that many states are taking matters into their own hands and setting their own standards.

First @EPA’s 2019 #PFAS Action Plan largely includes commitments to consider whether to regulate PFAS contamination steps that Scott Pruitt announced almost a year earlier. https://t.co/lvqLk7LCsA,2019-05-22 14:56:06,Twitter Web Client,4,8
Today EPW is examining a range of bills to combat #PFAS contamination. These persistent chemicals threaten the drinking water of millions – including families in Delaware. You'd think that this would lead the @EPA to respond with urgency. That has not been the case:,2019-05-22 14:54:47,Twitter Web Client,10,14
Our colleagues in industry often remind Congress that #PFAS chemicals are used in everything from medical devices to solar panels.   That’s really not the point.   We want PFAS chemicals to stay in the solar panels and out of the drinking water.,2019-05-22 14:54:47,Twitter Web Client,6,13
I understand that the use of #PFAS in firefighting foam for example has supported our military readiness and saved lives. But the cruel irony is that when PFAS winds up in a glass on the kitchen table those same chemicals can endanger lives.,2019-05-22 14:54:46,Twitter Web Client,6,10

Well that's just entirely untrue @realDonaldTrump. An accurate #2020Census will impact decisions made at all levels of our government and at businesses that drive our economy.

Last month @RepDonBeyer and I traveled with our colleagues to the Northern Triangle to see firsthand the conditions that force so many in the region to flee for their lives and seek safe haven at our Southern border.

In 2015 @Equifax learned it had thousands of cyber vulnerabilities but did not address those known security issues.   Unsurprisingly in 2017 @Equifax experienced a massive breach that exposed the sensitive data over 145 million Americans.,2019-03-07 17:24:09,Twitter Web Client,5,9
You would think that protecting the sensitive information its entire business relies on would be @Equifax’s top priority. Yet my report with @senrobportman illustrates years-long neglect of basic cybersecurity practices. https://t.co/sBZqsX11uH,2019-03-07 17:23:22,Twitter Web Client,5,7

When hackers obtain someone's person information the consequences are real. The constant stream of data breaches we see year in and year out are a sign to me that we could and should be doing a lot better.   That is certainly the case with @Equifax.,2019-03-07 17:08:34,Twitter Web Client,7,28

Today’s announcement explains why @EPAAWheeler would not commit to set a drinking water standard for #PFAS during his nomination hearing last month. I was disappointed when I heard it the first time and I’m even more discouraged today.   Watch that exchange here: https://t.co/8OYl5xuuS6,2019-02-14 16:06:01,Twitter Web Client,14,34
UPDATE: No #PFAS drinking water standard in today's announcement from @EPA.  It has taken them nearly a year just to kick the can even further down the road and present a plan that is insufficiently protective.

President Trump views the Attorney General not as a lawyer to defend the rights of all Americans but as a “fixer” who should look out for his interests.
