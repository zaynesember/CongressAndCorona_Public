The fact is our nation can’t afford to play political games with the Census.,2019-06-03 19:07:19,Twitter for iPhone,1,1
This isn’t surprising but it is deeply disturbing. New evidence has emerged to confirm that the motivation behind the GOP's push to add a citizenship question to the Census is to give "Republicans and non-Hispanic whites" an electoral advantage. https://t.co/tTDCXCK2Vt,2019-06-03 19:07:18,Twitter for iPhone,1,2

Now as a reminder— members of Congress have duties that we are bound by the American people to perform. These duties are laid out in the Constitution.,2019-05-24 22:08:43,Twitter for iPhone,0,1
President Trump had a temper tantrum and left the room— and then held a surprise press conference to say that he’s refusing to allow us to legislate while investigations into his conduct continue.,2019-05-24 22:08:43,Twitter for iPhone,0,1

The American people deserve an Attorney General who’s squarely on their side. Sadly Pres. Trump nominated someone whose record suggests that he’ll only be on the President’s side. That’s why I voted against the confirmation of his nominee William Barr.,2019-02-15 03:45:32,Twitter for iPhone,0,2
