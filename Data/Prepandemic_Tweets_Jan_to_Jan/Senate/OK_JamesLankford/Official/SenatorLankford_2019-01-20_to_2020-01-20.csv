Work adds value &amp; purpose to life &amp; we should provide opportunities for all who are able. For those who aren’t it’s vital that our social safety nets are there to take care of those in need.,2020-01-18 19:02:50,Twitter Web App,5,17
It’s been a long road but after 50 years #SocialSecurity disability will reflect a 21st century economy. Thanks @realDonaldTrump for pushing these much-needed changes over the finish line.,2020-01-18 19:02:49,Twitter Web App,9,16
In 2015 I offered an amendment to the Budget Act that would improve the process &amp; prevent those from receiving #SocialSecurity disability who aren't disabled. Part of that amendment again included updating the grid.,2020-01-18 19:02:49,Twitter Web App,3,3
We have been fighting for updates for years. In 2014 I requested that the Acting Commissioner make 11 reforms to #SocialSecurity disability that they had agency authority to change and didn’t need congressional approval for. One of those was updating the grid.,2020-01-18 19:02:49,Twitter Web App,3,3
The grid hasn’t been updated since 1978. Because of that the eligibility criteria doesn’t include modern day jobs that use 21st century technologies.,2020-01-18 19:02:48,Twitter Web App,1,3
Under the current system part of #SocialSecurity disability eligibility is defined by an employment grid which is a list of every job in the marketplace. It is used with a decision-making tool that factors things like age education &amp; work experience.,2020-01-18 19:02:48,Twitter Web App,2,1
Big news for the future of @SocialSecurity disability program. The eligibility criteria hasn't been meaningfully updated since 1978 leaving many on disability even though there are opportunities for those who want to work. https://t.co/pN2PUzG8iU,2020-01-18 19:02:48,Twitter Web App,11,30

During the 25 day impeachment process in the House @SpeakerPelosi insisted they had to hurry and had no time call to witnesses because it was so urgent. Then the House held the impeachment papers for 25 days before they sent them to the Senate.,2020-01-15 14:08:00,Twitter Web App,56,288

@CBP wasn't meant to house folks or process them into the US/return them to their home country if they don't have legal justification for being here.,2019-07-23 18:44:28,Twitter Web App,1,8
Here's the problem with that: the need to process still exists. But if @ICEgov can’t do their job as intended it falls to @CBP to do it. So rather than @CBP’s specific mission to be law enforcement on the border they now are doing their job AND @ICEgov’s job of detention.,2019-07-23 18:44:27,Twitter Web App,1,9
But recently there has been an effort by Democrats to limit the amount of beds available.,2019-07-23 18:44:27,Twitter Web App,1,7
That bed is an important part of the conversation–@ICEgov receives funding for that mission by the bed. The amount of money is connected to the number of beds it has–and that’s how many people it can have in its facility at any given time.,2019-07-23 18:44:27,Twitter Web App,1,8
For others law enforcement is waiting on their criminal history from their home country. @ICEgov facilities should be the primary place they received medical care additional resources and a bed to sleep in.,2019-07-23 18:44:26,Twitter Web App,1,6
Under current law when an adult or family unit is caught by @CBP they should be processed in the facility and then transferred to @ICEgov while more information came in. If that individual makes an asylum claim they do so w/ @CBP.,2019-07-23 18:44:26,Twitter Web App,1,5
Unaccompanied minors are still coming across but so are family units who stay together while they are processed. More space is needed for @CBP to conduct its mission.,2019-07-23 18:44:25,Twitter Web App,2,6
@CBP mission is to process people coming across the border through non-approved channels (i.e. without a passport a visa or a legal reason to be present).,2019-07-23 18:44:25,Twitter Web App,2,6
But an important part of the story is that this was always supposed to be a short-term facility before unaccompanied minors could be put in the care of @HHSGov or returned to their home country.,2019-07-23 18:44:24,Twitter Web App,2,5

Senate cleared a bipartisan humanitarian aid bill to support children &amp; families in crisis at the border. Admin first requested $$ 57 days ago &amp; the situation has deteriorated since then.

This is not that hard. But it’s become this horrible partisan issue that I think all of us are really frustrated with. It’s time to fix this.,2019-06-26 19:20:05,Twitter Web App,9,49
This should not be about hurting @RealDonaldTrump &amp; his presidential hopes for next year. This is about a group of kids that need help to reduce the incentive for them to cross the border illegally &amp; take care of the folks that are already here.,2019-06-26 19:20:04,Twitter Web App,8,35
Now we finally have an agreement on aid &amp; the House responds with a partisan bill &amp; uses it to try to negotiate a vote on defense bill. Yet ANOTHER delay. You can’t have it both ways.,2019-06-26 19:20:04,Twitter Web App,20,68

Then yesterday @SenSchumer was back on the floor criticizing @realDonaldTrump asking why aren’t we taking care of the kids? When @HSGAC has worked on it for months. We’ve asked for it for months &amp; all we got was we’ll get to unrelated issues later.,2019-06-26 19:20:03,Twitter Web App,4,8
Unrelated to humanitarian issues translation. Let’s put it off until later.,2019-06-26 19:20:02,Twitter Web App,1,4

Congress didn’t do anything. I’ve had personal convos w/Dems &amp; GOP Members-at what point do we admit the obvious statement that Obama &amp; Trump Admins made? If we don’t resolve Flores settlement this will not get better b/c traffickers will cont to move children across border.,2019-06-26 19:20:00,Twitter Web App,1,5
DHS went on to say “My greatest concern is for the children who are put at high risk by this emergency &amp; who are arriving sicker than ever before after traveling on the treacherous trek.”,2019-06-26 19:20:00,Twitter Web App,1,4
On 3/28/19 DHS asked Congress to address emergency @ border. DHS- “We now face a system-wide meltdown. DHS facilities are overflowing agents &amp; offers are stretched too thin &amp; the magnitude of arriving &amp; detained aliens has increased the risk of life-threatening incidents.”,2019-06-26 19:19:59,Twitter Web App,2,4
