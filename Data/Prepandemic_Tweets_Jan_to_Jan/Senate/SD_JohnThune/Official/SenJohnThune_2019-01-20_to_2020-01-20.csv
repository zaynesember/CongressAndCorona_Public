#USMCA just passed the Senate &amp; is approaching the finish line.🎉 SD exports to Canada &amp; Mexico topped $1.1 billion in 2017. By increasing certainty about trade with 2 key trading partners #USMCA will benefit almost every sector of our economy from manufacturing to agriculture. https://t.co/P4lblbrpQz,2020-01-16 17:07:30,Twitter Media Studio,308,1223
The Senate has passed the modernized #USMCA trade deal. I was happy to be one of 89 senators to vote YES. This agreement will open markets for South Dakota farmers and ranchers who have struggled for too long in today’s agriculture economy. https://t.co/yeGR6ypRLF,2020-01-16 17:00:24,Twitter Web App,16,111

After months of delay by House Dems #USMCA is finally moving through Congress. Here in the Republican-led Senate we understand the importance of this deal &amp; have advanced it rapidly through the 7 required committees.

The list of Iranian terror activities is long. In December Iran-backed militia Kataib Hezbollah fired more than 30 rockets killing an American contractor &amp; wounding U.S. troops.

While @SenateDems don’t seem concerned about raising costs or destroying jobs they are concerned that their #GreenNewDeal won’t eliminate cow emissions and airplanes fast enough.   I wish I were joking. https://t.co/Ddkm7pIbbE,2019-02-07 23:30:01,Twitter Media Studio,28,100
Having previously held this position there’s no doubt that Bill Barr is qualified to serve once again as attorney general. I look forward to supporting his nomination when it comes before the full Senate. https://t.co/m5NBcKDI3n,2019-02-06 22:33:17,TweetDeck,20,111

It’s hard to imagine anyone objecting to protecting a baby that is born alive. But last night Democrats objected to a bill that would do just that. https://t.co/PBcsAwsNNC,2019-02-05 19:45:00,Twitter Media Studio,1209,2252
