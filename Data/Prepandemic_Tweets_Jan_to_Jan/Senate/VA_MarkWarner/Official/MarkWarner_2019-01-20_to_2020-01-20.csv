By putting some basic rules of the road in place we can preserve your privacy while increasing competition and openness.   That’s good for consumers.   It’s good the economy.   And ultimately I believe it will be good for the internet.,2019-10-22 14:12:59,Twitter Web App,13,58
We need to put users back in the driver’s seat – controlling their data the basis on which it’s shared and with whom it’s shared. If we want to preserve American innovation we need to lower entry barriers and create space for the next great innovative U.S. networks.,2019-10-22 14:12:59,Twitter Web App,22,59
Long thread but we’re talking about some fundamental questions about the future of the internet and who our data belongs to.,2019-10-22 14:12:59,Twitter Web App,11,28
But there are services out there that allow users to delegate those responsibilities in a secure way and our legislation would make sure consumers can take advantage of them.,2019-10-22 14:12:23,Twitter Web App,5,17
If someone wants to manage their privacy settings individually across every single service that has their data that’s their right.,2019-10-22 14:12:23,Twitter Web App,5,18
Third we need to preserve delegatability — the idea that consumers should be able to allow a third-party service to manage their privacy settings across multiple platforms.,2019-10-22 14:12:22,Twitter Web App,7,15
By requiring interoperability for major platforms we can give consumers greater choice over how they access online services like social media while also preventing companies from using their APIs &amp; terms of service as weapons to shut down potential competitors or extract rents.,2019-10-22 14:12:22,Twitter Web App,6,16
No surprise: it drove online competition and created space for today’s services.,2019-10-22 14:12:22,Twitter Web App,4,12
Back in 2001 the FCC recognized that interoperability was key to competition and required then-dominant AOL to make its instant messaging service compatible with its competitors.  https://t.co/vYMj5ShW63,2019-10-22 14:12:22,Twitter Web App,9,23
I promised plain English so let me give you an example: E-mail is an interoperable service built on open standards. Can you imagine if you were only able to email people with the same email provider? Or if you had to pay a $10/month to email outside your provider?,2019-10-22 14:12:21,Twitter Web App,4,15
So if we really want competition between different providers we need to go beyond portability and ensure interoperability between different platforms — for messages cat videos and the many other types of online content.,2019-10-22 14:12:21,Twitter Web App,3,15
But that also means portability isn't enough if there's nobody to share content or communicate with on a new network or service.,2019-10-22 14:12:20,Twitter Web App,2,11
Social media platforms are governed by a concept called network effects: it means a platform is more valuable — to both the operator and users — the more people are on it.,2019-10-22 14:12:20,Twitter Web App,2,12
Second for data portability to really make a difference we need to break down the anti-competitive barriers that companies put up to limit their competitors from interacting with their platforms.   This is the idea behind interoperability the open exchange of information.,2019-10-22 14:12:20,Twitter Web App,6,13
We live in an era where personalization and predictive analytics make the difference between a successful engaging app and a dull frustrating app. So users’ ability to port their data – to in effect vote with their wallets – can catalyze competition.,2019-10-22 14:12:19,Twitter Web App,3,13
Is the internet more complicated? Maybe but with machine-readable formats like CSV XML and JSON the technology is already there.   The primary barrier is that companies don’t want to ease restrictions that protect their market dominance.,2019-10-22 14:12:19,Twitter Web App,3,16
But sure enough when Congress mandated local number portability it drove companies to compete for their customers' business and consumers benefitted as a result.,2019-10-22 14:12:19,Twitter Web App,4,12
For years people were reluctant to change phone providers because they didn’t want to lose their number — putting the burden on consumers to circulate new contact info potentially missing calls from contacts who still had their old number. It was a major switching cost.,2019-10-22 14:12:18,Twitter Web App,3,15
This would return control of data to users and create new opportunities for competition.   We know this because we’ve done it before with phone numbers.,2019-10-22 14:12:18,Twitter Web App,6,15
First consumers ought to have the ability to switch social media platforms and other online services without having to start from scratch. This idea of data portability would allow you to take all your data ~ including your cat videos ~ and move it to a different service.,2019-10-22 14:12:18,Twitter Web App,8,19
The ACCESS Act has three main components that would apply to the largest tech platforms:   1. Portability  2. Interoperability 3. Delegatability  Here’s what that means in plain English:,2019-10-22 14:12:17,Twitter Web App,15,26
To accomplish this we’ve introduced a bill called the ACCESS Act which stands for the Augmenting Compatibility and Competition by Enabling Service Switching Act (thank you bill-naming interns).,2019-10-22 14:12:17,Twitter Web App,6,20
If we want to change that we need to remove the current barriers to consumer choice and put Americans back in control of their data and their communications.,2019-10-22 14:12:17,Twitter Web App,5,14
American consumers are rightfully growing frustrated with the fact that you have to effectively sign over your private data in order to use an internet that is mediated largely via a handful of platforms that have come to dominate it.,2019-10-22 14:12:16,Twitter Web App,8,18
For many tech companies their most valuable asset is Americans’ private data. As a result the task of defending your online privacy is pretty daunting. Many companies employ byzantine frequently-changing privacy settings that are often specifically designed against users.,2019-10-22 14:12:16,Twitter Web App,5,19
This is especially true in the digital marketplace where the unchecked rise of a few dominant tech platforms has undermined users’ ability to meaningfully control their online lives.,2019-10-22 14:12:15,Twitter Web App,5,19
This legislation is rooted in the idea that competition in the private sector is key to America’s economic success.   Without it consumer choice suffers technological innovation suffers and America’s global competitiveness suffers.,2019-10-22 14:12:15,Twitter Web App,7,23

That means passing the #HonestAds Act so online political ads have to follow the same transparency rules as radio TV and print ads. https://t.co/7z7BJMQ6pE,2019-10-10 18:26:25,TweetDeck,130,384

Bottom line: it is Congress’s responsibility to listen to the warnings of our Intelligence Community and take steps to prevent future attacks from being waged on our own social media platforms. This report provides a roadmap for how we do that going forward.,2019-10-08 17:07:40,Twitter Web App,363,1213
Finally the Committee recommends candidates campaigns the media and other public figures scrutinize sourcing before sharing or promoting new content within their social media networks.,2019-10-08 17:07:40,Twitter Web App,218,786
The Committee also recommends the Executive Branch publicly reinforce the danger of attempted foreign interference in the 2020 election by setting up an interagency task force that can coordinate the federal government’s response to this threat.,2019-10-08 17:07:39,Twitter Web App,225,746
And because information warfare campaigns are waged across a variety of platforms we also need to encourage greater communication and information sharing between individual companies government authorities and law enforcement.,2019-10-08 17:07:39,Twitter Web App,190,676
More fundamentally we need to give Americans more control over their data and how it’s used and make sure that they know who’s really bankrolling the political ads coming across their screens.,2019-10-08 17:07:39,Twitter Web App,245,847
At a minimum we need to demand transparency around social media to prevent our adversaries from hiding in its shadows. That includes guaranteeing that companies are identifying inauthentic user accounts and pages and appropriately handling defamatory or synthetic content.,2019-10-08 17:07:38,Twitter Web App,279,891
As was made clear in 2016 we cannot expect social media companies to take adequate precautions on their own. Congress must step up and establish guardrails to protect the integrity of our democracy.   Here’s what the Committee recommends on a bipartisan basis:,2019-10-08 17:07:38,Twitter Web App,258,804
The Russian playbook is out in the open for other foreign and domestic adversaries to expand upon – and their techniques will only get more sophisticated. The question is what are we going to do about it?,2019-10-08 17:07:37,Twitter Web App,276,793
Now with the 2020 elections on the horizon there’s no doubt that bad actors will continue to try to weaponize the scale and reach of social media platforms to erode public confidence and foster chaos.,2019-10-08 17:07:37,Twitter Web App,255,758
I cannot stress this enough: the Committee found that Russia’s efforts continue to this day. In fact we found that this activity increased rather than decreased after Election Day 2016.,2019-10-08 17:07:37,Twitter Web App,854,1681
Russians engaged with unwitting Americans to further their reach beyond the digital realm and into real-world activities. For example IRA operatives targeting African-Americans convinced individuals to sign petitions share personal information and teach self-defense courses.,2019-10-08 17:07:36,Twitter Web App,240,666
Importantly the Committee found the Internet Research Agency specifically targeted African-Americans more than any other group or demographic.,2019-10-08 17:07:36,Twitter Web App,320,821
The Internet Research Agency (IRA)'s targeting of the 2016 election was intended to help Trump and hurt Clinton but it was part of a much broader sophisticated and *ongoing* information warfare campaign designed to sow discord in American politics and society.,2019-10-08 17:07:36,Twitter Web App,316,867
In 2016 Russia took advantage of our openness and innovation exploiting American-bred social media platforms to spread disinformation divide the public and undermine our democracy.,2019-10-08 17:07:35,Twitter Web App,265,834
The Senate Intelligence Committee just released its report on Russia’s use of social media during the 2016 election. You can read the whole thing for yourself but here are the important takeaways and recommendations: https://t.co/GZvH0NmADf,2019-10-08 17:07:35,Twitter Web App,3292,5042

Virginia set up its #AshantiAlert system in just 3 months. Yet in the 9 months since the Ashanti Alert Act became law we’ve seen little progress from @TheJusticeDept.

This is one of those country-over-party moments. We should all be able to agree that this assault on the whistleblower process from the President and his allies needs to end immediately.,2019-09-30 16:23:48,Twitter Web App,332,1533
These allegations must be investigated in a bipartisan way. But regardless of what comes from these allegations against the President we must protect the integrity of the whistleblower process.,2019-09-30 16:23:48,Twitter Web App,158,1056
The role of the intelligence community is to speak truth to power and with the IC already under assault from this administration there’s no question that this President’s latest comments will have a chilling effect on the men and women who guard our secrets and keep us safe.,2019-09-30 16:23:47,Twitter Web App,152,895
If those are the only avenues for accountability within the intelligence community the United States is in big trouble.,2019-09-30 16:23:47,Twitter Web App,106,815
A future whistleblower could leak the information to the press with no protections in place to safeguard classified information or they could say nothing and let the wrongdoing continue. Both hurt us and help our adversaries.,2019-09-30 16:23:47,Twitter Web App,130,931
Why? Consider the alternatives.  If someone in the intelligence community witnesses something bad that jeopardizes our national security where can they go if they can’t report it internally?,2019-09-30 16:23:47,Twitter Web App,149,943
The whole reason we have whistleblower protections is so intelligence professionals can report wrongdoing *without fear of retaliation.*,2019-09-30 16:23:46,Twitter Web App,199,1186
This President’s comments about “spies and treason” and “what we used to do in the old days” are totally unacceptable and will do serious damage far beyond this news cycle.,2019-09-30 16:23:46,Twitter Web App,288,1553
We are going to get to the bottom of the whistleblower’s allegations but we cannot lose sight of how truly dangerous the President’s response to these allegations has been. https://t.co/S7F1eTZzGj,2019-09-30 16:23:46,Twitter Web App,2999,11974

The thing is none of these issues are partisan. I’m working with Republicans on almost all of these ideas. That’s why it’s so frustrating to see the President try to center the debate around this fictional issue of “social media bias.”,2019-07-11 16:03:34,Twitter Web Client,79,275

The President’s tax law blew a ~$1.9 TRILLION hole in the national debt and most of that tax cut went to big businesses and the wealthiest Americans.  Working families deserve a real tax cut.

Whatever Julian Assange's intentions were for WikiLeaks what he’s become is a direct participant in Russian efforts to weaken the West and undermine American security.

The President’s healthcare plan is to strip coverage from millions of Americans wipe out Medicaid expansion and end protections for pre-existing medical conditions. That’s it. https://t.co/3STcXD6NvT,2019-04-10 18:45:34,Twitter for iPhone,820,1230
Mr. Barr knows how counter-intel investigations work. He knows there was ample evidence of Russian attempts to infiltrate the Trump campaign and that the FBI took lawful action to stop it. Giving a wink and a nod to this long-debunked “spying” conspiracy theory is irresponsible.,2019-04-10 17:30:55,Twitter Web Client,7302,21541

More and more consumers are being targeted with manipulative online practices that try to trick them into handing over personal information – and this problem is not going away on its own.

Transparency means releasing the entire Mueller report to Congress and releasing to the public as much as possible as quickly as possible without jeopardizing intelligence sources and methods. Anything less is unacceptable. https://t.co/ja3NFzDNO4,2019-04-09 21:13:45,Twitter Web Client,387,1405

The goal of the DETOUR Act is simple: instill a little transparency in what remains a very opaque market and make sure that consumers are able to make more informed choices about how and when to share their personal information.,2019-04-09 17:00:51,Twitter Web Client,33,134
It would also require informed consent for behavioral experimentation on users and prohibit user design intended to create compulsive usage among children under 13 years of age.,2019-04-09 17:00:51,Twitter Web Client,21,97
The Deceptive Experiences to Online Users Reduction (DETOUR) Act aims to curb dark patterns by prohibiting the largest online platforms (&gt; 100 million monthly active users) from relying on user interfaces that intentionally impair user autonomy decision-making or choice.,2019-04-09 17:00:50,Twitter Web Client,25,88
I think folks have a right to know if social media companies are using them as guinea pigs and especially if you’re being emotionally manipulated by an experiment.,2019-04-09 17:00:50,Twitter Web Client,19,85
For example it was reported in 2014 that Facebook conducted an experiment involving nearly 700000 users to study the emotional impact of manipulating information on their News Feeds. https://t.co/YJR6Gs3ZuM,2019-04-09 17:00:50,Twitter Web Client,23,63
These design tactics drawn from extensive behavioral psychology research are frequently used by social media platforms to mislead consumers into agreeing to settings and practices advantageous to the company.,2019-04-09 17:00:49,Twitter Web Client,17,74
Case in point: privacy settings that push users to ‘agree’ as the default option while users looking for more privacy-friendly options often must click through a much longer process detouring through multiple screens.,2019-04-09 17:00:49,Twitter Web Client,10,74
Some of these #DarkPatterns like the fake hairs may just cause some minor inconvenience. But too often large social media platforms have relied on all sorts of tricks to convince users to hand over their personal data without really understanding what they are consenting to.,2019-04-09 17:00:49,Twitter Web Client,11,71
This one might take the cake: using fake hairs or smudges to trick people into clicking mobile ads. https://t.co/BIOLjtJMwS,2019-04-09 17:00:48,Twitter Web Client,121,259
Using drop-down sections or discolored text to hide information or opt-in checkboxes? Yep #DarkPatterns. https://t.co/FWy5AG4EK9,2019-04-09 17:00:47,Twitter Web Client,19,81
Can you tell which of these buttons is a legitimate download link and which ones are ads? Your guess is as good as mine. “Disguised Ads” are another type of dark pattern. https://t.co/PYHrkyAHjS,2019-04-09 17:00:47,Twitter Web Client,24,102
Pop-ups like this one that force you to click one of the buttons in order to access the website is another example of a dark pattern. Ditto for “confirshaming” techniques like this which guilt users into taking an action like signing up for a company’s email list. https://t.co/KWfVtLNzvY,2019-04-09 17:00:47,Twitter Web Client,22,95
I don’t know about you but I hate it when I go to buy something online only to see the price jump right as I’m about to check out. Those hidden costs are another type of dark pattern. https://t.co/3pjOmmdfFt,2019-04-09 17:00:46,Twitter Web Client,17,88
Ever run into a bunch of contradictory checkboxes that try to trick you into signing up for someone’s email list? That’s a dark pattern. https://t.co/7UoR2h0xKc,2019-04-09 17:00:45,Twitter Web Client,19,73
These techniques range from mildly annoying to deeply insidious. Here are some examples of #DarkPatterns you may have seen online:,2019-04-09 17:00:45,Twitter Web Client,13,43
You might not have heard of a “dark pattern” but chances are you’ve seen these annoying manipulative designs trying to trick you into clicking buying or signing up for something you don’t want.

There are two ways to approach this issue: either we accept this inequity as a fact of life or we look for ways to change it. For my part I refuse to accept the notion that women should earn eighty cents — or less — on the dollar compared to their average male counterpart.,2019-04-02 20:16:27,Twitter Web Client,7,35
Here's a chart that really drives the point home. https://t.co/axeTXzJj5P,2019-04-02 20:16:27,Twitter Web Client,12,27
We know that the gender pay gap exists all across the economy stemming from a number of factors including discrimination implicit bias barriers to entry and advancement in certain fields and the responsibilities of parenting that disproportionately fall to women.,2019-04-02 20:16:27,Twitter Web Client,7,27
Let’s also recognize that this disparity is even greater for women of color. #EqualPayDay for Black women will fall on August 22nd followed by Native American women on September 23rd and Latino women on November 20th.,2019-04-02 20:16:26,Twitter Web Client,11,31
On average women are paid eighty cents on the dollar compared to their male counterparts. In Virginia that number is $0.78. It’s not right and we need to do more to achieve #EqualPay across the country. Let’s start by passing the #PaycheckFairnessAct. #EqualPayDay,2019-04-02 20:16:26,Twitter Web Client,109,401
