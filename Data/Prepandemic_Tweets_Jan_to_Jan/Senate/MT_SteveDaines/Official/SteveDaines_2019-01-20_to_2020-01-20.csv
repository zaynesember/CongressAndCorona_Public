Good news. I’m glad to see this decision for our Blue Water Navy Vietnam Vets. This is about fairness. All Vietnam Vets exposed to agent orange deserve equal care whether they served on land or by sea.  https://t.co/ofUSS6IBWB,2019-01-30 18:50:15,Twitter Web Client,19,42

I’m happy to see the government re-open. Both sides need to continue to negotiate and compromise in good faith so we can have a permanent &amp; real solution to keep the government open and secure our borders.,2019-01-25 20:21:01,Twitter Web Client,76,525
@realDonaldTrump wants to secure the border and open up the government resolving the impasse.  Schumer’s latest position is not reasonable.  Zero wall funding?  It’s time to negotiate and move forward. https://t.co/06gBWyKUmr,2019-01-25 03:28:15,Twitter for iPhone,14,61
I’m disappointed to see @realDonaldTrump’s bipartisan proposal to open our government and secure our borders fail especially when the Dems have voted on similar bills in the past. I stand ready to vote to open our gov secure our borders and get our workers paid.,2019-01-24 23:34:40,Twitter for iPhone,64,466
