Congratulations to Arkansas’s own Dave and @marrs_jenny Marrs on the premiere of their show. They’re a great family and deserve this type of success.

9-11-01 serves as a reminder that our security &amp; way of life can be threatened at any moment - with tragic consequences. But it also taught us to rely on the bonds that unite us to find comfort and courage. We will #neverforget the lives lost and forever changed that day. #Sept11,2019-09-11 23:59:25,Twitter for iPhone,2,10

Two Democratic presidential candidates have visited Arkansas in the last few days but no amount of campaign rhetoric can change or distort the facts. Our state is moving in the right direction - from the economy to education and more - under conservative leadership. #arpx @ARGOP,2019-08-18 13:25:11,Twitter for iPhone,11,56
Great to be with so many @ARGOP faithful in Little Rock today to offer my support for @TomCottonAR as he officially kicks off his campaign for US Senate.

Congratulations on this exciting news @alicetweet. The students and campus culture at Harvard’s @Kennedy_School will be better for having your voice and insights as part of the conversation. Good luck and we’ll still see you on @CNN.  https://t.co/PpLSYF6DZs,2019-07-01 23:47:45,Twitter for iPhone,1,15

“That so many Americans have given up their lives on the battlefield is something we should never take for granted.

Always a pleasure to join the Arkansas Federation of Republican Women. Folks like them help mobilize our grassroots in support of conservative Arkansas values. We appreciate everything they do and will continue relying on their leadership and advocacy. @ARGOP #arpx https://t.co/tl4PjcIPGc,2019-03-29 00:14:05,Twitter for iPhone,1,5
The #GreenNewDeal is a left-wing socialist takeover which I voted to reject. Arkansans don’t need to be taxed &amp; regulated into oblivion to pay for its trillions in costs and new mandates. More big government is not the answer — in fact it’s the problem.  https://t.co/Q5Ut94WytT,2019-03-27 00:18:02,Twitter for iPhone,3,9
Incredibly disappointed in this outcome. We owe babies who survive abortion the same care &amp; treatment any other newborn would receive. Anything less is a tragedy and a stain on our character. America is better than this &amp; I have faith that respect for all human life will prevail. https://t.co/0AzNs7po33,2019-02-26 03:32:11,Twitter for iPhone,3,13
Great to have a friend and colleague like @SenatorTimScott in Arkansas. He’s someone I really admire who is always trying to bring people together and find solutions that move America forward.
