#Iraq is reconsidering its relationship with the U.S.?   A relationship in which we give them $2 billion a year &amp; they privately beg us to stay &amp; help them fight #ISIS &amp; counter-balance #Iran. But they get to publicly condemn us for protecting our troops?  https://t.co/Qu8zhKhGS8,2020-01-04 14:21:00,Twitter for iPad,1332,4276
Easy for foreign “leaders” to condemn U.S. strikeit wasn’t their troops facing imminent attack  And easy for media to say no proof that these threats were differentbecause its highly classified intelligence that can’t be disclosed without putting sources &amp; methods used at risk,2020-01-04 14:12:00,Twitter for iPad,2715,10595
Bottom line.  What should a President do if he/she is presented with CLEAR intelligence than an enemy is about to carry out an attack that would kill hundreds of American troops?   I know what I want him/her to do. What @realDonaldTrump did.  4/4,2020-01-04 13:26:00,Twitter for iPad,410,1850
3. Claim that Trump hasn’t explained why this is in our strategic interest is absurd. #Soleimani was in Iraq to direct attacks that would have killed hundreds of Americans. Saving U.S. lives &amp; preventing the war that would result from their death is a strategic interest. 3/4,2020-01-04 13:26:00,Twitter for iPad,230,1129
2. @realDonaldTrump didn’t take sides between an intolerant Sunni regime in Saudi Arabia &amp; an intolerant Shiite regime in #Iran. He took sides between an intolerant regime trying to kill Americans &amp; destroy #Israel &amp; an intolerant regime that isn’t. 2/4,2020-01-04 13:26:00,Twitter for iPad,102,368
.@washingtonpost op-ed is wrong on many fronts  1. When @potus took over the threat from #Iran was not “manageable”.

Below see my tweet from 8 months ago in May of 2019  The speculation about timing of strike on Soleimani is ridiculous  The U.S. made very clear to #Iran MONTHS AGO of what would happen if a single American was killed in one of their attacks   They chose to ignore those warnings https://t.co/i5hZHNXqYe,2020-01-04 0:30:00,Twitter for iPad,785,2295
Recent strike triggered a fresh debate in Congress about War Powers?   Why?  @potus doesn’t need approval from Congress to defend against or prevent imminent attacks against American troops.   They are acting as if he is planning an invasion of #Iran.  https://t.co/5Y4HErpiun,2020-01-04 0:17:00,Twitter for iPad,854,2909
Calling people “hawks” &amp; claims of “cheering for war” are lazy &amp; inaccurate.   Preventing imminent attacks on Americans isn’t “hawkish” it’s self defense.  And the U.S. isn’t preparing to invade #Iran. But it must &amp; will respond to &amp; if possible prevent attacks against Americans.,2020-01-03 22:17:00,Twitter for iPhone,964,4424
This wasn’t a coup prevention operation to determine governance of Iraq. Soleimani was actively plotting imminent attacks on Americans. But his coup plans are relevant because its end goal was to turn Iraq into a platform for future attacks on Americans. https://t.co/xY8VGDCvgL,2020-01-03 21:49:00,Twitter for iPhone,524,1867

1. Soleimani wasn’t “assasinated”he was killed on the battlefield during active operations.  2. He was in #Iraq in violation of a 2007 UN Security Council travel ban  3.

FICTION: Trump ordered the assasination of a foreign “General” and as a result has placed us on the brink of war.   FACT: Soleimani was an active enemy combatant more dangerous than evil men such as Bin Laden &amp; Baghdadi &amp; who operated without regard for the law of war,2020-01-03 4:35:00,Twitter for iPad,2629,8696
FICTION: Trump is desperate to start a war in the Middle East  FACT: Trump has had several opportunities to justifiably respond militarily to Iran &amp; did not. He has tried everything short of capitulation to avoid armed conflict with Iran.,2020-01-03 4:25:00,Twitter for iPad,1384,5373

The U.S. exercised economic pressure on Iran  Iran chose to respond to economic pressure with #IRGC sponsored &amp; directed attacks aimed at killing Americans  For months @POTUS has exercised tremendous restraint  These are facts &amp; any other view is either a misinformed one or a lie,2020-01-03 2:38:00,Twitter for iPad,468,1463

Therefore my decision will be based on a two pronged test:  1. Did President commit treasonbribery &amp;/or a high crime or misdemeanor as meant by Constitution;  AND  2.

The question before each Senator isn’t whether @potus did something offensivewrongimproper or even bad for the country.

A good example of how hard it will be for some in media to be fair in covering deal with #Mexico  This story opens with “Trump dropped his unpopular plan to impose tariffs after deal was reached” as if the tariffs had nothing to do with getting the deal   https://t.co/0vnZScYtQw,2019-06-08 1:19:00,Twitter for iPad,949,3547
The threat of tariffs got #Mexico to agree to take unprecedented steps to control illegal migration.  Will be very interesting to see how media covers this now.

Good to hear #Mexico wants both sides to “stay in the room” until a border deal is done. Securing their own border will go a long way.

I respect President Obrador view that migration is a basic human right. No nation admits more immigrants than we do.
