My #ProtectingJOBSAct will protect Americans from these unfair tactics by preventing agencies from threatening  licenses due to missed loan payments.  https://t.co/9QTMtg3ScG,2019-06-12 19:49:00,TweetDeck,7,12
There's been a dramatic worrisome decline in support for democracy but we must remember our democracy is essential to our #freedom &amp; #prosperity.
