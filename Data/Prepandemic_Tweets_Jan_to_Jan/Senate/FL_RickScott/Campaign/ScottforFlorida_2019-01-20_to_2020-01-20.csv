Congratulations to @SchutzJackie who was named Campaign Manager of the Year by @TheAAPC!   Jackie did an incredible job managing my campaign for U.S. Senate. Couldn’t have done it without her! https://t.co/gAXxdu5uLT,2019-04-05 03:08:08,Twitter for iPhone,34,215
Remember @SenSchumer spent $50 million to try to beat me in 2018. He failed and now he’s blocking disaster aid for my state.   They say the most dangerous place in DC is between Chuck Schumer and a TV camera. He’s playing political games for the camera while Americans suffer.,2019-04-04 17:34:10,Twitter for iPhone,5452,10390
These Democrats have no real grasp on what America is. We are a Republic. We are a federation of states.   The Founding Fathers knew what they were doing. This is just another silly idea from the Party of Silly Ideas. (2/2),2019-03-20 12:59:52,Twitter for iPhone,247,1032
Here’s the truth. Liberals like @ewarren want to get rid of the Electoral College so they only have to campaign in New York and California (the only places where their socialist policies are popular).   They see the rest of America as flyover country. (1/2) https://t.co/ZNFKzshd90,2019-03-20 12:58:46,Twitter for iPhone,766,1978

Congratulations to @lennycurry on his victory tonight!   I look forward to working with you over the next four years to keep Jacksonville moving forward. https://t.co/ARcbEkqjmG,2019-03-20 00:56:28,Twitter for iPhone,45,231
The New Left is now defending the leadership of @NicolasMaduro in #Venezuela. This is the kind of craziness that @SenSanders @AOC and @ewarren are inspiring.   RT 🔁 if you agree America will NEVER be a socialist country.   https://t.co/tpC6JzXCmw,2019-03-19 17:36:10,Twitter for iPhone,172,251
Lenny Curry has been a GREAT leader for the city of Jacksonville over the last 4 years and a strong partner in securing a safe and prosperous future for Florida families.  He has my full support! Make sure to go vote on Tuesday!   🗳✅ @lennycurry https://t.co/l9kP2ZY7lV,2019-03-16 22:11:48,Twitter for iPad,57,206
Willer Velez is a small business owner who opened the first Puerto Rican supermarket in Central Florida last year. It’s great to see young entrepreneurs pursuing the American Dream.  Congratulations on your victory! https://t.co/kt7zs4MDlP,2019-03-02 20:52:20,Twitter for iPhone,137,648
Our ad “Grandkids” was rated the Best TV Ad for a U.S. Senate Candidate by @C_and_E.   No surprise here; my grandsons always steal the show!   Watch the ad 👇 https://t.co/Fo94UbHLyp,2019-02-22 22:04:21,Twitter for iPhone,54,272
How far left has the Democrat Party gone? Presidential front-runner @BernieSanders refused to condemn @NicolasMaduro or call for him to step aside.   He’s killed tortured &amp; imprisoned his own people but Bernie Sanders stays silent. Shameful!  https://t.co/491r02wKTO,2019-02-22 01:14:50,Twitter for iPad,454,991
Here’s some wisdom from Winston Churchill. @BernieSanders could learn a thing or two.   “Socialism is the philosophy of failure the creed of ignorance and the gospel of envy.” https://t.co/qfInZgTCsr,2019-02-19 16:41:23,Twitter for iPhone,266,719
Good to have @BernieSanders running for President proving the Democrats are in a time warp. They have a cool new big idea for America – it’s called Socialism. It also happens to be the single most discredited idea from the previous century.,2019-02-19 16:02:11,Twitter for iPhone,1819,6717
.@kevinomccarthy is right. Anti-semitism is becoming far too common in today’s Democratic Party and it’s time for their leaders to stand up and say “no.”   Silence is no longer an option. https://t.co/rujA9T83FK,2019-02-09 18:53:53,Twitter for iPhone,449,1453
Democrats are right to denounce racism and call for @GovernorVA to resign. But it’s shocking how silent they were when Governor Northam embraced infanticide.   Both should be reason enough for him to resign.   https://t.co/RachtA5KdD,2019-02-02 18:45:16,Twitter for iPhone,1212,3600
Following the devastation of Hurricane Maria Rick Scott made it a priority to support Puerto Rico and welcome those coming to Florida.   According to our poll 53% of Hispanic voters said Rick Scott’s work to help Puerto Rico made them more likely to vote for him for Senate. https://t.co/1yI7ICZ38a,2019-01-27 23:04:26,Twitter for iPhone,27,88
We had success with Hispanic voters in FL because Rick Scott showed up for 8 years not just campaign season.   According to our campaign’s post-election survey of Hispanic voters 58% believe that under Rick Scott Florida became a better place for Hispanics to prosper. https://t.co/JoeJJHVqiO,2019-01-27 22:33:51,Twitter for iPhone,139,566
Here’s an idea for @BernieSanders @ewarren and all their pals promoting socialism in the United States: take a fact-finding trip to visit your buddy #Maduro in Caracas and report back on the real impacts of socialism.   I have a feeling you won’t like what you find. https://t.co/hgdGR99OK7,2019-01-23 20:26:04,Sprout Social,5091,11973
The political class in DC claims that Republicans don’t won’t and can’t perform well with Hispanic voters.   We succeeded in part because we proved them wrong. Our campaign did a post-election survey of Hispanic voters in FL. We’ll be tweeting out results over the next few days.,2019-01-22 23:04:14,Twitter for iPhone,757,3530
