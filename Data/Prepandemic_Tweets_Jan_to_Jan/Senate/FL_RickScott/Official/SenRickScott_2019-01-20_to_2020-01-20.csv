Peter Navarro is right. The national security threat posed by Chinese tech in our country is a serious concern.   I commend @Interior for grounding their Chinese made drones.

Refusing to send the impeachment articles to the Senate shows just how much House Democrats have turned this into a partisan charade.,2019-12-23 17:41:00,Twitter for iPhone,36,137
The House has the sole power of impeachment - we didn’t interfere with their 3-ring circus.

Stop playing games @SpeakerPelosi. All we want is for @realDonaldTrump to be treated like Clinton was.

This is 100% right. History shows that socialism always fails &amp; brings destruction.  The Left is promoting a socialist agenda to reverse America’s progress.

Lo único que mantiene a @NicolasMaduro en el poder es el apoyo de Cuba y el petróleo que se envía desde VZ en violación de sanciones.

Communist China’s newest form of censorship -  using students as spies to monitor their professors.  This is what China does. No dissent. No freedom of thought or expression.

Let’s be clear about what’s happening. @SenateDems don't want a solution. They want to use the plight of the VZ people as a political attack.  That’s wrong.

Una vez más los @SenateDems han decidido objetar mi enmienda para otorgarle TPS a los venezolanos y reformar el programa.  Una vez más han elegido jugar a la política en lugar de ayudar a la gente de #Venezuela.,2019-10-24 19:20:12,Twitter for iPhone,21,30
Once again @senatedems have decided to object to my Amendment to grant TPS to Venezuelans &amp; reform the program.   Once again they have chosen to play political games rather than help the people of #Venezuela. https://t.co/XcUBcV20NW,2019-10-24 19:13:58,Twitter for iPhone,44,75
Estaré una vez más presentando mi enmienda en el piso del Senado para otorgarle TPS a los venezolanos y hacerle reformas necesarias al programa.  La última vez los demócratas en el Senado bloquearon la enmienda. Espero que podamos dejar a un lado la política y hacer algo.,2019-10-24 18:40:11,Twitter for iPhone,21,40
I’m about to once again offer my Amendment on the Senate floor to grant TPS to Venezuelans &amp; make much-needed reforms to the TPS program.  Last time Senate Dems blocked it on the floor. Hopefully we can put the political games aside &amp; get something done. https://t.co/i2g75aj5nF,2019-10-24 18:39:52,Twitter for iPhone,25,68
Today’s decision to allow Communist China to host the 2021 @ClubWorldCups is anything but historic.  With this vote @FIFAcom is making it very clear it doesn't care about human rights. All this does is boost the economy of an oppressive Communist regime. https://t.co/BMf7NHGKVZ,2019-10-24 16:03:39,Twitter Web App,432,716
@NicolasMaduro Rusia continúa apoyando al régimen de @NicolasMaduro y su genocidio contra su gente. Es una amenaza de seguridad nacional para nuestro hemisferio.   Maduro sabe que no puede sobrevivir solo y depende de otras dictaduras asesinas como Rusia China y Cuba para mantener el poder.,2019-10-24 14:56:20,Twitter Web App,24,36
Russia continues to support @NicolasMaduro’s regime and his genocide on his own people. It is a national security threat to our hemisphere.  Maduro knows he cannot survive on his own and relies on other murderous dictatorships like Russia China and Cuba to hold on to power. https://t.co/iiDfEQpIBo,2019-10-24 14:55:36,Twitter Web App,51,97
Yesterday I sent a letter to @FIFAcom council member @sunilgulati urging him to reject Communist China as the host of the 2021 @ClubWorldCups.   There are countless freedom-loving countries worldwide that would be a more suitable host than one that violates human rights. https://t.co/Av2y8g785K,2019-10-24 13:45:54,Twitter Web App,525,912

On Friday the @FIFAcom Council will decide if Communist China will host the 2021 @ClubWorldCups.   I urge the US reps to vote NO. The Communist regime doesn't respect human rights &amp; shouldn't benefit from any funds resulting from the tournament.

It appears @Amazon has finally seen the light. We need to ensure the safety of products sold by online retailers.

Thank God someone is willing to speak the truth &amp; speak up against injustice. @SHAQ is absolutely right and the @NBA should learn from one of their greats.   The people of #HongKong are fighting for their human rights and the autonomy they were promised. https://t.co/AsSLqhUZK2,2019-10-23 00:36:14,Twitter for iPhone,2607,4591
Americans should be standing up for freedom &amp; human rights.  Until Communist China is ready to be a team player in the world market stop stealing our intellectual property stop militarizing the South China Sea &amp; aiding Maduro in his genocide we shouldn’t do business with them. https://t.co/hOlNjYrABy,2019-10-22 22:26:08,Twitter Web App,1184,2086

While FL students have some of the lowest student debt in the country it’s still a heavy burden.  My STEM Act provides real solutions to lower the cost of higher ed.

Han pasado más de 20 días desde que el líder de la oposición @jdanielferrer fue detenido por el opresivo régimen cubano en un intento de silenciar la libertad de expresión.

Florida’s Lehigh Acres is the #1 overall fastest-growing city in the US with several other FL cities making the top 30.

Commissioner Silver just now on @ESPN said that @NBA players were “put in a difficult position.”   No it’s not difficult. You either stand up for human rights or you don’t.

Communist China’s oppressive system is built on violating human rights and human dignity.   The more that countries do business with China the more support they gain. It’s time for Americans to #BuyAmerican. https://t.co/OgheeChL4G,2019-10-20 15:06:53,Twitter for iPhone,973,1532
Communist China not only denies human rights to their people but is also responsible for the worlds worst polluted air.  They say they're trying to crack down on pollution but ramp up the use of greenhouse gases.
