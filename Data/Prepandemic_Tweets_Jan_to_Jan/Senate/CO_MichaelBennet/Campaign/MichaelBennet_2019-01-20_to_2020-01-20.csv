The Real Deal — my agenda to rebuild the middle class expand opportunity &amp; tackle generational challenges like climate change — would cost $6 trillion over the next decade.

The most important thing we must establish is the nature of the threat that @realDonaldTrump was responding to when he killed Soleimani. Trump claims it was imminent.

@realDonaldTrump Trump said his tax bill would raise wages by at least an average of $4000 per worker. That did not happen. He was either lying or didn’t know what was in his own bill (probably both).  We can reward hard work if we want to. Here’s how: https://t.co/vJSruzDOgu,2020-01-06 18:43:12,Twitter Web App,10,29
.@realDonaldTrump likes to brag about job numbers. But the pace of hiring was faster under the last two years of President Obama.

The President has made it very difficult for Congress to do the oversight that the Constitution requires and that the American people demand. He’s obstructed and stonewalled at every step of the way and today’s announcement reflects that. 2/3,2019-12-10 17:31:50,Twitter for iPhone,10,38
We have to follow due process and the rule of law but if the evidence of the President’s wrongdoing and abuse of power continues to remain consistent with what we’ve seen it’s likely I will vote to impeach. 1/3 https://t.co/u2Wrzes2pF,2019-12-10 17:31:21,Twitter for iPhone,23,113
Important point made today by @FamilyEconomyNH: Everybody is 1 of 4 types of caregivers. Those who are caregivers those who have been those who will be and those who need care.   We must pass paid family &amp; medical leave—and it will be a priority in a Bennet Administration.,2019-12-10 16:22:33,Twitter for iPhone,5,12
This lack of mobility is why I’m running for president. We have to create opportunity again.

If I had to summarize my last 10 years of town halls it’s that people are working hard but can’t afford some combination of health care housing child care &amp; higher education—in other words they can’t afford a middle-class life. Families can’t afford another 10 years like this.,2019-12-10 16:05:29,Twitter for iPhone,3,20
A powerful discussion on the importance of paid family &amp; medical leave protections against discrimination in the workforce and helping families when they hit hard times.

Instead of spending 10 years fighting about Medicare for All let's achieve universal coverage in 3 years with my Medicare-X public option plan &amp; then pass the American Family Act my bill with @SherrodBrown that costs 3% of Medicare for All &amp; would cut childhood poverty by 40%.,2019-10-15 16:57:46,Twitter Web Client,16,61
No one would question @SherrodBrown's progressive credentials or his commitment to protecting the interests of all Americans – and even he understands the political catastrophe Medicare for All represents in swing states like Ohio where Democrats need a broad coalition to win. https://t.co/SMRyox5qVj,2019-10-15 16:08:52,Twitter Web Client,35,101

We could cut child poverty by 40% with one simple change to the tax code.

We have to stitch this country back together. We need a president who will spend as much time in places they didn’t win as those they did to build a constituency for change.

Now U.S. troops are being shelled by a member of NATO our allies are being killed and driven into the arms of Assad and Putin and ISIS supporters are escaping.,2019-10-14 14:01:46,Twitter for iPhone,11,38

This isn't what you do when you had a "perfect phone call." It's what you do when you're covering something up.  It's no surprise the president has declared war on this investigation.

If we're on offense on healthcare in '20 just like in '18 we'll win. But if we run on eliminating Medicare Advantage for 20 million seniors it makes Trump’s job easier. Just this week he claimed to be the defender of Medicare. Let’s not give away the upper hand on healthcare.,2019-10-04 22:05:14,Twitter Web Client,12,37
We need to win back the nine million Obama-Trump voters to take the White House and Senate and keep the House. Medicare for All is not a recipe to do that. There’s a reason you don’t see Democrats up for reelection in tough districts running on Medicare for All.,2019-10-04 22:05:14,Twitter Web Client,12,48
Candidates in competitive districts need a nominee at the top of the ticket with an agenda that will help them win.

Caregiving is the most meaningful work a parent can do but for some reason we’ve made it harder and harder.  That's why my American Family Act puts more money in the pockets of families including stay-at-home parents.  https://t.co/DZCsjrjQz7,2019-10-04 12:06:09,Twitter Web Client,22,93

We have two paths as a party.  We can be on offense on health care or we can be on defense.  When we’re protecting and building on the Affordable Care Act we win. That’s the path we should choose—not taking away health care with Medicare for All. https://t.co/J3nRI9OO5F,2019-09-27 21:40:40,Twitter Media Studio,19,126

Over the past 10 years the forces of money in politics partisan gerrymandering &amp; voter suppression have combined to separate the people from their government. On my first day as president I will prioritize getting money out of politics &amp; bringing the American people back in. https://t.co/7BAxy22Jox,2019-09-26 21:35:58,Twitter Web Client,16,50
Citizens United has created a corruption of inaction that we must overcome to tackle the existential threat that is climate change and take the urgent action we desperately need. https://t.co/vGFIWWUCO3,2019-09-26 21:02:36,Twitter Media Studio,27,167

We can’t spend 10 more years fighting over Medicare for All. We need to get to universal coverage now and then tackle the other challenges our nation faces — from climate change to economic inequality. https://t.co/HIYsacHJrP,2019-09-26 00:42:08,Twitter Media Studio,38,184
To date Biden Klobuchar O’Rourke and Buttigieg have embraced a plan that is essentially the Medicare-X plan I wrote in the Senate years ago. If we want to beat Trump and achieve universal coverage Warren and Sanders need to do the same and reject Medicare for All.,2019-09-25 18:57:10,Twitter Web Client,23,181
A public option is the best way to cover everyone and lower costs which is why I've championed it for 10 years.   I'm glad to see @PeteButtigieg has come down on the right side of the fence he's been straddling during this campaign in his latest ad.,2019-09-25 18:56:14,Twitter Web Client,34,331

To me one of the great injustices in this country is that our education system is reinforcing income inequality not liberating kids from it.   Your zip code or your parents’ income should not determine the quality of your school. #YouthVoice,2019-09-22 15:06:19,Twitter for iPhone,36,200
Washington in so many ways is corrupt and not responsive to the American people.   We need to send people to Washington who are responsive to voters not to special interests.

Since the day he stepped into the Oval Office @realDonaldTrump has attacked science ignored facts &amp; undermined actions to protect our climate.   As President I'll rollback his anti-climate policies. Even now I have a bill with 30 cosponsors to do just that. #ClimateForum2020,2019-09-19 16:40:41,Twitter Web Client,14,41

Trump McConnell &amp; Koch brothers have blocked all climate action. To overcome them we need to win in 2020—not just the White House but up &amp; down the ballot. That means we need a climate plan that expands the coalition of people who are invested in this fight. #ClimateForum2020,2019-09-19 14:28:27,Twitter Web Client,5,20
I’m with @GretaThunberg — there can be no compromise on the science.   And if we don’t take action on climate change now the next generation won’t have a chance to. Our kids are expecting their elected officials to do their jobs. #ClimateForum2020,2019-09-19 14:23:03,Twitter Web Client,4,31
That means we’re going to need to bring unlikely voices like those of farmers and ranchers to the table so we can build a broad coalition for change. That’s how we will craft and implement a solution to the climate crisis that can endure. #ClimateForum2020,2019-09-19 14:21:29,Twitter Web Client,3,19
We absolutely need an urgent answer to climate change. But just as important we need a solution that will endure a generation. You can’t solve climate change if the policies you put in place will be ripped out by the next administration. #ClimateForum2020,2019-09-19 14:19:02,Twitter Web Client,8,24

We need a president who knows where they stand. I've been fighting for a public option to get to universal coverage since 2009.

FACT CHECK: 70% of Americans like the insurance they already have: https://t.co/FJQBiKRRwF  We can get to universal health care without banning the employer union and Medicare Advantage plans millions have now.

If we want to achieve universal health care and defeat Trump we must put forth a healthcare plan that unites the country.

The American people are furious. And so am I.  40 years of no economic mobility for 90% of the people.  An education system that reinforces inequality.  Trump erasing Obama's leadership on climate change.  No response on mass shootings.  We can change that by winning in 2020. https://t.co/wgAvz44pQ6,2019-06-27 18:39:19,Twitter Media Studio,31,125

A is for Appointment. I was appointed to the Senate in 2009 and started with just 3% name recognition.

The agenda in Washington these days has nothing to do with the kids in my former school district—nothing to do with the priorities of American families. That’s why the work of @UniteThePoor is so important. We must demand better. #PPCMoralCongress,2019-06-17 21:05:38,Twitter for iPhone,7,18

Marshall’s lifetime of service was capped by 24 years on the Supreme Court.

After Briggs was combined with other school desegregation cases Marshall led the effort against segregated schools at the Supreme Court.

In 1942 while working for the @NAACP_LDF Thurgood Marshall went to Charleston SC to fight for equal pay for black teachers; he won the case in 1944. In 1949 he returned to SC to fight segregation leading the plaintiffs in Briggs v. Elliot. 2/4,2019-06-14 01:26:13,Twitter Web Client,12,28

Another throwback this time to 2016. When lawmakers become lobbyists the American people think they went to Washington just to get rich. We need to change that reality and focus on serving the public. https://t.co/X3Sam2BxzQ,2019-06-01 18:02:02,Twitter Web Client,20,59

Health care decisions should be in the hands of women and their families. Period. https://t.co/w1o0Z1CW5K,2019-05-15 16:34:04,Twitter Web Client,31,115
We overcame $17 million in attacks to win the closest Senate race in 2010.  And we did it the old-fashioned way: going everywhere talking to everyone and standing up for policies like Obamacare across a purple state.  Let’s do it again.

The Senate is broken. And it didn’t happen by accident.   @senatemajldr Mitch McConnell lived up to being the “guardian of gridlock” breaking the Senate for partisan gain. History will remember the deep damage McConnell inflicted on our republic. https://t.co/LGi7CJdPj1,2019-05-14 21:14:56,Twitter Web Client,185,528
Health care housing child care and education costs are way up.  Wages for too many Americans are flat.  This is the economic challenge of our time.   That’s why I have plans to create a #MedicareX public option and expand the Child Tax Credit. → https://t.co/OP1qrohYSE,2019-05-14 19:57:52,Twitter Web Client,10,33
Instead of shrugging off this self-inflicted trade war @realDonaldTrump should face the farmers and ranchers across the country whose livelihoods are on the line because of his reckless policies. I bet they’d say there’s nothing “little” about this. https://t.co/GO2IQaqDYM,2019-05-14 18:25:50,Twitter Web Client,20,59
Speaking the truth matters. We won in the 2010 Tea Party wave while defending Obamacare in rural areas.  Outside groups spent millions against us but grassroots power prevailed. Together we’ll win in 2020. Join us ➡️ https://t.co/GskH5ANtvq https://t.co/YRgglpdEqH,2019-05-14 16:35:31,Twitter Media Studio,7,27

Spent the morning with my daughter Caroline and some fantastic radio hosts on the site where the Consitution was ratified in Concord NH. Later a school was built here and this door is full of signatures from teachers and radio guests. https://t.co/4t8sw71s4L,2019-05-13 16:14:18,Twitter for iPhone,5,39
Donald Trump is the most fiscally irresponsible president in decades.  Now his tariffs on China are imposing taxes on American farmers workers and consumers. And I can assure you China has a longer attention span than Donald Trump does. https://t.co/ed9LKMGI8E,2019-05-13 16:10:37,Twitter Media Studio,51,206
Great conversation on @1077ThePulse and @1073WEMJ for my final stop in New Hampshire this weekend. Peter and Pat — I’ll be back! https://t.co/6ihJrLdmaR,2019-05-13 13:48:14,Twitter for iPhone,3,16
Thank you @taramadison and @983LNH for having me on this morning’s show. Talked about everything from my favorite pizza (pepperoni) to why I’m in NH and running for President. Hope to see you again soon. https://t.co/dJB4iZBX4A,2019-05-13 13:42:44,Twitter for iPhone,3,25
Our campaign is about leveling with the American people. Together we can restore integrity to Washington. And it starts with reforms like banning members of Congress from ever becoming lobbyists.

Another great house party in the books in New Hampshire! It’s incredible to see the thought and seriousness with which everyone takes their responsibility to elect our nominee for president. I’m humbled to be part of it. https://t.co/nClPLcEbEQ,2019-05-13 02:05:16,Twitter for iPhone,5,44
Tonight we’re talking about the next generation. Granite Staters want to know what we’re going to do about climate change education and the national debt. We cannot burden our kids by not solving these critical problems. https://t.co/hocg9jCzzn,2019-05-13 00:39:15,Twitter for iPhone,5,35
To my mom America is a beacon of opportunity — where she could rebuild her life after the Holocaust enroll herself in school &amp; become a librarian. She gave us more chances than she ever had &amp; taught us that our job is to extend opportunity so others can rise. #HappyMothersDay https://t.co/XpMGjv0qUQ,2019-05-12 19:38:00,Twitter for iPhone,20,199
No visit to Ottumwa is complete without a stop at the Canteen! Sat next to a man who’s been coming here since high school for burgers and malts. They’ve been serving Iowans for nearly a century—and now I see why. https://t.co/KFdgVQ0qT9,2019-05-12 02:47:26,Twitter for iPhone,9,43

Great conversation in Pella today. We talked at length about the importance of facts and the need for a president who is willing to level with people. There’s no other way we’re going to solve our greatest challenges if we don’t start there. https://t.co/7bUl2fiM5K,2019-05-11 19:29:25,Twitter for iPhone,7,25
