If a foreign government offers a candidate election help it’s not for free. They expect something in return. They expect you to place their interests ahead of your country’s interests. It’s un-American to entertain such an offer let alone accept it.,2019-06-13 13:07:12,TweetDeck,371,967

Facts must still matter. Even if one thinks it’s OK to gerrymander districts to advantage one particular political party—and I certainly do not no matter the party—this administration should never be able to validate such actions with a blatant lie.,2019-06-06 21:03:32,Twitter Web Client,20,84
There is a reason why ALL THREE FEDERAL JUDGES who have considered this issue found that the Trump admin offered no legitimate rationale to support adding the question and it would depress response rates IN VIOLATION OF THE LAW.  https://t.co/paHM8Q4U0Y,2019-06-06 21:03:31,Twitter Web Client,56,119
In the next two weeks SCOTUS will decide whether to accept the Trump admin’s ludicrous pretext at face value. Doing so in the face of such overwhelming evidence of their true motivations would do lasting damage to the credibility of the Court not to mention to minority voters.,2019-06-06 21:03:31,Twitter Web Client,5,23
The Trump admin’s stated rationale that adding a citizenship question would help to protect minority voting rights is not only wrong it is the EXACT OPPOSITE OF WHAT THEY KNEW WOULD HAPPEN. https://t.co/NKXfGWnbGf,2019-06-06 21:03:31,Twitter Web Client,7,23
The operative’s fingerprints were all over the partisan push to add a citizenship question. A paragraph he wrote providing the Voting Rights Act pretext was included VERBATIM in a letter that Commerce proposed DOJ send back to Commerce as justification. https://t.co/Hoc9j1ADGP,2019-06-06 21:03:30,Twitter Web Client,3,18
The operative—a partisan gerrymandering expert—not only provided the Trump admin with the true motivation behind adding the question he also helped CONCOCT THE PRETEXT: He helped “ghostwrite” a draft DOJ letter requesting the question be added. https://t.co/QMgWMDmgGe,2019-06-06 21:03:30,Twitter Web Client,5,19
The Trump admin absurdly claims adding the question would actually help minorities.   Yet new evidence from the census litigation reveals the effort was at the behest of a Republican operative who explicitly claimed “REPUBLICANS AND NON-HISPANIC WHITES” would benefit politically. https://t.co/UpzAoL6aTM,2019-06-06 21:03:29,Twitter Web Client,7,21
Fast forward to today: The Justice and Commerce Depts have either stonewalled or dragged their feet in the face of congressional attempts to get answers.

Then last April in a profile in courage Ross skipped his annual Appropriations oversight hearing before I could question him about his false testimony. Here’s what I had to say about that then: https://t.co/ArifmU9ylq,2019-06-06 21:03:28,Twitter Web Client,7,19
And he did so at the urging of none other than voter-suppression guru Kris Kobach. Here’s a thread laying out the evidence: https://t.co/3NyEZXiOlU,2019-06-06 21:03:28,Twitter Web Client,6,20
We’ve since learned Ross’s testimony was BLATANTLY FALSE. It earned him 4 Pinocchios. Ross began pushing DOJ to “request” the question in early 2017.,2019-06-06 21:03:27,Twitter Web Client,6,24
When I asked Sec. Wilbur Ross about the question’s origins in May 2018 he testified DOJ was “the one” who made the initial request. https://t.co/AId89esTMN,2019-06-06 21:03:26,Twitter Web Client,6,17

Thanks to these emails we now know Ross’s testimony was false. As I said on the Senate Floor this week Ross is not an investment banker anymore. He must answer to Congress &amp; the American people. Hiding will not solve his problems. The truth has a way of catching up.,2019-04-04 15:21:41,Twitter Web Client,31,135
Here’s an email to Ross from his staff detailing how DOJ “DID NOT WANT TO RAISE THE QUESTION” of citizenship given the controversies DOJ was already handling. That certainly doesn’t sound like Commerce “was responding solely to [DOJ’s] request” as Ross testified. https://t.co/HIDcQcE8Wa,2019-04-04 15:21:41,Twitter Web Client,17,65
Here is Ross ready to call AG Sessions to pressure DOJ to support including the citizenship question. https://t.co/FPcZLiAdum,2019-04-04 15:21:40,Twitter Web Client,8,45

And here is Ross receiving an email again almost a year before his testimony from Kris Kobach—an architect of VOTER SUPPRESSION efforts—detailing a call they had had “months earlier” on the importance of including the question for determining representation in Congress. https://t.co/9BrCY1bGwL,2019-04-04 15:21:39,Twitter Web Client,14,48
But thanks to a FOIA lawsuit we now know that almost one year before he testified before me Ross emailed his staff claiming he was “mystified why nothing had been done in response to my months old request that we include the citizenship question.” https://t.co/zh1vKboaFj,2019-04-04 15:21:39,Twitter Web Client,17,51
