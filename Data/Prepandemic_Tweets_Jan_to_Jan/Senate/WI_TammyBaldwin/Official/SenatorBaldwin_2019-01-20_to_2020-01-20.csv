Two years ago President Trump said he supported my legislation that requires a permanent #BuyAmerica standard for rebuilding our water infrastructure but he has failed to deliver on his promise. https://t.co/LYiXo8A19T,2019-01-31 16:28:05,Twitter Web Client,22,34
The latest Executive Order from @POTUS is weak toothless and more proof he is a phony on #BuyAmerica.   American manufacturers and workers deserve a permanent #BuyAmerica commitment from Washington that rewards their hard work.,2019-01-31 16:28:05,Twitter Web Client,38,96
The least we can do is level the playing field and give women a fair shot at getting ahead because they deserve equal pay for equal work. #PaycheckFairness #EqualPay https://t.co/LSeoiWFn5x,2019-01-30 19:38:53,Twitter Web Client,7,31
Many women are working full-time and many are working two jobs to make ends meet yet far too many are barely getting by and far too many women and children are living in poverty. We need to pass the #PaycheckFairness Act and do right by working women. https://t.co/XlOztk40aq,2019-01-30 19:38:53,Twitter Web Client,15,45
Working women make up over 50 percent of our workforce. They are working harder than ever to get ahead and they deserve to get ahead. #PaycheckFairness #EqualPay https://t.co/donAmXpcGZ,2019-01-30 19:32:51,Twitter Web Client,13,37
There is paycheck inequality for hard working American women across this country and it is time we do something about it. Congress should vote to pass the #PaycheckFairness Act https://t.co/hl37Z0DQpa,2019-01-30 19:32:51,Twitter Web Client,22,56
President Trump Scott Walker and Foxconn made promises to Wisconsin workers and taxpayers.  Foxconn cannot be allowed to fall short of keeping their promises or break them. https://t.co/aw6wxzb4pj,2019-01-30 18:34:42,TweetDeck,218,638
This is long overdue justice for our veterans. Now it is up to @SecWilkie to do the right thing and let this decision stand. Our #BlueWaterNavy veterans have waited long enough.  https://t.co/AdwiC9VKYQ,2019-01-30 17:43:53,TweetDeck,15,30
If my good friend @RepGwenMoore can beat cancer yes we can stand up against those who want to take people's health care away.  Yes we can win our fight to protect people’s health care.

It’s only fair that if the federal government can charge you interest for being late on your taxes then it should be paying interest on late paychecks to workers.  I’m calling on @SenateMajLdr to bring the Back Pay Fairness Act to the floor for a vote. https://t.co/9iq4Sf4dJK,2019-01-29 20:15:00,Twitter Media Studio,62,197
Mr. President global climate change or as you call it “global waming” hasn’t gone anywhere. Please log off twitter &amp; take the time to understand this real and growing threat to national security public health and our economy in the beautiful Midwest. https://t.co/OOdAFhPfiT https://t.co/3XHDGytlxG,2019-01-29 18:36:17,Twitter Web Client,338,1261
That’s why I’m joining @SenTinaSmith on her Fair Compensation for Low-Wage Contractor Employees Act and calling for a vote so we can make sure our federal contractor employees get the paychecks they need. https://t.co/amD3plOSgw,2019-01-29 17:45:42,Twitter Web Client,16,40
The #TrumpShutdown accomplished nothing and hurt a lot of people including federal contractor employees who were furloughed or forced to accept reduced work hours. We need to make sure these contractors who missed their paychecks are paid back.,2019-01-29 17:45:42,Twitter Web Client,17,62
Federal workers went without pay for over month because of the #TrumpShutdown.  The Trump Administration must immediately act to make sure these workers get paid.  No delays. Now. https://t.co/Eez4xo3eeK,2019-01-29 16:18:42,TweetDeck,126,346
I have always opposed BDS activities and will continue to do so. I support security aid to Israel and Syria sanctions but #S1 overturns 50 years of bipartisan US policy and threatens a peaceful two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.,2019-01-28 22:58:09,TweetDeck,34,129
I’m calling for a Senate vote on the Back Pay Fairness Act.   Federal workers haven’t been paid in over a month.  They should receive their full back-pay plus any interest accrued. https://t.co/Q2pWuf5ohc,2019-01-28 17:37:20,TweetDeck,255,1061
As heavy snow and dangerously cold weather conditions spread throughout #WI please use extra caution when deciding to head outdoors today. Make sure to familiarize yourself with weather safety tips and stay safe! https://t.co/8GPks3qHGH,2019-01-28 17:06:16,TweetDeck,13,48
My thoughts are also with the survivors. My JUST Act was signed into law last year to take an important step toward securing justice for Holocaust survivors and families of victims. #NeverAgain,2019-01-27 16:58:59,Twitter Web Client,14,32

President Trump's shutdown accomplished nothing and has hurt a lot of people. Now that he has agreed to end it we can open the government make sure workers get a paycheck and work together on bipartisan reform to fund border security and fix our broken immigration system.,2019-01-25 20:00:21,Twitter Web Client,83,341
Wisconsin Coast Guard workers are risking their lives and doing their job without pay during the #TrumpShutdown.  This is a disgrace. We should be doing everything we can to support our Coast Guard service members and their families.   We need to #EndTheShutdownNow. https://t.co/XIwtUvIC2N,2019-01-25 18:19:41,Twitter Web Client,58,161
The Earned Income Tax Credit rewards hard work &amp; helps grow our economy.

These are serious grand jury indictments against a longtime advisor to President Trump.    There is a pattern of people close to the President lying to Congress and investigators.

“For us it’s going to be close to a $20000 revenue that we’re not going to be able to make up later when and if the government opens... this debate shouldn’t have a financial burden on small businesses their employees &amp; their families.” https://t.co/LqRkGuawAe,2019-01-25 00:45:00,TweetDeck,28,84

Today in the Senate I voted with Democrats and Republicans for bipartisan legislation that has passed the House to end the #TrumpShutdown fund the government and make sure workers get their paychecks. We must work together to #EndTheShutdownNow.,2019-01-24 21:38:24,TweetDeck,29,185
Just one reason why I will not support Andrew Wheeler’s nomination.   We need leadership at the EPA to take on polluters confront climate change and protect our environment. https://t.co/OMhPTzLTyd,2019-01-24 17:27:34,TweetDeck,74,178

I support a Senate vote on bipartisan legislation passed by the House to #EndTheShutdownNow. The Senate should pass it and President Trump should sign it to reopen the government.,2019-01-23 17:23:21,Twitter Web Client,32,108

Federal workers have to take odd jobs to make ends meet during the #TrumpShutdown. That’s not right. There’s common ground to simply #EndTheShutdownNow by voting to open the government &amp; make sure workers get paid.

President Trump’s ban on patriotic qualified Americans who want to serve our country is wrong and this SCOTUS decision shows how far we have to go to achieve full equality for everyone.
