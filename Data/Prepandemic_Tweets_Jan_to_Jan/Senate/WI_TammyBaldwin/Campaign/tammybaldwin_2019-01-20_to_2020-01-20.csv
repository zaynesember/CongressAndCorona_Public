President Trump will be in MKE tonight while the Dem candidates are debating. Today I joined @HallieJackson to discuss the clear choice for voters. Democrats want to protect coverage for preexisting conditions while President Trump wants to take them away. https://t.co/RheooZ2wAS,2020-01-14 20:44:41,Twitter for iPhone,8,25
The American people want a fair and honest trial! https://t.co/5ILJN3w1ot,2020-01-14 01:16:39,Twitter for iPhone,9,73
A right-wing group is trying to make it harder for people in Wisconsin to vote. We must continue to organize and register people to vote to make sure that everyone can make their voices heard at the ballot box. https://t.co/YnF4CUSHSD,2019-12-18 23:07:14,Twitter for iPhone,147,415
@TriciaforWI will be a big voice for Wisconsin in the House! https://t.co/w7lwhL0r4u,2019-11-13 17:13:02,Twitter for iPhone,66,147

Thank you @blocbyblocMKE for welcoming me to your office today and talking about the important work you are doing in Milwaukee! https://t.co/bZgdaiJ1kE,2019-09-13 23:09:58,Twitter for iPhone,10,40
Wisconsin farmers have been affected by the on-going trade wars. Our state has lost over 1600 farms since President Trump took office. We must protect them.  https://t.co/IKtlXtaqTN,2019-08-22 19:54:47,Twitter for iPhone,27,50
Taking back the Senate in 2020 is critical. It’s great to see @Hickenlooper join the Senate race in Colorado to help make sure Mitch McConnell is no longer the Majority Leader. https://t.co/FJuhcTIDnp,2019-08-22 14:44:34,Twitter for iPhone,15,93
Thank you Monroe County Democrats for hosting me last night in Sparta and for all your hard work during the campaign! https://t.co/Tc58uLxcfE,2019-08-21 17:57:05,Twitter for iPhone,2,20
I always ask people to engage to stay active to be advocates to speak out to be visible on issues and to not give up on our democracy. https://t.co/VqIGnFjpZs,2019-08-21 15:00:44,Twitter for iPhone,6,11
I will continue to stand with retirees and workers in our fight because they should be able to count on the pensions they have earned. They will not stop until the job is done and I will not stop until the job is done to keep this promise. https://t.co/q7WL4HNBm9,2019-08-09 17:27:55,Twitter for iPhone,10,16
A picture perfect night to catch up with friends and supporters in Minocqua tonight! https://t.co/5llgfEkbUG,2019-08-06 23:00:54,Twitter for iPhone,1,35
On Sunday I stopped by the @WaupacaDemocrat annual picnic to thank them for all their hard work during the campaign and talk about our plans to win in Wisconsin next November! https://t.co/UKeG7bcUn5,2019-08-06 13:55:59,Twitter for iPhone,2,17
These are absolutely essential initiatives to the greatest freshwater source in the world.  https://t.co/XcGZroJ55o,2019-08-02 17:06:17,Twitter for iPhone,12,38
The path to the White House runs through the Midwest. In 2018 we showed that Democrats can win in places like WI. Here is my advice to the Presidential candidates on how to do it again in 2020!    https://t.co/X9KGJqGoCh,2019-07-30 16:25:08,Twitter for iPhone,12,51
The broken promises go beyond jobs. President Trump promised he would lower health care costs. But we’re finding that co-pays prescription drug prices and many other health care costs have all increased on his watch. https://t.co/9MJBLvuR8k,2019-07-26 15:29:04,Twitter for iPhone,9,24
Too many Wisconsinites have lost their jobs because of unregulated private equity firms. My new legislation will crack down on these predatory practices and protect workers. https://t.co/jtbM9dRhqt,2019-07-22 18:20:27,Twitter for iPhone,11,29
I met with former Shopko workers this past weekend to hear about their struggles. Workers need to have as powerful as a voice in the United States Senate as do private equity funds and their teams of lobbyists. https://t.co/Mtse2K2rr4,2019-07-15 17:53:28,Twitter for iPhone,6,26
Baldwin: More must be done to preserve ObamaCare https://t.co/gz08E3CVYR,2019-07-11 17:42:03,Twitter for iPhone,6,28
Once again President Trump is trying gut Obamacare and take protections away from people with preexisting conditions. We should be expanding access to health care not taking it away. #ProtectOurCare                    https://t.co/e1aVOC9SwR,2019-07-09 16:36:34,Twitter for iPhone,10,23
In 2020 we need to do more than win back the White House we must also flip the Senate. What better place to start than in Kentucky! https://t.co/Nhs7exGUgv,2019-07-09 13:52:05,Twitter for iPhone,35,175

Congress must not allow this administration to repeat the mistakes of the past. We have a constitutional responsibility to prevent the President from going to war and sending our American troops into harm’s way without congressional authorization. https://t.co/9DMOJg14Od,2019-06-29 12:18:52,Twitter for iPhone,16,49
“When we look back at the Stonewall uprising and activism that grew out of that moment even the most basic progress seemed like it would take a revolution to achieve. So we had one.” #Stonewall50 #Pride2019   https://t.co/8qtvSkrcfk,2019-06-28 16:27:24,Twitter for iPhone,11,44
Yesterday my bipartisan bill The Fair Drug Pricing Act passed through committee. This is an important step to holding #BigPharma accountable for skyrocketing drug costs. https://t.co/8a46lVctyA,2019-06-27 15:52:26,Twitter for iPhone,7,36
President Trump is once again trying to undermine the Affordable Care Act. I was in La Crosse this weekend to talk about my efforts to protect people with preexisting conditions.  https://t.co/29bw3hh84h,2019-04-29 16:34:24,Twitter for iPhone,29,59
Excited to be with @Tip4WI this afternoon in Kenosha talking to volunteers before they go knock on doors. If you live in the 64th AD don’t forget to vote on Tuesday! https://t.co/JHfBRmO12w,2019-04-27 19:32:29,Twitter for iPhone,16,62

Outside special interests spent millions trying to defeat me. Together we fought back and won. Now we must pass meaningful laws to stop these groups from trying to rig the system.  #ForThePeople Act  https://t.co/BVpscbmwJm,2019-04-07 17:56:21,Twitter for iPhone,29,72

We have come such a long way! We still have strides to make in battling discrimination for every single LGBTQ American but I'm glad that there are a lot more leaders in that fight!  https://t.co/KGwzjRQkEX,2019-04-05 19:42:52,Twitter Web App,13,76

When I was first elected to the Senate I said that I didn't run to make history I ran to make a difference. We need more people who will step up and run for office to make a difference in their communities and make some history too! https://t.co/fs29NCIpjp,2019-04-02 23:03:19,Twitter Web App,44,283
President Trump has just assured us that the issue in 2020 will be health care.  https://t.co/lP5JMCcyqh via @msnbc,2019-03-28 19:35:45,Twitter Web Client,15,54
Fair. Impartial. Independent. And most of all a fantastic public servant. I could go on but you get the idea. Let's send @JudgeNeubauer to the Wisconsin Supreme Court--VOTE on April 2nd! https://t.co/lqRLFYegrE,2019-03-28 16:02:11,Twitter Web App,40,82

It's hard to overstate @laningforwi's impact on Wisconsin politics and I'm so proud to have worked with her to help turn Wisconsin a lot bluer last November.   I wish her all the best as she finds the next great thing. — TB https://t.co/JWmyxtLjWy,2019-02-06 21:31:35,Twitter for iPhone,16,65
Guys there's no need to fight.  All you have to do is stop obstructing plans to reopen the government...  https://t.co/DfOcDPu4PY,2019-01-25 19:18:27,Twitter for iPhone,36,166
Wow appreciate the enthusiasm! But your money may be better served supporting these organizations helping furloughed workers:  https://t.co/hb20g1xp2l  https://t.co/OJKRgwWdWf  Okay now Tammy and I are going to get back to work — we've got a government to reopen. https://t.co/s7COmbkOTW,2019-01-25 02:23:06,Twitter for iPhone,26,229
