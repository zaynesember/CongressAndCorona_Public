Research has shown that due to algorithmic bias well-meaning advertisers can unintentionally create discriminatory ads. And malicious advertisers can accurately target blacks Latinos women the elderly and LGBTQ members for exclusion from housing employment and credit.,2019-04-10 19:45:02,Twitter Web Client,10,26

The discrimination my family faced in 1969 is much harder to detect in 2019: houses that you never know are for sale job opportunities that never present themselves and financing that you never become aware of—all due to biased algorithms.,2019-04-10 19:43:16,Twitter Web Client,13,30
