At last night’s #DemDebate I looked into the audience &amp; saw John Lewis—a man whose activism changed my life.

This week more of our kids will head back to school to learn how to shelter in place to hide from active shooters—it’s an absurd reality &amp; not normal.

Addressing white supremacy is an act of national security—we need to take this growing threat seriously. Right-wing extremists have carried out most of the terror attacks here since 9/11—and the majority of those were white supremacists.

It’s absurd that we live in a nation where someone who was convicted of stalking their girlfriend can still go out &amp; buy a gun.

We need to change our gun laws. https://t.co/fZZQkgHTGl,2019-08-29 14:27:36,Twitter Media Studio,562,2995
64 years ago Emmett Till was brutally murdered by white supremacists. He was 14.  Today hate crimes are on the rise. We must confront this in our laws &amp; through more moral leadership.

It’s not enough to simply decriminalize marijuana—we must repair the damage done to those communities that have been most harmed by the failed War on Drugs &amp; we must expunge the records of those who have served their time.

As president I won’t wait to take on the epidemic of gun violence in our country. On Day One I will: ✅ Keep guns out of the wrong hands with gun licensing ✅ Hold gun manufacturers accountable ✅ Bring the fight to the NRA https://t.co/si7MK2cQZD,2019-08-19 15:39:17,Twitter Web App,109,521

Why do you think Russians and Republicans are doing everything they can to subvert African American votes?

A promise: as president I will never conduct foreign policy by tweet. #DemDebate,2019-08-01 02:18:21,TweetDeck,823,9312
This is one of those times where we’re not staring at the truth and calling it out: In 2016 everyone from Republicans to Russians was trying to suppress African American voters. In 2020 we have to turn out Black voters especially Black women. #DemDebate,2019-08-01 02:01:13,TweetDeck,434,1911
Nobody should get applause for supporting the Paris Climate Agreement—that’s kindergarten stuff.  We should use every lever of our diplomatic and economic might to accelerate global progress. https://t.co/2WJJTLe28z #DemDebate,2019-08-01 01:52:18,TweetDeck,167,1023

Our justice system is deeply broken—it treats you better if you’re rich and guilty than poor and innocent. We need bold comprehensive reform and we need it now: https://t.co/TddNanXnbh #DemDebate,2019-08-01 01:20:29,TweetDeck,176,660
We have a mass incarceration crisis in this country because we’ve tried to solve addiction mental health and poverty by locking people up not by lifting people up. #DemDebate,2019-08-01 01:14:33,TweetDeck,472,2334
Republicans want to pit some immigrants against others. But we need to reform this whole immigration system and begin to be the country that says “Everyone has worth and dignity and this should be a country that honors everyone.” #DemDebate https://t.co/rFV9NgAZus,2019-08-01 01:14:23,Twitter Media Studio,245,958

The person enjoying this debate the most is Donald Trump. As we pick each other apart Republicans are trying to gut Obamacare. #DemDebate,2019-08-01 00:38:32,TweetDeck,1209,7052

We know who Donald Trump is. But this election isn’t about him—it’s about who we are. We have serious problems in this country—but we are a people who desperately want to heal and move forward to unite in common purpose. That’s how we’ll beat him. 2/2,2019-08-01 00:26:53,TweetDeck,175,1074
Last week President Trump invoked age-old language that demagogues racists and fear-mongerers have used before in our history to try and divide our country against itself by calling an American city "a disgusting rat and rodent infested mess.” 1/2,2019-08-01 00:26:20,TweetDeck,164,1066
We will beat Donald Trump not by fighting on his terms but by rising above his hate. Tune in to CNN now to hear my vision for building a more fair just country for everyone: https://t.co/3yxdmGXSqz #DemDebate,2019-07-31 23:56:29,TweetDeck,84,360

My dad’s community believed in him and paid for his college education—many children born into poverty don’t get that chance. My baby bonds plan empowers more kids to change the trajectory of their lives while closing the wealth gap—and virtually eliminating the racial wealth gap. https://t.co/8t77B5So3N,2019-07-30 23:37:09,Twitter Web App,108,553
In many states there are laws preventing an abusive spouse from purchasing a gun but those same laws do not apply to current or ex-dating partners—this makes no sense. My plan to end gun violence would close the “Boyfriend Loophole” once and for all: https://t.co/6dTQ3SGJcM https://t.co/lfjvlCq5mK,2019-07-30 18:33:52,Twitter Web App,122,461
The right to vote is sacred and we should make it easier for everyone not harder. Our democracy is strongest when more people join in it. As president I will fight to protect and expand every American’s right to take part in our democracy. https://t.co/WUddW6bROs,2019-07-30 01:57:35,Twitter Web App,171,838

The War on Drugs is a war on people—one that disproportionately hurts people of color &amp; the poor. On Day One as president I’ll use my pardon power to set in motion a historic clemency process for those serving excessive sentences from our failed drug war. https://t.co/SpFcQBI6EK,2019-07-28 14:59:00,Twitter Web App,131,636
The Trump administration is targeting the most vulnerable in our society: The poor the elderly and children. Under its proposed policy 3 million Americans in need could lose the ability to put food on the table. This is outrageous. https://t.co/O9MO99EskY,2019-07-27 22:35:45,Twitter for iPhone,370,945
This is painful.  This is a moral defining moment in America.   Other generations had to answer:   When the Know Nothings McCarthy Wallace and so many others sought to demean degrade demagogue and divide   What did you do?  We must now answer.   Silence is toxic complicity. https://t.co/FkTw3u4c8g,2019-07-27 17:24:02,Twitter for iPhone,4024,16982
Real superheroes are ordinary people doing extraordinary things. George Allen a home care worker in NV is the very definition of this but we aren't doing right by him.

The death penalty is not justice—it's an immoral and ineffective form of punishment that has killed innocent people and is biased against people of color low-income and those with mental illness.

Today I spoke at the @NatUrbanLeague about electability.  The next Democratic party nominee must inspire &amp; earn the trust of our community.

After the constant moral vandalism we’ve seen from this administration we need a leader who's going to call us to be the best of who we are.

We can't be silent in the face of Trump's racist attacks. I'll defend anyone—Republican or Democrat—who is attacked because of their religion their ethnicity or the color of their skin.

Thank you @iupat_dc51 &amp; @IUPATDC711 for inviting me to talk about key issues that matter to working people.

The words Donald Trump chose to use were purposefully racist.

Gun violence is the second-highest cause of death among young people but it doesn’t need to be this way.

My Baby Bonds proposal will virtually close the racial wealth gap and level the playing field. https://t.co/DN19j0z4Tb,2019-06-18 19:08:16,Twitter Web Client,126,559
I am so grateful for the support of @KonfrstForHouse @RepAmyNielsen &amp; @marksmithiowa. It is not lost on me that it takes a collective effort to win this race—thank you for joining me in this fight. https://t.co/CRiX2AxOX6,2019-06-18 18:05:19,Twitter Web Client,36,159
This is a crisis. We need to call it what it is.   If we’re not talking about how to protect trans women of color and denouncing the targeting and hate they face then we’re contributing to it. Silence in the face of injustice is complicity. https://t.co/qlIjTpvUPF,2019-06-18 14:01:35,Twitter Web Client,261,876
We've watched enough of this trauma in viral videos to understand that it's not unusual. There's no room for a system where humans are treated this way &amp; we need to get serious about racial bias training &amp; real police oversight to stop this brutality. https://t.co/SmycNGFJTw,2019-06-17 21:31:43,Twitter Web Client,682,3286
.@lovejoy941 thank you for sharing your story. Not only are these fees an economic burden they prevent families from connecting with loved ones—connection that could determine whether someone rehabilitates or returns to jail. This is a step in the right direction. https://t.co/sWNDsUrZXE,2019-06-17 16:57:43,Twitter Web Client,28,165
The goal isn't just to stop the attack on Roe v. Wade. The goal is to advance women's rights and show the country what we already know to be true...  Abortion is health care. Contraception is health care. Reproductive freedom is health care ... https://t.co/lf3QuPwXvg,2019-06-17 14:43:50,Twitter Web Client,223,1029
It’s time to make a meaningful investment in Black entrepreneurship and economic empowerment. We can’t have large sections of our population denied equal access and think it’s not a cancer that affects the rest of the country as well. We need justice for all now.,2019-06-17 01:04:44,Twitter Web Client,51,295
And we will make sure working Americans have more money in their pocket by fixing the tax code making housing more affordable addressing the crushing student debt crisis and ensuring that higher education is not out of reach. https://t.co/vA670z8ZDu,2019-06-17 00:58:11,Twitter Web Client,45,288
We will boost entrepreneurship by expanding training programs and invest $1.5 billion into the State Small Business Credit Initiative. We will reform our criminal justice system so that people affected by the failed War on Drugs can apply for loans and have access to capital.,2019-06-17 00:54:28,Twitter Web Client,29,135
As president I will work to close that gap. My Baby Bonds proposal will create an interest-bearing savings account for every child born in the US. By age 18 the most impoverished kids would have access to nearly $50000 to start a new business or put a down payment on a home. https://t.co/Jtt8OKTpWR,2019-06-17 00:52:28,Twitter Web Client,52,207
White families hold nearly 10 times the wealth of Black families. Considering $30000 is about the average startup capital to launch a business (almost double the net worth of a median Black family) it’s no surprise we have economic inequality.,2019-06-17 00:48:18,Twitter Web Client,58,260
Black-owned businesses are so important to our communities—they create jobs and help families build wealth—but barriers to accessing capital and other racial inequities leave many unable to fully participate in our nation’s economic growth.,2019-06-17 00:42:30,Twitter Web Client,75,407
On #FathersDay this year I’m thinking about my dad &amp; how he was able to move our family from poverty to the middle class within the span of a single generation. This all thanks to the North Carolina family that took him in &amp; their small business—a Black-owned funeral home. https://t.co/x0frfdyqfH,2019-06-17 00:40:33,Twitter Web Client,235,2970

We need to provide a pathway to citizenship that recognizes Dreamers as Americans and removes the uncertainty from their lives. Everyone deserves to feel like they belong in this country and we will fight until that’s a reality.,2019-06-15 22:41:09,Twitter for iPhone,79,577
#DACA has allowed for thousands to live and work in the country they call home. We have to recommit to giving Dreamers what they deserve which is more than a temporary solution that doesn’t always provide protection for ALL those who need it.,2019-06-15 22:38:40,Twitter for iPhone,62,578
On the 7th anniversary of #DACA I want to thank Dreamers for always embodying the best of who we are. We see you and acknowledge that citizenship is more than a legal status. https://t.co/VMtJW4sq1T,2019-06-15 22:36:35,Twitter for iPhone,309,2022
It’s simple really. Americans deserve a fair wage &amp; safe working conditions. Today was inspiring but beyond that it was a reminder that people all over America are fighting for fairness &amp; equality. I’m honored to join them. #FightFor15 https://t.co/zJXi78ExiT,2019-06-15 16:58:26,Twitter for iPhone,92,423

Critical issues from gun violence prevention to access to affordable health care will be on the ballot this November in Virginia — and we have a real chance to #FlipVABlue. https://t.co/JBGWnizEZ9,2019-06-14 22:02:45,Twitter Web Client,69,223
Four. Months. Old.   This administration took an infant from their parent with no plan to reunify them. That's the level of xenophobia we're up against. https://t.co/5FCCQH3fah,2019-06-14 20:53:49,Twitter Web Client,15567,51134
I’m so excited to hit the stage for the first round of debates. But we’ll need 130000 unique donors to make sure I’m still on the stage for the debates starting in September. Can you chip in now to help make that happen? https://t.co/RbrWDXFWxT,2019-06-14 16:57:12,Twitter Web Client,53,215
To every single person who donated to all who have offered their support to my entire team... WE DID IT. Thank you! See you on the debate stage June 26. https://t.co/vQmRSUCwof,2019-06-14 16:40:54,Twitter Web Client,143,1609

It's a shame that the people who are often first in line to protect their city are not offered protection of their own in the form of fair wages &amp; workers' rights. I am proud to support downtown Detroit security officers in their fight for union rights. #OneDetroit #FightFor15 https://t.co/JoNyUixm5H,2019-06-13 23:06:52,Twitter Web Client,95,295
If we're serious about ending the scourge of gun violence we have to get serious about solutions that work—including licensing. https://t.co/sNJvcSE8hF,2019-06-13 16:51:29,Twitter Web Client,206,1205
The @BlkEconAlliance is doing such crucial work. Too often Black communities are barred from participating in economic advancement in ways other groups aren't.  We're going to change that. Excited to be a part of this conversation. https://t.co/WofD4ysZoo,2019-06-13 15:07:28,Twitter Web Client,48,152
It’s not “oppo research” — it’s foreign interference in US elections.  That you would say this is disgraceful. That you would do it from the Oval Office (yet again) proves you’re unfit for the office you hold. https://t.co/7YQn07yRbm,2019-06-13 01:31:40,Twitter Web Client,1941,8084
Civil Rights activist Medgar Evers was assassinated by a KKK member in front of his home 56 years ago today. The first field secretary for the Mississippi NAACP Evers fought for equality until the very end. He deserved more.

Three years ago at #Pulse nightclub we lost 49 lives to hate. I still hold the pain of this tragedy deep in my heart.  As president I will end the NRA's reign &amp; pass gun safety policy to save lives. We can—and we will—build a nation based on love &amp; respect for one another.,2019-06-12 13:51:53,Twitter Web Client,732,5840
This is horrifying on so many levels. We need to do more to protect women and girls. That means looking for loopholes like this that leave them (and their children) open to physical danger and mental trauma.  https://t.co/sbEahtQKc5,2019-06-12 01:39:35,Twitter Web Client,226,863
So many of the challenges in neighborhoods like mine—from shootings on my block to lead in our drinking water—were around long before Donald Trump became president.

A recent report found that in New York City alone there has been an 83% rise in hate crimes. Synagogues are being vandalized Pride flags burned people of color targeted. It's a good time to remind folks that it's not enough to claim you're not a bigot—you must be anti-bigotry. https://t.co/XG0bNNPP1m,2019-06-11 14:51:50,Twitter Media Studio,464,1779
The Equal Pay Act was signed into law 56 years ago today. But the wage gap still exists—it's even wider for women of color. We need to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act in the Senate so that women can hold employers accountable for giving them less for equal work.,2019-06-11 03:02:10,Twitter Web Client,260,1351
@my_dys You're right Michele this IS about what we're against. That's motivation but that's not the whole thing. When Trump is out of office we'll need to think about who we want to be and work together to get there. Beating Trump is our floor not our ceiling.,2019-06-10 20:37:26,Twitter Web Client,1,4

We can’t let this election be about what we are against. It must be about what we're for: —We are for Americans making a livable wage —We are for health care access for all —We are for ending the gun violence epidemic —We are for valuing public school teachers &amp; raising their pay,2019-06-09 19:49:45,Twitter Web Client,611,3427
This is a moral moment in America—we must meet this test. I’m running for president because we can’t take four more years of Donald Trump. Beating him will get us out of the valley—but it will not get us to the mountaintop. https://t.co/tEl59le6zX,2019-06-09 19:43:52,Twitter Web Client,103,552
