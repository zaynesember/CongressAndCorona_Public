The federal government should protect Americans not special interest #paydaylenders. But the Trump Admin is now proposing to drop consumer protections.  Abandoning consumers for payday lenders is itself unfair and abusive.   https://t.co/v2HYzKtLSh,2019-02-06 22:55:55,Twitter Web Client,17,31

GOP passed a nearly $2 Trillion #TrumpTax bill that overwhelmingly benefited corporations &amp; ultra-wealthy. Investing $100 Billion in upgrading America's schools could pay more effective economic dividends for the country &amp; help create 1.9 million jobs. #RebuildAmericasSchools https://t.co/5cyLN2QTYU,2019-01-30 19:45:19,Twitter Web Client,21,47
Good schools expand opportunities for students &amp; help create a healthier more vibrant community &amp; economy for all. But currently funding for public school buildings falls $46 Billion short. Federal gov't should step up &amp; Congress should pass the #RebuildAmericasSchools Act. https://t.co/oeozHD9tQT,2019-01-30 19:32:32,Twitter Web Client,9,21

Today I voted to end the #TrumpShutdown &amp; pay federal workers like #BorderPatrol. But GOP leaders blocked a bipartisan effort to reopen gov’t.
