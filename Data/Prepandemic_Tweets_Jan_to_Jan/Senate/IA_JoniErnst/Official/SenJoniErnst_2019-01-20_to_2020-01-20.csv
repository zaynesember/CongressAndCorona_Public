I often hear from #Iowa parents who struggle to balance family and work; and our small biz owners who just simply can’t afford to provide paid parental leave. I was glad to host @IvankaTrump and my colleagues today for a productive discussion on paid parental leave. https://t.co/T8jQpiakco,2019-05-23 20:51:03,Twitter for iPhone,285,2021

@DeptofDefense Ensuring our military has resources to defend our nation is a top priority. This includes making sure no dollar received by @DeptofDefense is wasted. I'm proposing a measure—similar to my #COSTAct—requiring fed agencies to put a price tag on projects. https://t.co/4yrbj8teUI,2019-05-23 14:19:10,Twitter Web App,2,18
Would you pay $1220 for a coffee cup☕️? Probably not but the @DeptofDefense did—25 times—w/your hard-earned tax dollars. The worst part is that’s just one example of the Pentagon’s budgetary blunders. That's why I'm giving them my monthly Squeal Award! https://t.co/dUOacqufez,2019-05-23 12:26:42,Twitter Web App,38,110
@VAChair The VA conducted a review of all their providers and found a small number of providers who were hired with revoked licenses. My bill focuses on that small group of providers. It’s a targeted oversight measure with minimal costs that will give our veterans peace of mind.,2019-05-22 18:43:22,Twitter Web App,1,5
@VAChair The Ensuring Quality Care for Our Veterans Act ensures that every provider who was hired with a revoked license will have their care scrutinized by a neutral third party.,2019-05-22 18:43:05,Twitter Web App,0,4
@VAChair Every veteran who was treated by a physician with a revoked license should have their medical care scrutinized by a neutral third-party. That’s exactly what my bill does.,2019-05-22 18:42:43,Twitter Web App,0,1
@VAChair Dr. Schneider never should have been hired to treat our veterans. While the VA reformed its hiring practices there are still veterans out there who were treated by physicians with revoked licenses but who don’t know if they received bad care.,2019-05-22 18:42:31,Twitter Web App,1,2
@VAChair All of this changed on December 3 2017. A disturbing report in USA Today found that the VA had knowingly hired providers with revoked medical licenses and who have a history of providing substandard care. One of those providers was Dr. Schneider.,2019-05-22 18:41:52,Twitter Web App,0,1
@VAChair However in the weeks and months following the surgery it became clear to Anthony that something was wrong. His health hadn’t improved and Dr. Schneider just said that it was part of the “symptoms” from the surgery.,2019-05-22 18:41:32,Twitter Web App,1,1
@VAChair Anthony was referred to a neurosurgeon at the Iowa City VA Dr. Schneider. Dr. Schneider performed surgery and stated he had removed all of the brain tumor.,2019-05-22 18:41:13,Twitter Web App,1,1
@VAChair Today I want to share the story of Anthony an #Iowa veteran. In 2017 Anthony was experiencing headaches so he went to the Iowa City VA Medical Center to get an MRI of his head and neck. Anthony’s MRI results came back. Tragically they indicated he had a brain tumor.,2019-05-22 18:40:41,Twitter Web App,0,1
Soon I'll be speaking at the @VAChair hearing on my bill the Ensuring Quality Care for Our Veterans Act which ensures a third party reviews each case where a veteran was treated by a VA provider who was later found to have a revoked license.

William Barr is extremely qualified to be atty general. We’ve passed bipartisan opioid leg &amp; reformed our criminal justice system but we need an AG in place to best implement these policies.

In the world's greatest deliberative body the United States Senate it is unfathomable that a bill that simply prohibits infanticide was blocked on the floor.

These bills are horrific and not who we are as Americans. There is no excuse to kill a baby – but the idea that Democrats are actually calling for the legalization of infanticide is a call to action. This isn’t just extreme it’s barbaric and inhumane.,2019-01-31 19:16:04,Twitter for iPhone,178,631
Sarah’s Law brings us closer to restoring justice in our broken immigration system by allowing law enforcement to detain &amp; hold criminals accountable.
