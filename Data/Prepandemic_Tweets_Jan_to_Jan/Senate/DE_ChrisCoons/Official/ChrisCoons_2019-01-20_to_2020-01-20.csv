The evidence against President Trump is compelling so if he has a case to make in his own defense this is his opportunity to offer it.

Leader McConnell is proud of presiding over a legislative graveyard but his responsibility now is to negotiate with Leader Schumer rules that give us a shot at a reasonable trial.

Delaware clearly benefits from this NAFTA update. Our organized labor members poultry farmers and financial services workers will all see economic benefits.

Important piece from @KamalaHarris in the @nytimes as we move toward an impeachment trial in the Senate. I’ll share some key excerpts below https://t.co/aFiY7bYAuJ,2019-12-19 02:32:36,Twitter for iPhone,144,333
Make no mistake – repealing the Affordable Care Act is the health care policy of the Republican Party.,2019-12-18 23:39:44,TweetDeck,38,83
To be clear: Over 135 million Americans with pre-existing conditions *remain at risk* of losing protections and millions of Americans could see their premiums rise.   We should be working together to fix our health care system instead of sabotaging it.,2019-12-18 23:39:16,TweetDeck,27,81
A U.S. circuit court just sent the Trump-backed lawsuit seeking to kill the Affordable Care Act to a lower court.   This means this dangerous lawsuit is still a threat to Americans’ health care – and we can’t give up the fight to stop it.,2019-12-18 23:38:17,TweetDeck,81,171
While we work to get weapons of war off of our streets and keep guns out of the hands of criminals we can also work to ensure that firearms already in Americans’ homes are stored safely and away from children.,2019-12-18 21:43:01,Twitter for iPhone,5,11
We need to do everything we can to stop gun-related deaths in the United States from big bold reforms to smaller targeted efforts like this.,2019-12-18 21:42:47,Twitter for iPhone,7,21
4.6 million kids in America live in a household with a firearm and we know that more than half of those guns aren’t safely stored.  We have to change that so I helped introduce the Safe Gun Storage Act to establish basic safety standards for firearm locks and firearm safes.,2019-12-18 21:38:40,Twitter for iPhone,26,73
At a time when it seems Republicans and Democrats can’t agree on much Senators of both parties and our staffs share a deep admiration and gratitude for the work of the Capitol Police. Thank you for your service and for keeping us safe!,2019-12-18 20:29:32,TweetDeck,9,25
One of my favorite holiday traditions is joining my Law Enforcement Caucus Co-Chair Senator @RoyBlunt in showing our appreciation to the Capitol Police who keep us all safe and keep the U.S. Capitol open and accessible. https://t.co/Yip5wYO7N8,2019-12-18 20:27:57,TweetDeck,9,27
Today the Senate voted on another one of President Trump’s unqualified judicial nominees Matthew McFarland.  I am very concerned about his record on the bench so I voted no. #courtsmatter,2019-12-18 20:16:44,Twitter for iPhone,37,142
Read more about the bill here! https://t.co/q7VDcOujld,2019-12-18 19:54:49,Twitter for iPhone,3,4
The bill also guarantees 12 weeks of paid parental leave for all federal workers includes support for service members who have been exposed to toxic chemicals &amp; repeals the so-called widow’s tax which prevents surviving spouses of military members from receiving full benefits.,2019-12-18 19:54:28,Twitter for iPhone,3,9
The bill authorizes a new $21 million Army Reserve Center in Newark to serve as a modern training facility for Delaware’s Reservists and $28 million for upgrades to the Army’s heavy lift Chinook helicopter to be carried out by hardworking Delawareans around the region.,2019-12-18 19:52:52,Twitter for iPhone,4,12
Despite everything else that's happening in Washington - we also got some big things done for Delaware this week. I voted to help pass our annual defense authorization bill which is now being signed into law.,2019-12-18 19:52:22,Twitter for iPhone,9,57
I’m proud to introduce bipartisan legislation with @lisamurkowski to fix this glaring problem and ensure surviving spouses and families of veterans with ALS receive the benefits they are owed. Thank you @iamalsorg @alsassociation @DAVHQ @PVA1946 for your support. #CuresForAll,2019-12-18 17:13:35,TweetDeck,26,102
Under current policy surviving spouses only qualify if a veteran with ALS has lived with the disease for *at least* eight years even though the average life expectancy for a person with ALS is two to five years.   That’s unacceptable.,2019-12-18 17:12:34,TweetDeck,23,55
Fact: Military veterans are twice as likely to develop ALS as those who haven’t served in the military.   Although the gov’t has entitled veterans with ALS and their spouses to important benefits there remains a part of the policy that we must fix.,2019-12-18 17:11:55,TweetDeck,30,80
There remain many pieces of the tax reform law that I oppose and will continue working to repeal tax cuts to corporations and the wealthiest Americans but we have to make progress on a bipartisan basis when we can and LIFT is a step in the right direction.,2019-12-18 16:39:58,TweetDeck,5,7
I’m proud that bipartisan House and Senate negotiators have agreed to a package that will include my bill with @SenatorLankford the LIFT for Charities Act to repeal this new nonprofit tax. https://t.co/agV2MrasF1,2019-12-18 16:39:07,TweetDeck,8,12
For the first time charitable orgs were required to pay federal taxes on certain employee benefits such as parking meals or transportation. The tax brought in little revenue for the government and it harmed charities’ ability to focus on and carry out their mission.,2019-12-18 16:38:02,TweetDeck,6,11
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was supposed to make it easier for people to pay taxes. But for many charities—including churches synagogues and other houses of worship—the law imposed a burdensome new tax.,2019-12-18 16:36:49,TweetDeck,6,16

There are a lot of red flags in Steven Menashi’s record.   I’m concerned he doesn’t have the temperament or judgment to sit on a federal court of appeals – and these are bipartisan concerns.   We can do better than this.,2019-11-08 20:06:02,TweetDeck,7,58
As reported in @nytimes Menashi was the legal brain behind an Education Department strategy that denied debt relief to students in violation of federal privacy law by using Social Security data. https://t.co/zNMspMNk7N,2019-11-08 20:04:23,TweetDeck,27,47
Menashi did disclose that he’d been involved in several aspects of the Education Department’s operations.    That includes working alongside @BetsyDeVosED to strip away protections for students sexual assault survivors for people of color &amp; for the LGBT community.,2019-11-08 20:02:43,TweetDeck,17,30
It’s clear that Menashi was at the center of some of the worst legal decisions &amp; controversial policies of this administration.,2019-11-08 20:02:03,TweetDeck,8,23
There was broad bipartisan frustration at his confirmation hearing over his lack of candor &amp; the fact that he left many important questions unanswered.,2019-11-08 20:01:25,TweetDeck,4,16

Simply put – Sarah Pitlyk lacks significant relevant experience in the courtroom. So I struggle to understand why the White House nominated her for a lifetime seat on the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri.,2019-10-31 17:35:16,TweetDeck,30,93
That rating was not based on some hidden partisan agenda.    That’s based on the fact that Pitlyk has *never* tried a case criminal or civil. She has *never* taken a deposition examined a witness or even argued a motion in state or federal trial court.,2019-10-31 17:32:50,TweetDeck,49,129
