H.R. 1 is reserved each Congress for the Speaker to be used to better the lives of all Americans. Nancy Pelosi has decided to use it to protect the Dem's majority in the House instead. It will always be politics before the American people for Pelosi. https://t.co/uGbcWqnGou,2019-02-11 17:53:21,Twitter Web Client,1,2

Another crucial matter that I completely agree with President Trump on!  Given recent legislation that would allow full term abortions--We MUST be a voice for the voiceless and fight for our unborn.  https://t.co/D6fylop8wf,2019-02-07 19:53:42,Twitter Web Client,0,0
Another migrant caravan headed toward our border.  As one of four Republican House members on the Homeland Security Conference Committee—my number one priority remains BORDER SECURITY FIRST.  https://t.co/psbCU3CZg1,2019-02-04 17:00:43,Twitter Web Client,0,0

This is ridiculous.   Can you imagine if someone had been asked to not wear an Obama shirt???                                            https://t.co/5dptsM6sGX,2019-01-26 19:53:00,Twitter for iPhone,1,2
Liberals want to claim the moral high ground when it comes to border security and immigrant children yet they put up NO fight for the lives taken here??? https://t.co/Q8XZbwjDo4,2019-01-26 19:51:31,Twitter for iPhone,0,1
In my recent op-ed published by the Hill Rep. Andy Harris and I discuss our Border Bonds for America Act.  Border security is national security. We can't afford to let political games get in the way of protecting our nation and its citizens.  https://t.co/u94NwPLyRW,2019-01-22 17:39:24,Twitter Web Client,1,2
Good work President Trump! It is time Democrats begin negotiating a deal that secures the border and ends the shutdown.  https://t.co/It0leZMbwQ,2019-01-22 17:38:02,Twitter Web Client,0,1
