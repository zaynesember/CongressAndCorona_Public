How can any House Democrat definitively say that they support impeachment? They don't have the facts yet back impeachment - not because they know the truth or have any evidence - but because they are committed to overturning the results of the 2016 election.   #StopTheSchiffShow,2019-10-23 14:36:00,TweetDeck,23,35
The American people deserve transparency in the impeachment inquiry process. Yet there is no regard for the rules and this entire process is happening behind closed doors.   This is a duly elected President and the public should know the case against him.  #StopTheSchiffShow,2019-10-23 14:21:10,Twitter Web App,370,1026
