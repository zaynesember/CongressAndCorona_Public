The president's decision to usher in Turkey’s military incursion empowered an ethnic cleansing campaign against our Kurdish partners. Period.

Today’s vote to sanction Turkey is one facet of a solution to fix Trump's disastrous policy.   We can't protect our Kurdish partners in Syria through indefinite troop deployments. We need a multilateral diplomatic campaign to end the violence and create accountability in Syria.,2019-10-29 21:06:19,Twitter Web App,8,25

A month ago--I questioned Director of DHHS’ Office of Refugee Resettlement Jonathan Hayes where we found out 1200 empty beds in the Homestead detention center costs us $720k/day.
