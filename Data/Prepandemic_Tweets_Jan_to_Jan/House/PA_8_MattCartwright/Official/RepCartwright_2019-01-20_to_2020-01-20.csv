Happy Presidents’ Day everyone. Have a look at this short editorial. It’s about HR 1 the #ForThePeople Act authored by my good friend @RepSarbanes. Let’s protect the democracy Washington fought so hard to create and Lincoln fought so hard to preserve. https://t.co/rSgFQ3M9RH,2019-02-18 14:24:13,Twitter for iPhone,17,41
As a senior member of @AppropsDems I’m concerned about protecting the spending power of Congress. And as an American I’m really concerned about the constitutionality of this kind of declaration as it threatens one of the core pillars of our republic: the separation of powers.,2019-02-15 18:36:17,Twitter Web Client,4,24
The president's emergency declaration is not a smart move. Democrats and Republicans worked hard to reach a bipartisan deal to keep our government open one that would strengthen and invest in border security in effective ways.,2019-02-15 18:36:17,Twitter Web Client,6,21
It's been one year since the #Parkland community said goodbye to 17 beautiful souls whose lives were lost in a matter of minutes. Let's keep working to make sure these tragedies like these never happen again. #MSDStrong #NeverAgain https://t.co/UJiCTJoHl2,2019-02-14 12:44:00,TweetDeck,9,34
I'd like to thank @AFGENational and the Council of Prison Locals C-33 for this honor. I'm proud to fight for our law enforcement officers in Congress and I applaud the work you do every day to help keep Pennsylvania and the rest of the country safe. https://t.co/vQ4clgdY6C,2019-02-13 17:34:24,Twitter Web Client,6,13
Paid leave means being able to care for your newborn child or an ailing family member without worrying about affording your bills or retaliation from your employer. That's why I support the #FAMILYAct and I'm proud to be one of its cosponsors. https://t.co/z7JYbem4EV,2019-02-12 19:39:33,Twitter Web Client,13,30
FEMA’s FY2018 Staffing for Adequate Fire &amp; Emergency Response (SAFER) application opens on Friday February 15 @ 8am &amp; close on Friday March 22 @ 5pm. I am a strong advocate for programs like SAFER that keep communities safe. For more information: https://t.co/PRmGB0ynbH https://t.co/f4wM9N0wVe,2019-02-11 20:36:16,Twitter Web Client,2,5
Saddened by the passing of my colleague Walter Jones from North Carolina. Sending condolences and strength to his family at this difficult time.,2019-02-11 15:22:37,Twitter Web Client,0,4
Today my thoughts and prayers are with my colleague @RepDebDingell after the passing of her husband. Congressman John Dingell was a beloved legislator who served the people of Michigan in Congress for nearly six decades. He will be missed.,2019-02-08 14:50:58,Twitter Web Client,3,14
We must keep working to make sure every American can afford their medicines. That’s why I’m proud to cosponsor the Medicare Negotiation and Competitive Licensing Act which would put patients first and allow Medicare to negotiate fair drug prices for our seniors. #ForThePeople https://t.co/HSntUDRu2E,2019-02-07 17:00:27,Twitter Web Client,34,50
After tonight's #SOTU it’s time for @realDonaldTrump to add substance to his words of bipartisanship and unity by working with Democrats to rebuild our nation’s transportation infrastructure and bring down the skyrocketing costs of prescription drugs.,2019-02-06 03:48:07,Twitter Web Client,5,26
I invited Allen Fritz an air traffic controller from Pennsylvania and a member of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (@NATCA) as my guest for tonight's #SOTU. He was one of thousands of selfless Americans who worked without pay during the government shutdown. https://t.co/VlzARFKdgn,2019-02-06 01:33:20,Twitter Web Client,4,38
We celebrate the courage of so many who helped shape the beliefs and values of all people. “I knew someone had to take the first step and I made up my mind not to move.” - #RosaParks #BlackHistoryMonth https://t.co/yL6wdk6Wxa,2019-02-04 18:05:45,Twitter Web Client,3,10
Mitch McConnell doesn’t want: - big money out of politics - to protect our national sovereignty - you to vote https://t.co/SyHQ8pSeRH,2019-01-31 18:58:11,Twitter for iPhone,14,43
I'm proud to introduce legislation to Make Voting Accessible for All American Workers. The "Time Off To Vote Act" would require employers to grant their employees at least two hours of paid leave to vote in federal elections. https://t.co/E2PGpMo130,2019-01-30 19:43:46,Twitter Web Client,9,43
S&amp;P also estimated our economy lost $24 BN from Ted Cruz’s 2013 shutdown. That means tens of thousands of lost jobs every time. Shutdowns should be off limits. https://t.co/wZHmrPKpju,2019-01-26 16:18:58,Twitter for iPhone,10,31
I’ll be stopping in at St Luke’s tomorrow to help out with this. Come on already. #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/UkIbJMqeU2,2019-01-25 00:30:56,Twitter for iPhone,7,17
The House has passed 10 bills to reopen government and allow hardworking federal employees get back to work and get paid in full but Mitch McConnell has refused to take up the bipartisan legislation. Shutting down the government is not an effective governing tool.#EndTheShutdown,2019-01-24 19:57:57,Twitter Web Client,9,32
