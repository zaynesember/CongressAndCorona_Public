Wow! The Democrats have truly become the party of the extreme left-wing. Their socialist ideas are rejected by most Americans who understand that the strong economic policies of @realDonaldTrump are working all the way from Wall Street to Main Street! https://t.co/warg0gZNBl,2019-07-31 11:49:53,Twitter for iPhone,3,13

So the presidential candidate who got no traction on the single issue of gun control drops out the day before Va Governor Ralph Northam's special session begins on the single issue of...you guessed it gun control. #passingalosingtorch #quitwhileyourebehind #MolonLabe https://t.co/jR3CT95YTM,2019-07-08 21:15:22,Twitter for Android,10,27

Sorry but the Dillon Rule contributes to Virginia's amazing economic success and top business rankings. Pennsylvania doesn't even rank among the top half. Thanks but I'm going to keep #winningwithWilt. https://t.co/xvvskqDrGG,2019-04-05 13:35:48,Twitter for Android,2,28

@JoeNBC Agreed Joe. The Governor is a distraction and can no longer effectively recruit employers to come to Virginia. He needs to resign for the future of the Commonwealth.,2019-02-28 21:28:33,Twitter for iPhone,0,1

On this day 33 years ago the heroes of the Challenger "slipped the surly bonds of Earth to touch the face of God."  The men and women of Challenger were the heartbeat of America.
