Yesterday on #NationalReligiousFreedomDay the Trump administration made a MONUMENTAL stand for religious freedom by proposing rules that would level the playing field for religious groups and further protect prayer in public schools.

As someone who litigated cases in federal court for 20 years I can tell you Democrats have a real problem - they don't have the facts or the law on their side.

My takeaway from today's #Iran briefing -- we had good intel it was carefully vetted and @realDonaldTrump was right to act swiftly and decisively to take out Soleimani.

Radical Ds have vowed &amp; voted to impeach Pres. Trump since the day of his election &amp; now they're pulling the trigger on what one expert witness described as 'the shortest proceeding with the thinnest evidentiary record and the narrowest grounds ever used to impeach a president',2019-12-10 15:23:55,Twitter Web App,24,59
As Nancy Pelosi Adam Schiff and Jerry Nadler release their Articles of #Impeachment there is less support for impeachment today among the American people – and even among House Democrats – than there was when their sham proceedings began. 1/3,2019-12-10 15:23:55,Twitter Web App,89,266

Free speech is one of our most sacred unalienable rights and yet for more than 60 yrs pastors and churches have been subjected to government censorship.   The Johnson Amendment stands in stark contrast to who we are as Americans and should be repealed. https://t.co/8HNjWwEm6b,2019-02-04 20:30:05,TweetDeck,2,11
30 yrs. ago I was blessed to take a life-changing trip to DC as a Capt. Shreve HS student.   This past week I had the pleasure of hosting the 2019 Capt.

House Dems voted this week to reward individuals who have engaged in sexual misconduct with a pay raise.  This is just wrong. Unfortunately this legislation passed simply because the majority could not stomach a commonsense solution from the minority. https://t.co/bhnLxpluBr,2019-02-01 20:42:30,TweetDeck,4,7
THIS. IS. MURDER.  By now you may have seen the incredible video of VA's liberal governor defending killing an infant AFTER birth. Here is the bill's author clarifying her intent as well.  God have mercy on our nation! https://t.co/pUatmEaOFP,2019-01-31 20:42:00,TweetDeck,4,16
I joined @FoxNews this morning to discuss the dangerous trends we are seeing in Congress and across America. The far Left is now advancing a radical agenda to undermine original American traditions.  We need every citizen to help us sound the alarm and oppose these initiatives. https://t.co/1NGNIbWaFX,2019-01-31 15:12:20,TweetDeck,19,41
H.R. 1 makes it easier for fraudulent voters to register across the United States and subvert the voice of the American people.   If they were “for the people” they would protect the integrity of every American’s vote. #ForTheDemocrats https://t.co/DgTCdYxZ0Y,2019-01-29 22:31:13,Twitter for iPhone,56,87
H.R. 1 seeks to eliminate free speech for certain groups of individuals simply because they have joined together despite SCOTUS decision that says this is unconstitutional.   They are “for the people” as long as the people agree with them. #ForTheDemocrats,2019-01-29 22:31:11,Twitter for iPhone,19,40
With the introduction of. H.R. 1 the “For the People” Act Democrats aim to pad campaign coffers with taxpayer dollars. Yet at the same time they continue to refuse to adequately fund border security.     “For the people” sounds more like #ForTheDemocrats. https://t.co/lEmoDbBpYi,2019-01-29 22:31:10,Twitter for iPhone,234,401

Today America remembers a man who became one of the most prominent figures in our history by standing up for love truth and human dignity.   The best way to honor the legacy of the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. is to continue to advance those same timeless principles. https://t.co/yVnkzPJJlP,2019-01-21 16:30:00,TweetDeck,1,10
