Voting is a foundational right &amp; it is essential that there are as few barriers as possible for registration &amp; participation in our democracy. I believe if we start this process at a young age we can spur political participation &amp; engagement in all Americans #NextGenerationVotes https://t.co/nXQwc6ezms,2019-01-30 15:28:05,TweetDeck,44,153
Ecologists and conservationists are bracing for lasting damage on the nation’s public lands and wild places as a result of the government shutdown — including harm to fossils and ancient rock carvings in Utah and Colorado. https://t.co/AXIK6FSSYW,2019-01-29 21:49:00,TweetDeck,9,9
Access &amp; transparency in our voting system is vital to the integrity of our democracy. In 2016 92 million eligible Americans did not vote in 2014 we witnessed the lowest voter participation in 72 years. It's essential that all Americans are provided the opportunity to vote #HR1,2019-01-29 19:27:28,TweetDeck,3,11
