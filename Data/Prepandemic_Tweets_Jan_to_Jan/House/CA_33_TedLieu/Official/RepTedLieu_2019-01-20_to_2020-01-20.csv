When older workers lose their jobs they are far more likely than other workers to join the ranks of the long-term unemployed.

Trump appears to seek to redirect funds that help disaster prone areas in CA &amp; military construction that helps military families. Hurting disaster victims &amp; military families to build a medieval wall is not the dumbest idea ever but it comes pretty close https://t.co/OITCVTzY6Q,2019-02-15 04:42:19,Twitter for iPhone,477,1521
There is no #NationalEmergency. Based on the Trump Administration's own data:  ⬇️ Border Apprehensions: Down 75% from 2000 to 2018 ⬇️ Violent &amp; Property Crime: Down across the U.S. ✅ 80% to 90% of illegal drugs come through legal checkpoints,2019-02-15 04:37:01,Twitter for iPhone,618,1804
Trump's proposed Declaration of a National Emergency is an authoritarian power grab that will be struck down in the courts. The Constitution gives the House the ‘Power of the Purse’ and Trump cannot override the Constitution with a fake declaration.,2019-02-15 04:27:39,Twitter for iPhone,590,2154
Trump is declaring a #NationalEmergency to build a wall we don’t need to address a crisis that doesn’t exist! It's time for @POTUS to face the facts on this episode of #TruthWithTed. https://t.co/TiE5DyQdsT,2019-02-15 00:57:22,Twitter Media Studio,8736,24517
