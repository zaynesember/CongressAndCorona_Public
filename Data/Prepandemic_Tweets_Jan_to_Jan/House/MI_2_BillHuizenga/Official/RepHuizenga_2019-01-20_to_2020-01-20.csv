I believe we should create a culture that respects and values life. The Born-Alive Survivors Protection Act requires children who survive an attempted abortion to receive the same care as a child born at the same stage of life.

It’s time for the House to go on record and hold a vote. It’s hard to believe that in 2019 Democrats are openly denying an innocent child the ability to make their mark on the world. I would have never imagined that this would be a partisan fight.,2019-04-30 17:53:51,Twitter Web Client,12,22
