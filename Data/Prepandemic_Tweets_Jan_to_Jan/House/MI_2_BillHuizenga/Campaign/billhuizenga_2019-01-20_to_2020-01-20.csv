I voted no on the latest $1.4 trillion spending bill. The longer Congress waits to rein in spending even in the short term the more difficult the decisions we must make as a nation become. https://t.co/JLNXSHMq2I,2019-12-23 14:24:56,Twitter for iPhone,1,6

Really @chrislhayes... you are smarter (and know better) than that! The issue is members like me have been barred from any of the information that has been brought out. And before you start I sit on the House @FinancialCmte which is one of the 6 named “investigative” committees. https://t.co/9uAcywsTwi,2019-11-06 22:20:23,Twitter for iPhone,12,18

Sorry Brad House rules say that once Info hits HPCI (aka Intel Comm) those members are NOT allowed to talk about the material regardless if it is classified or not. Oh have you seen something out of Judiciary Comm these past few weeks? Nope... for a reason. #KeepItSecret https://t.co/lXU4e0CLuj,2019-10-25 02:49:41,Twitter for iPhone,5,9

Not really true... but yes for a few decades my Dad was a city councilman in Zeeland and a county commissioner in Ottawa.

Not exactly the game I (nor anyone else!) expected since the score reflected what these teams usually see in the 1st Qtr... but the expected outcome! Not sure how anyone can deny that Brady is the #GOAT at QB. Congrats @Patriots on your win! #SuperBowlLlll,2019-02-04 03:27:23,Twitter for iPhone,0,7
Expecting a much more offense oriented game with a score to reflect that... not so much. All defense all the time! https://t.co/pHkObYCnDu,2019-02-04 01:05:54,Twitter for iPhone,0,6

Hate to tell you but there are Democrat House members that believe @realDonaldTrump should address the House and Senate and by extension the American people. I know I’ve talked to them... but will the AOC wing of your party allow it to happen??? https://t.co/ENHOyCdKWY,2019-01-23 22:59:47,Twitter for iPhone,0,0
