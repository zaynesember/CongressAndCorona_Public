This @EnergyCommerce hearing is another attempt to distract from Dems' agenda to establish government-run single-payer health care. Although they refuse to discuss their radical plan with GOP E&amp;C Members they're clearly happy to share it with the media. https://t.co/WnkxDPetXy,2019-02-13 16:01:26,Twitter Web Client,4,7
Nearly every day I hear from Texans about their sky-high premiums &amp; deductibles. What good is health insurance if you're afraid to use it because you can’t afford your deductible? Unfortunately today's @EnergyCommerce hearing is a missed opportunity to address this urgent issue.,2019-02-13 16:00:26,Twitter Web Client,2,6

Under the Trump Administration @SecAzar and @HHSGov are providing excellent care to the children entrusted to their custody. At today’s @EnergyCommerce hearing we should recognize these public servants for their steadfast service to these children.,2019-02-07 16:47:42,Twitter Web Client,3,6
As a physician and a congressman I take oversight of @HHSGov very seriously.

President Trump is committed to protecting workers &amp; fighting unfair #trade deals by equalizing U.S. tariffs with those of other nations.

The excellent January #jobsreport not only indicates that 300000+ more Americans have jobs but also that more families have access to employer-sponsored health insurance - a far better option than #Obamacare marketplace or any other government-mandated coverage.,2019-02-01 19:03:04,Twitter Web Client,1,3
