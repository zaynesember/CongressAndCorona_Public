I’m pleased to announce that I will NOT be gathering signatures for my 2020 re-election. I was originally elected by delegates in 2012 and fully embrace and endorse Utah’s caucus-convention system. I look forward to meeting with as many delegates as possible in the coming months. https://t.co/Sh4eqIvBo9,2020-01-04 03:07:32,Twitter for iPhone,8,17
Contributions will be split 50/50 with President Trump's campaign! The end of the year is a critical deadline for both my campaign and the Presidents. Can you chip in $25 $50 or $100 today to Keep America Great? https://t.co/J4pGBCHHcT,2019-12-31 16:55:07,Twitter for iPhone,0,1
That is what this vote was about. Liberals are seeking to overturn the 2016 election and impose their will through impeachment --and we won't stand for that. Stand with me in supporting President Trump by donating to both of our campaigns,2019-12-31 15:50:01,Twitter for iPhone,1,4
That day was about one thing and one thing only. They hate this President. They hate those of us who voted for him. They think we are stupid they think we made a mistake. They think that Hillary Clinton should be President and they want to fix that.,2019-12-31 15:50:01,Twitter for iPhone,1,0
As co-chair of President Trump's re-election campaign in Utah it is critical Utah stands with our President. Let’s be clear the House vote to impeach the President had nothing to do with Ukraine nothing to do with abuse of power and nothing to do with obstruction of Congress.,2019-12-31 15:50:01,Twitter for iPhone,2,14

They want to take away my vote and throw it in the trash. They want to take away my president and delegitimize him so he cannot be re-elected. That is what this vote is about. #utpol #gop,2019-12-18 21:26:34,Twitter for iPhone,1,1

House Intelligence Committee Member Chris Stewart R-Utah said Democrats have been "crying wolf" on alleged wrongdoing on the part of President Trump for a long time and "you can only cry wolf so many times and eventually people will quit listening."  https://t.co/ArbbBQKSJC,2019-11-19 16:46:08,Twitter for iPhone,6,15
“I think that public support for impeachment is actually going to be less when these hearings are over than it is when the hearings began because finally the American people are going to be able to see the evidence” Stewart said. #utpol #gop https://t.co/nO1NSyt6ye,2019-11-17 22:18:23,Twitter for iPhone,4,8
"I don't think the evidence has been building at all" said Rep. Chris Stewart R-Utah. "I think the evidence is crumbling. I think the Democrats know they're in trouble on this which is why we keep moving the goalposts." #utpol #gop https://t.co/EPECxOVTfB,2019-11-17 19:26:46,Twitter for iPhone,3,4
Democrats know what kind of threat my leadership will be to their agenda and they will do anything to prevent that from happening.

Last night my questions to Ambassador Yovanavitch were the top story on https://t.co/oBmsGuKMRN! "The American people know this is nonsense" Stewart said. "The American people know this is unfair." #utpol #gop https://t.co/zNNEvz7MpV,2019-11-16 14:57:27,Twitter for iPhone,2,4
From the view of the White House and some top Republicans U.S. Rep. Chris Stewart's questioning of former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch on Friday was the point where House Democrats' showed the party had "no case" against President Trump. https://t.co/nWr3WoPh9V,2019-11-16 04:53:33,Twitter for iPhone,2,13
If someone was a candidate for a political office even for president of the United States should they be immune from investigation?,2019-11-14 16:35:29,Twitter for iPhone,0,4
I just think it’s interesting that out of hundreds of corrupt individuals dozens of corrupt nations that happened one time and it happened with the individual whose son was being paid by the organization that was under investigation.  https://t.co/Cv5EAnXAWZ,2019-11-14 16:34:43,Twitter for iPhone,1,3
MYTH 3: Biden should be immune from scrutiny because he is a political candidate.  MYTH 4: This is a fair process and the same as President Bill Clinton's and Richard Nixon's impeachment processes,2019-11-13 23:46:12,Twitter for iPhone,1,6
As impeachment plays out on television screens across America it’s important that we separate fact from fiction. Here’s what to watch for.  MYTH 1: The identity and testimony of the whistleblower do not matter.  MYTH 2: Trump broke the law.  https://t.co/rGN5Oxuo02,2019-11-13 23:45:45,Twitter for iPhone,3,8

My job is to serve the interests of my constituents not defend President Trump. My fear is that by attempting to impeach over essentially a policy difference we lower the bar so low that no president will ever serve a 4-year term again.  #utpol https://t.co/Cc8X8qcZof,2019-10-31 20:13:36,Twitter for iPhone,2,7

People shouldn’t rush to impeach Trump without hearing all the evidence. It’s unfair to say the president betrayed the country before knowing what happened.  https://t.co/c5qRtRvBv8,2019-09-26 15:35:20,Twitter for iPhone,3,8
The fact is we don’t know what happened here” Stewart said on Fox News of Trump’s conversation with new Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. “Adam Schiff doesn’t know. Nancy Pelosi doesn’t know. The 87 Democrats running for president don’t know.” https://t.co/9zQpVqaaF6,2019-09-24 18:30:52,Twitter for iPhone,0,2
I did not support the recent continuing resolution. CR's not only harm our national defense but are a completely irresponsible way to govern.
