@karenhandel @mtgreenee @davidhogg111 @infowars (10/10) This is what we're up against in 2020 and we cannot lose the progress we've made on gun safety.

@karenhandel @mtgreenee @davidhogg111 @infowars (9/10) Greene is funding her anti-immigrant anti-LGTBQ anti-gun safety rhetoric with a $500000 personal loan she made to her campaign. @mtgreenee will say anything and spend anything to defeat our gun safety movement. #GreeneFacts  https://t.co/GSrSD5X8mO,2019-11-19 23:09:31,Twitter Web App,18,64
@karenhandel @mtgreenee @davidhogg111 @infowars (8/10) After the worst mass shooting in our country's history in Las Vegas @mtgreenee spread conspiracy theories that the shooting was engineered by gun safety advocates.

@karenhandel @mtgreenee @davidhogg111 (7/10) @mtgreenee has built her MAGA-based online following by spreading right-wing conspiracy theories and filming stunt videos.

@karenhandel @mtgreenee @davidhogg111 (6/10) My other opponent @mtgreenee is almost as extreme as @karenhandel.

@karenhandel @mtgreenee @davidhogg111 (2/10) @karenhandel is too extreme to ever represent #GA06 again.

@karenhandel And I remember feeling thankful for all of you. I could not have won #GA06 without your help.

@karenhandel (4/x) Lately Handel has been trying to win back votes by changing her tune.   We will not be fooled by a flip-flopping career politician. I will continue to stand up for what is right.   https://t.co/uLJFmvu6Xs,2019-10-14 22:47:34,Twitter Web App,12,64
@karenhandel (3/x) Handel has stated on the record that she believes gay couples shouldn’t be allowed to adopt children.   When pressed further by a reporter she offered a simple explanation: “Because I don’t.”  https://t.co/nbklyDZ6zp,2019-10-14 22:47:13,Twitter Web App,11,57
@karenhandel (2/x) - To put it kindly Karen Handel has an awful track record when it comes to LGBTQ rights.   In 2017 she laughed at a question about gay marriage. She said "Why is marriage between one man and one woman? Are you serious?"   https://t.co/fhN3ihkOHL,2019-10-14 22:45:57,Twitter Web App,12,59
I hugged so many people along the parade route who shared their stories with me.   Some even became emotional as they talked about how monumental it is that we voted out @karenhandel in 2018.

#HB481 would make abortion illegal beyond pregnancies of six weeks. Six weeks is BEFORE most women even know they are pregnant.   This bill (if it passes) would effectively ban abortion in Georgia.

I support universal background checks in the name of my son but also all the other survivors and families I have worked with over the years that are depending on Congress to do right by them in keeping them safe.  https://t.co/6wqQvvNF2j,2019-03-02 17:40:00,TweetDeck,279,1608
Mariyum my father taught me from a very young age - the promise of our country is that if you do not like the politics then you can change them.   It will never be easy but the future of our country depends on it. https://t.co/aMQC3lBq9b,2019-03-01 18:03:31,Twitter for iPhone,596,4849

For me and all other families who know the pain of losing a loved one to gun violence - this has been a historic week.   Momentum is on our side and we are making our nation safer.  https://t.co/P2CZOxLClG,2019-02-28 18:50:43,Twitter for iPhone,3305,20524

We are reaching the end-of-month deadline but we are still short of our goal. Could you chip in now to help our re-election efforts? https://t.co/bnf3IhwlRC,2019-02-27 16:55:00,TweetDeck,29,74
More than a dozen retired top military advisers are throwing their weight behind universal background checks. It is time we enact background checks for all gun sales. https://t.co/QCPLyLvRsk,2019-02-26 20:18:00,TweetDeck,117,480
Jordan - you are my strongest ally and will forever be my best friend.   Today you turn 24 but the impact of your story will last forever. ❤️ https://t.co/HIqmApGIA0,2019-02-16 15:54:33,Twitter for iPhone,4059,36013
During the marches the rallies and the speeches - we must never forget the lives lost.   I stand with the Parkland community because the safety of our children is at stake.   https://t.co/NlIxeEVHbE,2019-02-15 00:03:13,Twitter for iPhone,354,2382
My son Jordan would have turned 24 this month. Yesterday's hearing (covered here by @politico) was an important step towards common-sense gun policy reform.  https://t.co/YnSBUmT5Dx,2019-02-07 16:38:56,Twitter Web Client,1491,8792
I was so thrilled to be @Lawrence O'Donnell's guest on @TheLastWord on Tuesday.   We talked about introducing H.R. 8 for universal background checks campaigning in Newt Gingrich's old district and how Jordan would be proud of my work in Washington: https://t.co/1qn30a2C2s https://t.co/82iN01NYcF,2019-01-31 18:23:07,Twitter Web Client,285,1759
@VoteRunLead Thank YOU! 🗳🏃🏾‍♀️💃🏽,2019-01-29 16:45:38,Twitter Web Client,0,5
So inspiring to speak to a group of future leaders! @VoteRunLead.   In 2018 I was told "it's too late to run for Congress" when I launched. When someone told me I wasn’t qualified I resolved to put in the work. Every time someone told me not to run I resolved to run harder. https://t.co/QOJdyZLyFQ,2019-01-29 16:15:51,Twitter Web Client,77,281

If you want to help us send a message to Brandon Beach that we won't go back to "the way things were" in #GA06 chip in today and help us hold on to this seat:  Donate ➡️➡️ https://t.co/r2rLClYzWE,2019-01-25 16:59:29,Twitter Web Client,26,74
Brandon Beach has also supported legislation to allow students at state schools with concealed carry permits to bring firearms into classrooms.   We need to keep moving forward on common-sense solutions to gun violence prevention. Guns in classrooms are not a solution.,2019-01-25 16:53:01,Twitter Web Client,34,180
State Senator Brandon Beach has a record in Atlanta that is wrong for #GA06.   During his time in the state legislature he has supported limiting women's access to healthcare.,2019-01-25 16:51:19,Twitter Web Client,53,150
ICYMI: I already have at least one official 2020 opponent in #GA06. https://t.co/DdFSsTOkf0,2019-01-25 16:48:50,Twitter Web Client,51,227
The admiration is mutual @Emma4Change. My office door is always open to you (and everyone) working towards common-sense solutions for gun violence prevention. https://t.co/tJDeNaXrxP,2019-01-24 22:49:45,Twitter Web Client,203,2272
#GA06 sent me to Washington to provide new leadership. Will you chip in to be a founding member of my re-election campaign?
