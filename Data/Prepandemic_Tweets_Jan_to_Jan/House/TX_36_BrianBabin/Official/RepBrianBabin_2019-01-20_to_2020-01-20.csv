It’s official: The U.S. Space Force now has it’s first-ever Chief of Space Operations – General John “Jay” Raymond – an obvious choice!

How many times does Ambassador Sondland have to repeat that @realDonaldTrump never stated ANYTHING about wanting a quid pro quo?

As Amb.

This impeachment inquiry is a COMPLETE SHAM! House Dems continually mislead the public as they try to grasp at ANY straw they can reach to bring down @realDonaldTrump.

We need a safe lawful immigration system that secures the border and eliminates bad policies that encourage the breaking of our laws. Our current immigration policies incentivize cartels and migrants to game the system. It must be fixed! https://t.co/1XDk5RQS5M,2019-02-08 21:59:13,Twitter Web Client,6,10

We join @NASA in remembering the crews of Apollo 1 (Jan 27 1967) Challenger (Jan 28 1986) and Columbia (Feb 1 2003) who were lost while pushing the boundaries of space exploration.

I always enjoy being a part of @kfdmnews' Connect to Congress to give an update from our nation’s capital. We spoke about the State of the Union the crisis at our southern border the importance of a free economy and much more! https://t.co/BzgSO6axB3,2019-02-07 16:57:51,Twitter Web Client,0,3
State bills to expand abortions up to &amp; even AFTER birth is reprehensible. I stand w @SteveScalise &amp; @RepAnnWagner in forcing vote to ban. As Rep. Wagner said “this is the simplest vote you will ever take: either you support babies being killed after they are born or you don’t.”,2019-02-06 17:30:55,Twitter Web Client,78,300
In tonight’s #SOTU @POTUS discussed the progress weve made in 2 short years &amp; the challenges ahead we can overcome by “Choosing Greatness”. He laid out a plan to protect America’s workforce strengthen national security &amp; revive our aging infrastructure. https://t.co/9jn6Qwrg9a,2019-02-06 03:47:20,Twitter Web Client,5,18
“America is born free and we will stay free.” “America will never be a socialist country.” The American people stand firmly with @POTUS in condemning a system that has oppressed millions. Our government should protect our God-given rights not subjugate us. #SOTU,2019-02-06 03:14:19,Twitter for iPhone,5,31
It’s amazing at the progress we have made in two years in curbing North Korea’s nuclear program. Much work remains but excellent job so far by @POTUS. #SOTU https://t.co/VYSY9BpV0N,2019-02-06 03:10:14,Twitter for iPhone,2,7
@POTUS wants paid family leave so every family can bond with their newborn child. What a contrast with radical abortion policies of NY and VA Democrats! Thank you Mr. President for calling to end partial birth abortions. This will forever be a stain on our nation’s history. #SOTU,2019-02-06 03:05:38,Twitter for iPhone,3,13
I’m glad @POTUS and @GOP remain firmly committed to protect those with pre-existing conditions. As a health care provider I know how important this is to patients. But we need more free market solutions to bring down costs and expand treatment optional. #SOTU,2019-02-06 03:00:07,Twitter for iPhone,1,10
“The border agents will tell you where walls go up illegal crossings go way way down.” This is a commonsense principal most Dems agreed with before @POTUS was elected. #buildthebarrier #SOTU,2019-02-06 02:46:39,Twitter for iPhone,2,14
“Tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate. It’s actually very cruel.” @POTUS is right - we must enforce a legal immigration system to end violent coyote and gang exploitation of migrants and protect our own citizens. #SOTU,2019-02-06 02:39:29,Twitter for iPhone,1,23
“It’s time for Congress to show America is committed to ending illegal immigration.” @POTUS and the American people know border security is national security. 10 days left for Dems to compromise. Let’s get it done! #SOTU,2019-02-06 02:34:53,Twitter for iPhone,4,22
“The US is now the #1 producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world” and “a net exporter of energy.” @POTUS I’m proud that Houston TX is the energy capital of the US! #SOTU,2019-02-06 02:24:56,Twitter for iPhone,5,31
It’s great to see @POTUS recognize @TheRealBuzz at #SOTU. As the top Republican on @housesciencegop the past two Congresses I’ve benefited greatly from Buzz Aldrin’s friendship and wise counsel.,2019-02-06 02:19:06,Twitter for iPhone,0,9
Dems there's a simple solution to avoid emergency declaration - come to the negotiating table! We're asking for $5.7 billion out of a $trillion plus budget - less than 1/10 of 1%. How can you say this is money you can't find? This is national security! https://t.co/fV4XCG4EoB,2019-02-06 01:19:35,Twitter Web Client,6,18

Last week w/ bipartisan support in the House &amp; Senate I reintroduced the TAPS Act. I cannot thank Greg enough for his service to our country &amp; for his help on the TAPS Act &amp; I look forward to working with my colleagues to get this bill passed. https://t.co/i3zPgWizXx,2019-02-05 22:19:24,Twitter Web Client,0,3
I am proud that Greg Glod will be my guest at #SOTU. Greg served 26 years in Secret Service &amp; is an expert in threat assessment. After the Parkland tragedy Greg contacted me w/ a plan to prevent attacks in our schools and communities which led to my introduction of the TAPS Act.,2019-02-05 22:19:24,Twitter Web Client,3,11
6) Revitalizing American space program: @POTUS has sought renewed mission for @NASA &amp; space program. @NASA_Johnson Space Center will play vital role in US reclaiming sole leadership in space exploration. We want to return to the moon - to stay - and go to Mars. @housesciencegop,2019-02-05 20:27:49,Twitter Web Client,0,6
5) Rebuilding American infrastructure: @POTUS wants to continue rebuilding infrastructure to move people &amp; goods. On @TransportGOP Cmte we want to work with Dems on highway bill but some freshman Dems say no bill without unrelated climate change provisions. Let's be bipartisan!,2019-02-05 20:27:49,Twitter Web Client,2,6
4) Protecting American workers: strong workforce is crucial for continued economic growth. @GOP plan: empower individuals &amp; businesses to boost wages. We've sent msg we'll protect our trade interests. Dems push policies to hollow out workforce increase federal dependence.,2019-02-05 20:27:48,Twitter Web Client,0,3
3) Healthcare &amp; prescriptions: @GOPHouse passed reforms last year to lower prescription drug prices for Americans needing medical care. Dems have refused to replace/improve Obamacare even as healthcare costs ⬆️ &amp; options ⬇️. Will #SOTU present next steps? Dems come to the table!,2019-02-05 20:27:48,Twitter Web Client,0,3
2) National security: @POTUS is pursuing foreign policy that protects Americans and our interests 1st &amp; foremost. How will we continue pursuing our long-term interests while honoring commitments &amp; protecting allies? We've made progress in Afghanistan Venezuela &amp; North Korea.,2019-02-05 20:27:48,Twitter Web Client,0,4
1) Border security &amp; immigration: This affects every congressional district in the US - critically important! We need immigration policies that benefit American people's interest. It all starts with securing border. @POTUS has been willing to compromise but so far Dems have not.,2019-02-05 20:27:48,Twitter Web Client,0,4
I'm excited @POTUS will speak about "Choosing Greatness" in tonight's #SOTU. Our economy is strong but we can do so much more if we decide to come together and advance an agenda in the best interests of the American people.

Thank you @ndaajustice ! The TAPS Act has been a priority for me since introducing it last year &amp; I'm excited to have bipartisan support in both the House &amp; Senate this year.

My new Democrat colleague believes increasing taxes on many Americans up to 90% would be “a place we can start.” If something that radical is only the beginning I’m afraid to hear what she envisions our nation looking like after Dems are done with it.https://t.co/zjjraErMEz,2019-02-01 22:20:04,Twitter Web Client,6,13

I'm outraged &amp; heartbroken that our country has allowed the killing of 61M unborn babies.

Not only has Democratic leadership REFUSED to negotiate to end shutdown but now their entire caucus has voted TWICE against paying federal workers. @POTUS has offered compromise plan. Republicans in House &amp; Senate are ready to negotiate. Nancy? Come to the table! Let's end this! https://t.co/g33bv4tBV1,2019-01-23 22:28:44,Twitter Web Client,32,80
I had to double take when I saw this. Chuck &amp; Nancy have insisted for weeks Dems won’t negotiate but I'm hopeful internal pressure on Dem leadership will lead them to the table. We have to compromise to secure our border &amp; get everyone back to work! https://t.co/GJbKFqSubJ,2019-01-23 00:13:28,Twitter Web Client,14,33
