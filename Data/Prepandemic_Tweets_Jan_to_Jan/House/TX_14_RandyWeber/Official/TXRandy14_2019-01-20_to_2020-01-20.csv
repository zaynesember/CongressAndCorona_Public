America has a long history of leadership in nuclear science. It's critical we maintain that leadership. My thanks to @SecretaryPerry for committing to construct this facility. Today’s announcement is another landmark moment in this journey! https://t.co/qGfABwNZ3g,2019-02-28 21:57:54,Twitter Web Client,3,17
Senate D’s kill (interesting word) the Born-Alive Survivors Protection Act. Barbaric! Even on battlefield with worst enemies if we take a wounded prisoner: don’t we give medical treatment to save them? But we won’t save innocent babies who survived attemps to kill them?

I’m 65 &amp; love America. In all my years I’ve never heard so much talk of Socialism. Everday countless mice die because they don’t understand why the cheese is “free.” More folks get into &amp; suffer &amp; die in Socialism for same reason. Those wanting “free cheese” better wake up!,2019-02-15 14:16:27,Twitter for iPhone,4,26
I’ve been thinking: If Donald Trump deleted all of his emails wiped his server with Bleach bit and destroyed all of his phones with a hammer would the Mainstream Media suddenly lose all interest in the story and declare him innocent? 🤔 Probably not. They hate him so bad!...rw,2019-02-13 21:21:59,Twitter for iPhone,9,29

Let me understand. Certain D’s (some of who believe the world could end in 12 years) think that we must go to all green energy regardless of the cost. Apparently they think “the sky’s the limit!” No wait even the sky is off limit as in no airplanes. Can’t make this stuff up..rw,2019-02-13 18:31:20,Twitter for iPhone,1,7
Here at the rally with other congressmen! There are huge crowds of people here and they are excited about helping President Trump make America great again. About securing our border for safety for our families. And about helping people to immigrate the legal way. Love it! #MAGA,2019-02-12 01:23:49,Twitter for iPhone,1,19
Saddened by the passing of my colleague Walter Jones. He faithfully served the people of North Carolina &amp; he cared for our military men &amp; women with fierce loyalty.

The 75th anniversary of D-Day is coming up in June. Those brave young soldiers knew their cause they knew who they were there to help. Their story is one of courage and bravery. POTUS is right…They knew America had to prevail. Good always triumphs over evil.,2019-02-06 03:25:34,Twitter Web Client,1,6

Dems can’t even clap for the idea of being born free and founded on liberty and independence? That we will never be a socialist country? Hmm…,2019-02-06 03:10:34,Twitter Web Client,4,24

American freedom has allowed for scientific advances in HIV/AIDS childhood cancer &amp; more. We will not stop until these diseases are eliminated.

Humanitarian assistance… more law enforcement…drug detection at ports of entry…closing of loopholes…plans for new physical barriers… all of these are common sense measures we’ve all agreed on in the past. What’s so different now? #SOTU,2019-02-06 02:44:52,Twitter Web Client,2,7

Sec. Nielsen announced today 2000 migrants arrived in yet another caravan…their plan is to enter the border into Texas. This is unacceptable. POTUS hits the nail on the head with his assessment of our immigration crisis.,2019-02-06 02:39:50,Twitter Web Client,4,6

Trump is doing what the Constitution requires him to do as 1 of his primary responsibilities: keep Americans safe. He has offered help on DACA front for 3 years. Yet D’s refuse. How many more Americans must die at hands of illegal/criminals before D’s care? #DemsWakeUp,2019-01-20 19:25:17,Twitter for iPhone,1,19
