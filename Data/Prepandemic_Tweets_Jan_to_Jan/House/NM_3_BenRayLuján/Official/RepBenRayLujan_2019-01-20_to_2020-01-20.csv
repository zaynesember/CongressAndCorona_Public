It’s disappointing that as Congress moved forward with a compromise today the President insisted on declaring a national emergency because he didn’t get his way.

We’ve seen tremendous progress around #MedicaidBuyIn in New Mexico. @NMRepArmstrong &amp; Sen.

The State Public Option Act also increases affordability. This bill fixes the family glitch making more middle class families eligible for tax credits. People can then take their tax credits and buy a Medicaid plan so no parent has to choose between rent and a doctor’s visit.,2019-02-14 22:55:43,Twitter Web Client,4,17
The State Public Option Act strengthens the ACA by enabling states to sell Medicaid plans on the exchanges. Does your state have too few plans? Do you worry about your county not having coverage? #MedicaidBuyIn increases competition and decreases cost.,2019-02-14 22:55:43,Twitter Web Client,3,18
Our State Public Option Act gives states the ability to remove income requirements from Medicaid so anyone can buy a plan. It’s a public option. I’ve supported the public option since I was voting on the ACA in 2010 because I believe that health care is a right not a privilege.,2019-02-14 22:55:43,Twitter Web Client,5,19

When it comes to infrastructure investments the President can’t just talk the talk tonight he needs to walk the walk. We need comprehensive investments in our roads bridges and broadband infrastructure to meet the demands of our 21st-century economy. #SOTU,2019-02-06 02:53:52,Twitter Web Client,10,10
We must implement trade policies that protect American workers &amp; generate economic growth at home. It is critical that the President consider trade agreements &amp; policies that not only benefit workers and consumers but also the environment. #SOTU,2019-02-06 02:52:06,Twitter Web Client,4,7
New Mexico benefits from international trade when it strengthens our economy.

It’s unbelievable that President Trump continues to demand his 5th-century border wall. @HouseDemocrats support a modern and effective approach to border security including investing in smart infrastructure and technology. #SOTU,2019-02-06 02:43:51,Twitter Web Client,11,33
Despite the President’s inflammatory rhetoric people coming to the United States seeking a better life are not a problem to be solved. Immigrants refugees and asylees make our communities more vibrant and our economy stronger. #SOTU,2019-02-06 02:38:33,Twitter Web Client,25,88
The President has repeatedly chosen to stoke fear rather than come to the negotiating table to discuss the modern and effective border security strategies that Democrats have laid out. #SOTU,2019-02-06 02:33:40,Twitter Web Client,24,63
President Trump's attempts to undercut the Special Counsel's investigation are unacceptable. Robert Mueller must be allowed to complete his work without obstruction. #SOTU,2019-02-06 02:24:56,Twitter Web Client,10,45
