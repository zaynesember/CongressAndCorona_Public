Every year hundreds of New Mexicans die from preventable gun violence.  I'm proud to be endorsed by @bradybuzz because solving the gun violence epidemic is a moral responsibility.

Sarah Pitlyk would be a danger to have on the bench. I’m running for Senate to stand up to Mitch McConnell and stop the GOP’s dangerous judicial picks. Say it with me: no anti-choice judges.,2019-10-28 21:43:15,Twitter Web App,9,15
During her career Sarah Pitlyk has also attacked in-vitro fertilization &amp; surrogacy joined lawyers in the Hobby Lobby case to oppose the ACA’s contraception mandate &amp; falsely claimed that abortion and birth control are based in the eugenics movement.  https://t.co/zDvuEBX9r0,2019-10-28 21:43:15,Twitter Web App,9,12

Sarah Pitlyk is one of five Trump judicial nominees deemed “not qualified” by the ABA.

Menashi has also written in defense of bigoted chants against Native communities and defended Islamophobes and racists. He is 40 years old and his confirmation would mean decades on the bench.  https://t.co/wYUm8Y2txq,2019-10-23 18:26:45,Twitter Web App,1,2
Steven Menashi’s radical anti-abortion beliefs are wildly out-of-touch with the American public.

Let me be clear: Democrats’ bill to end Trump’s national emergency passed with BIPARTISAN support.  But he used his very first veto to override the will of the people.
