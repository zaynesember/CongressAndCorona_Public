@ColinParent @RachelLaing @mapintar @msmayarosas @Mike2020 @TransitCenter But GND is very general and does not mention land use bikes or ped. And it’s a non binding resolution.

@andy_keatts @dillonliam @jemersmith @BobbyCharette_ No - housing needs both reforms and they’re different. In SB50 the state would force local upzoning. CEQA reform should withdraw the ability to sue to stop individual projects consistent with that zoning. Two different and critical #YIMBY moves.,2019-11-04 15:41:03,Twitter for iPhone,1,4
@andy_keatts @dillonliam @jemersmith @BobbyCharette_ But better if a general plan and zoning code have been adopted by a city and that plan and zoning code have been fully vetted under CEQA - including potentially litigation - then there could be no CEQA lawsuit against an individual project under that code.

Maybe do a full financing plan for local climate action to put these trade offs and risks in context. Most of the locals are studying CCA without having committed. Before they do let’s answer these hard questions. //,2019-04-10 18:57:21,Twitter for iPhone,0,5
In contrast locals may not be good at buying power. It’s hard enough to provide the muni basics - look at SD water billing - but at least cities have decades of experience. Overconfidence in public agency energy market mastery is a risk here. 10/,2019-04-10 18:57:19,Twitter for iPhone,0,8
Ironically SDG&amp;E is the greenest utility in the US with 45% renewable power (added to another 10% in the region from distributed solar). It’s expensive to be an early adopter but state-regulated rates should reflect lower renewable costs over time. 9/,2019-04-10 18:57:17,Twitter for iPhone,0,4
Post SB100 we don’t need to encumber government credit for clean power. And a JPA does not protect the balance sheet because no bank will lend to a JPA for new power construction projects without guarantees from the member agencies. 8/,2019-04-10 18:57:15,Twitter for iPhone,1,3
We need a financing plan for the expensive local climate action we cannot and must not avoid on transportation and resiliency — bikes transit road diets sea level rise water supply fire safety.  Our borrowing capacity is limited. 7/,2019-04-10 18:57:13,Twitter for iPhone,1,3
I might feel differently about CCA if the state had not (heroically) passed SB100 requiring statewide energy carbon neutrality by 2045. Our power will be clean without local government action. 6/,2019-04-10 18:57:12,Twitter for iPhone,1,3
This happened in the 1990s - the County bought a $135M waste-to-energy plant without commitments from customers. When the plant cost was added to the disposal fees the fees went up and the customers left. Taxpayers ate the cost of the “NCRRA” plant which ultimately closed. 5/,2019-04-10 18:57:11,Twitter for iPhone,0,3
But even with competition customers leaving CCA is not good. Imagine us signing multi-million dollar public energy contracts customers bailing and general funds having to prevent default. That puts basic services on the hook. 4/,2019-04-10 18:57:10,Twitter for iPhone,0,3
Remember how an original selling point was competition- that if SDG&amp;E was cheaper consumers would have a choice?  Now SDG&amp;E is trying to get out leaving another monopoly in its place. 3/,2019-04-10 18:57:10,Twitter for iPhone,0,3
When local governments add admin costs and profits (listen to folks celebrate the government revenue this will bring) to the cost of our power it’s hard to imagine how this will be cheaper for ratepayers. And as far as I know PUC won’t regulate these rates. 2/,2019-04-10 18:57:09,Twitter for iPhone,0,3
Power procurement is the part of SDG&amp;E’s business it wants to unload because regulators prevent them from charging more than cost. No profit!
