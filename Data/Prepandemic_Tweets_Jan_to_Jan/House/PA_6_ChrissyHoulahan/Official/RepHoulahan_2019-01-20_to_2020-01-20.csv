I do not believe a monolithic continuous border wall is efficient or effective. We cannot let our government be shutdown again as a negotiating tactic over any policy difference and I was concerned that the President did not appear to rule out another government shutdown. 4/,2019-02-06 05:10:39,Twitter Web Client,4,12

We cannot let this happen again and the #SEASAct will appropriately put the pain in situations like these on the Executive and Legislative branches rather than on the people that we serve. #NoMoreShutdowns 2/2  Read more here: https://t.co/9NabuQWG0S,2019-01-30 19:36:34,Twitter Web Client,14,22
Intentionally shutting the government down to negotiate policy differences is irresponsible and failed policy.

Pleased that the President has agreed to reopen the govt for 3 weeks and get our fed workers repaid. We now must come together to find a bipartisan solution to secure our borders &amp; keep our government funded. Shutdown is failed policy.
