Common frustration I heard at my town hall this week: quit the partisan games and get to work on meaningful issues. @SpeakerPelosi bring USMCA up for a vote instead of endlessly investigating @realDonaldTrump.

Speaker Pelosi is letting the tail wag the dog. Imagine what Congress could accomplish if Democrats put this kind of effort into passing a budget or securing our border. 4/4,2019-09-24 23:05:03,Twitter Web App,13,97
President Trump has already said he would voluntarily release the transcript of his call. Worse the Democrats were silent when Vice President Biden and President Obama did exactly the same thing they’re accusing President Trump of. 3/4,2019-09-24 23:05:03,Twitter Web App,9,83
No matter what Speaker Pelosi and ‘the Squad’ say there are no grounds for impeachment and all the uproar about the President’s call with Ukrainian President Zelensky is both premature and hypocritical. 2/4,2019-09-24 23:05:02,Twitter Web App,11,62
I do not support the Democrats’ efforts to impeach @realDonaldTrump and undermine his presidency. I am not surprised with Speaker Pelosi’s decision to give-in to ‘the Squad’ and the far left. 1/4,2019-09-24 23:05:02,Twitter Web App,67,349

I voted no on today’s continuing resolution.

It’s unfortunate Congress couldn’t act to secure our border and that the President has been forced to declare a national emergency due to this inaction.
