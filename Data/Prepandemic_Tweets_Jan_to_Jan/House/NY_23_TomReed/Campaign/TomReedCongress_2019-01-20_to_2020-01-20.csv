I voted NO. I pride myself on being open and willing to work across the aisle when necessary. But I have found these impeachment proceedings to be completely partisan and yet another attempt to overturn the results of the 2016 election.,2019-12-19 01:37:03,Twitter Web App,2,19
A great win for #NY23. Even in the midst of so many partisan distractions we can still work together to solve problems.  https://t.co/FWH1C88p20,2019-12-16 17:54:55,Twitter Web App,2,2

Not an April Fools' joke: @NYGovCuomo is giving himself a $50k pay raise.   This is unfair to the hardworking New Yorkers who struggle to make ends meet under the Governor's oppressive tax and spend regime.  https://t.co/534S6qKO0V,2019-04-01 20:50:57,Twitter Web Client,13,12

H.R. 1 is called the "For the People Act" but that couldn't be further from reality. The truth is this extreme proposal will send your tax dollars to political campaigns you may not agree with while causing the deficit to balloon. #NOTforthePeopleAct,2019-03-06 18:22:40,Twitter Web Client,12,13
As the youngest of 12 siblings raised by a single mom on a Social Security check it is an honor to be named the Republican Leader of the Social Security Subcommittee.
