#OTD three years ago #SCOTUS struck down abortion restrictions in Texas. Today the fight to protect women’s health including TRANS WOMEN is more important than ever especially the health of our most vulnerable communities in #NY7. https://t.co/iwnHol543e,2019-06-27 18:32:00,TweetDeck,4,9
Earlier this year the House passed the #ForthePeopleAct. I call on the Senate to take up and approve this measure. We must ensure all Americans' voices are heard not marginalized!  #RightToVote,2019-06-27 15:56:32,Twitter Web Client,6,16
Now the drawing of district lines to benefit a particular party will become more common throughout the country underscoring the need for federal legislative reform.,2019-06-27 15:56:32,Twitter Web Client,3,11
Rather than reining in partisan #gerrymandering #SCOTUS has opened the flood gates to district lines benefiting parties NOT people.  https://t.co/as103udHPA,2019-06-27 15:56:31,Twitter Web Client,7,14
I'm relieved that SCOTUS has for now prevented a citizenship question from being inserted into #2020Census. Such a question was a brazen political attempt to suppress participation. We'll be watching carefully to see how this goes forward but this is a positive ruling today!,2019-06-27 15:49:27,Twitter Web Client,5,21
A loophole in fed'l law has let unscrupulous lenders swindle small businesses out of their life savings. As Chair of @HouseSmallBiz Committee I'm working on bipartisan legislation to fix this problem and protect small businesses from predatory lenders. https://t.co/6ZaZ0s9G4g,2019-06-27 14:10:45,Twitter Web Client,22,44

We need a leader in the Senate who fights #ForThePeople by passing bills that have the American people’s interests in mind - not special interest groups. #McConnellGraveyard,2019-06-26 19:30:00,TweetDeck,6,20
.@SenateMajLdr’s refusal to bring House passed legislation to the Senate floor prevents our nation from solving the issues hard working Americans want addressed like: gun violence high prescription drug costs &amp; pay inequality. #McConnellGraveyard,2019-06-26 17:45:00,TweetDeck,6,12
Since the #MuellerReport top intelligence and national security officials have warned us that the foreign interference in the 2016 elections could pale in comparison to the threats we face in 2020. @HouseDemocrats are doing something about it. #SAFEAct #ProtectOurDemocracy https://t.co/vXDYtOjCVJ,2019-06-26 17:35:00,TweetDeck,4,13
I’ve seen this photo circulating for two days. As hard as it is to look this is our nation's fault. The limp arm of the daughter clinging to her father is because of us. The water that filled their lungs is because of us.   We must do better   https://t.co/E1GSPnwEp6,2019-06-26 16:50:48,Twitter Web Client,22,66
