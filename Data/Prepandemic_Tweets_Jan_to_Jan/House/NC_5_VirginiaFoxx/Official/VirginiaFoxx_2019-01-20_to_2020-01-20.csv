This week in a fleeting moment of bipartisanship the House voted to consider my legislation to take spending off autopilot. Amid the partisan caps bill put forth and then pulled by @HouseDemocrats I was pleased my Spending Safeguard Amendment was accepted for debate. (2/4),2019-04-10 20:34:23,Twitter Web Client,0,6
Unchecked spending is the main driver of our national debt and by 2028 it will constitute a whopping 15% of our GDP. This is simply unsustainable. Yet there are no commonsense safeguards to rein in spending beyond our budget. (1/4),2019-04-10 20:33:44,Twitter Web Client,0,12

BREAKING → Senate #DemsDuck 🦆 their own #GreenNewDeal. House Dems have been ducking open debate ever since it was introduced.

Dems continue to run but they're not hiding their disregard for newborn life from the American people. They just rejected the request I made to consider the #BornAliveAct by unanimous consent for the 20th time denying abortion survivors the #RightToLife. #EndInfanticide,2019-03-26 20:25:25,Twitter Web Client,175,522

After nearly two years of investigation it's no surprise to learn that Special Counsel Mueller’s robust investigation has definitively shown that there was no collusion by @POTUS or his campaign w/ Russia.

#HRes183 rightfully condemns anti-Semitism and hate. Last week Dems could've said it was an urgent response to @IlhanMN’s anti-Semitic claim that Israel's supporters have allegiance to a foreign country. They instead dragged their feet and now disregard the legislative process.,2019-03-07 21:27:50,Twitter Web Client,6,18
Hypocrisy 🚨: MINUTES ago @HouseDemocrats introduced a resolution (for the 2nd time today) that we will be voting on this evening.

Do you want your tax dollars being spent on political campaigns? House Dems' #HR1 would require the gov't to match political donations for presidential candidates dollar for dollar up to $250 MILLION. No limit on donations.

It is appalling and indefensible that in the name of “choice” leaders in our country now support infanticide but Republicans are prepared to continue leading the charge to support mothers with life-affirming options and uphold human dignity at every stage of life.

At the same time woefully misguided opponents are saying that “no one truly wants to abort a baby late in pregnancy.” If that is the case then why are Dems lock-step in their denial of medical care to the children who against all odds have a fighting chance of survival?

Watching the Senate vote against the motion to proceed on the Born-Alive Abortion Survivor Protection Act today was absolutely heart-breaking. This bill is about protecting newborn life—life that is viable outside the womb. It does nothing to change Roe v. Wade. (1/3),2019-02-25 23:41:40,TweetDeck,138,325
