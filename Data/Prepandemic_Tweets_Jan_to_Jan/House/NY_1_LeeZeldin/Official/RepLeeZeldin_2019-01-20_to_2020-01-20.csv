Dems have a new word of the day: “extortion”. The shiny object of “quid pro quo” totally fell apart on them.

Star witness? Taylor said in depo he believed reason POTUS wanted Ukraine to investigate Ukrainians' interference w/ the 2016 election &amp; Burisma was just to get dirt on Biden.

Fun fact from Yovanovitch transcript just released: No 1st hand info of quid pro quo linking new investigation in return for US aid although at end of depo in response to my ?s she tried citing Bill Taylor’s 2nd/3rd/4th hand info as her sole basis before she walked that back.,2019-11-05 04:11:55,Twitter for iPhone,2479,5457
and when I asked her why the House Dem staffer was reaching out to her Yovanovitch suggested maybe the outreach was just "to catch up".

Interesting take.

In fact all of these decisions are left to Schiff who – under this partisan reso – has the power to veto whatever he wants.

Pres Trump was not happy about any of this knew better than anyone that it was all BS &amp; wanted nothing more than to save our country from this insanity.

Mueller knew before the 2018 midterm election that President Trump didn't collude with the Russians to win the presidency but withheld that info until after the 2018 election when the House flipped from Republican to Democrat.

It was obvious a LONG time ago that President Trump didn't collude with the Russians to win the 2016 election but the DOJ/FBI refused to get rid of that cloud; in fact they only recklessly added to it. Dems &amp; media eagerly played along.,2019-06-01 11:27:48,Twitter Web Client,108,372

In Jan House Dems raced to the House floor tripping over each other to condemn White Supremacy; a nearly unanimous vote. Why won't @HouseDemocrats also call out hate in their own ranks &amp; #PassHRes72? Instead they empower/elevate it. @SpeakerPelosi...SPEAK! https://t.co/ZtfwtILpcL,2019-02-05 02:44:17,Twitter Media Studio,1930,5269
.@jdforward This person calls me “Nazi-supporting” &amp; you’re going to play along promoting this person’s eager attack on a Jewish Member of Congress? You call yourself a Jewish newspaper?

It’s an honor to invite @SCPDHq Commissioner Geraldine Hart to be my guest at the State of the Union address on Tuesday. She has proven her corruption-busting crime-stopping reputation at the @FBI &amp; it has been an honor to work w/ her as Suffolk County Police Commissioner.,2019-02-03 22:27:04,Twitter Web App,44,222
BDS was founded by someone blatantly anti-Semitic. It has evolved at U.S. colleges into Jewish students being targeted w blatant anti-Semitism. Anyone claiming this is just all about reasonable criticism of a gov't is either lying to themselves or lying to the rest of us. https://t.co/y4YVYPnCfF,2019-02-03 18:34:56,Twitter Media Studio,972,2026
If @SpeakerPelosi @HouseDemocrats brought to the floor a robust border security package w increased $ to harden our physical barrier &amp; other related security items it would pass strongly &amp; the vote wouldn’t even be close. Lets vote! Time to vote!,2019-02-03 15:21:47,Twitter for iPhone,240,800
Apparently criticizing a Member of Congress for advocating pro-leniency of ISIS fighters pro-BDS anti-Israel pro-Maduro pro-90% tax rate is Islamophobic &amp; racist even if that Member's religion/race aren’t even raised. That disgusting spin coming from the left now is SO WRONG!,2019-02-03 03:58:16,Twitter for iPhone,5951,18146
Northam guilty on Thurs of promoting infanticide. Guilty on Fri of associating w horrible racism &amp; bigotry. W this press conference now he’s guilty of lying w a straight face.

House Dems were falling over each other racing to House floor to vote against White Supremacy in Jan. Only 1 NO vote in House but now House Dems are denying a vote to condemn anti-Israel &amp; anti-Semitic hate. 🤔@SpeakerPelosi #PassHRes72 &amp; condemn this hate as well. Let’s vote!,2019-02-02 03:43:18,Twitter for iPhone,1942,4393
I’ll meet w/any colleague GOP/Dem to discuss anything but w/out apology I'll NEVER stand by while Members advocate pro-BDS anti-Israel hate leniency for ISIS fighters prop up Maduro in Venezuela &amp; now a 90% income tax rate. Not on my watch. #PassHRes72 https://t.co/dj6LYxzOLJ,2019-02-01 18:42:22,Twitter for iPhone,463,1225
This week @HouseDemocrats @SpeakerPelosi should allow a vote to #PassHRes72 to condemn anti-Israel &amp; anti-Semitic hatred infiltrating US politics college campuses &amp; the halls of Congress. Confront it head on! This hate must not be elevated or empowered. It must be crushed.,2019-02-01 13:43:22,Twitter for iPhone,998,2685
Let’s do that! Are you saying you disagree w/everything said in that voicemail? I sure do &amp; it would be great if you did as well &amp; cosponsored &amp; helped #PassHRes72. That would be a step in the right direction. https://t.co/RYIqDN5Mby,2019-02-01 05:16:34,Twitter for iPhone,1474,4991

I've witnessed life in the 2nd trimester when my daughters were born in the 25th week. Now they are 12 smart healthy &amp; beautiful. Legalizing late term partial birth abortions right up to the point of labor at week 40 is so horribly wrong on so many levels. https://t.co/Q54r2yRI6I,2019-01-31 15:30:21,Twitter Web Client,916,2467
Those poor innocent ISIS fighters &amp; Palestinian terrorists right? Give me a break! That’s a problem no matter your religion or gender Ilhan. Your anti-Semitic &amp; anti-Israel hate is strong &amp; wrong &amp; those terrorists have US blood on their hands as well. https://t.co/yVmS6Tdd8T,2019-01-31 04:05:14,Twitter for iPhone,5951,17340
TY to @SteveScalise for cosponsoring my Reso today condemning the anti-Israel &amp; anti-Semitic hatred infiltrating US politics college campuses &amp; the halls of Congress. @SpeakerPelosi was quick to call out White Supremacy.

The entire House of Reps all GOP &amp; all Dems must reject the anti-Israel &amp; anti-Semitic hatred infiltrating US politics college campuses &amp; the halls of Congress.

My New York values are to expand access to college aid for legal NYers who can't afford college &amp; Cuomo's New York values are to deprive those students I'm fighting for of expanded opportunities to give that limited pot of $ to people not here legally which is so wrong.,2019-01-27 22:53:14,Twitter for iPhone,171,696
I'm unapologetically anti illegal immigration &amp; pro legal immigration. It would be great if Cuomo found an ounce of integrity to admit he's pro illegal immigration rather than conflating it all &amp; simply saying he is pro-immigration which couldn't be more deliberately misleading.,2019-01-27 22:49:58,Twitter for iPhone,664,2150
There are hard working middle income NY taxpayers who can't afford to send their child to college bc they don't qualify for free tuition $.

Gov. Cuomo's blatant pandering to the extreme left of Dem Party &amp; utter disregard for the rule of law is becoming more &amp; more evident by the day.

A vote should be scheduled in the House this week on my reso to condemn the anti-Israel &amp; anti-Semitic hatred that is currently infiltrating U.S. politics &amp; the halls of Congress.

NY just passed a new law giving free college to illegal immigrants.

The House Reso (H.Res.72) to condemn Louis Farrakhan Tamika Mallory Linda Sarsour &amp; their enablers in Congress for the anti-Israel &amp; anti-Semitic hatred infiltrating American politics &amp; the halls of Congress adds the key public support of @GOPLeader! https://t.co/Ikgs2YUBNh,2019-01-25 23:53:00,Twitter for iPhone,207,464

Between canceling the SOTU sending Members home from DC so much this month &amp; only accepting compromise that gets her 100% of what she wants Pelosi has a long way to go to truly be Speaker of the entire House instead of Speaker of the Radical Left.,2019-01-25 21:53:47,Twitter Web Client,399,1210

There's no good excuse stopping @SpeakerPelosi from releasing the hostages &amp; passing a bill now that pays our federal workers.

Unbelievable. @SpeakerPelosi just canceled session for Friday &amp; is putting the House in recess from tomorrow morning until Monday evening. Stop leaving DC! Sit down negotiate &amp; compromise.

I'm filing Reso today rejecting the anti-Israel anti-Semitic hatred creeping into our politics &amp; Congress. The Speaker had vote last week to reject White Supremacy. Anti-Israel anti-Semitic hatred should also be rooted out on a bipartisan basis.,2019-01-23 19:24:33,Twitter for Advertisers (legacy),399,855
As Farrakhan etc spew anti-Israel anti-Semitic hate many Reps. have embraced/echoed them. Last week the House voted to reject White Supremacy.

Good for @LeaderHoyer showing independence from @SpeakerPelosi just now on @TeamCavuto.
