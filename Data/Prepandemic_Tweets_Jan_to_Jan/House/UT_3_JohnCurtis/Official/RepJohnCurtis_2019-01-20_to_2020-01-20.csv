If my colleagues truly want to achieve progress on this issue I hope theyll recognize that they have a willing partner in me—but they must be willing to work together to legislate &amp; make room to protect both religious liberty &amp; the LGBTQ community. #utpol https://t.co/O72AhHD2lm,2019-05-16 16:44:32,Twitter Web Client,0,10
We face a unique challenge of balancing needed protections for the LGBTQ community w/the importance of protecting religious liberty. The #EqualityAct fails to strike that balance instead treating these two interests as a zero-sum game with no effort to allow both sides to win. https://t.co/Ql2QFatQ3c,2019-05-16 16:39:16,Twitter Web Client,2,18
