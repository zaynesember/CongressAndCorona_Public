Outrageous. This was a shameless admission of guilt directly from the Acting @WhiteHouse Chief of Staff that Trump withheld support to Ukraine to pressure them into doing what was good for Donald Trump personally — not what was in America’s national security interest. https://t.co/FR1jZYcBYR,2019-10-18 13:34:12,Twitter for iPhone,15,57

Let's not forget what this impeachment inquiry is about:  President Trump abused his power by pressuring a foreign country to interfere in the 2020 election. He put his own personal political gain above his oath of office to the American people. He must be held accountable. https://t.co/7OxW8R7Uvi,2019-10-17 19:46:00,TweetDeck,19,55

Eugene Scalia’s record disqualifies him from serving as Secretary of Labor. Thank you @RepAndyLevin for leading this letter to the President. https://t.co/ifLAHw6CRe,2019-08-09 03:35:41,Twitter for iPhone,55,79
We must support and protect the brave Guatemalan lawyers investigators judges and the @CC_Guatemala as they carry on the fight against corruption and impunity.,2019-08-09 00:09:02,Twitter for iPhone,47,110
The @CICIGgt was forced to shut down by the current corrupt Guatemalan Government &amp; the cowardly withdrawal of US support.   Here’s my full statement from earlier this year: https://t.co/pmwRDHEDMc,2019-08-09 00:09:02,Twitter for iPhone,86,137
Grateful to meet today with the courageous staff of @CICIGgt who for 12 years prosecuted corruption and human rights crimes in #Guatemala.   There can be no security and no democracy without justice. https://t.co/lB1zkN5lZl,2019-08-09 00:09:01,Twitter for iPhone,127,419
The violence and poverty in Central America has been exacerbated by America's own history of intervention and destabilization. And often our debate on immigration is totally removed from this simple reality. Here's my new op-ed on why that has to change: https://t.co/YaEpuSAuOf,2019-08-08 17:01:47,Twitter Web App,45,92
NEWS: I am traveling with @SpeakerPelosi to Guatemala El Salvador Honduras and McAllen Texas.   It is important for the United States to understand the violence that drives migrants north and how we help empower people to create opportunity and combat corruption at home. https://t.co/YZofv1sUZw,2019-08-08 17:01:46,Twitter Web App,72,297
Yesterday I went on @RadioBoston to say that Mitch McConnell needs to immediately call the Senate back into session to vote on the commonsense gun safety bills that the House has already passed and that an overwhelming majority of Americans support. https://t.co/tlwfYh7bP0,2019-08-07 13:39:26,Twitter Web App,11,65
So many people have given their blood sweat and tears to ensure that every citizen can cast a ballot. This is why  @HouseDemocrats  have passed bills to make it easier to vote stop voter suppression and fight back against foreign interference.   This is what's at stake. https://t.co/xwVN2XiVXf,2019-08-06 21:54:33,Twitter Web App,25,72
Thank you for speaking out President @BarackObama.  https://t.co/jfmtHmqAZ7,2019-08-06 21:30:19,Twitter Web App,20,88
3/ This is immoral. The only pro-#HumanRights solution to the #Venezuela crisis is to negotiate. Today’s action makes that harder and I condemn it.,2019-08-06 18:59:37,Twitter Web App,7,20
2/ @NicolasMaduro has been accused of using food for political control.   But it’s inevitable that Trump’s embargo will further reduce access to basic needs on a massive scale and increase the suffering of the Venezuelan people in the name of supporting @jguaido.,2019-08-06 18:59:37,Twitter Web App,6,15
1/ Today @realDonaldTrump is doubling down on a failed policy to force regime change in #Venezuela by imposing an embargo that will destroy what’s left of the country’s economy and cause millions more to flee. https://t.co/Rorr2jnATd,2019-08-06 18:59:37,Twitter Web App,9,16

Words matter. The domestic terror attack in El Paso was targeted at Hispanic Americans &amp; inspired by the racism and white supremacy of the president.  Let’s tell the truth. One of the biggest national security threats in our country is the current resident of the White House.,2019-08-04 14:33:03,Twitter for iPhone,6456,21276
In May Trump said we are being “invaded” by immigrants. The El Paso shooter said he wanted to stop the “invasion.”  Trump asked his rally crowd: "How do you stop these people" from crossing the border?  "Shoot them!" Someone screamed.  He laughed. Then the crowd laughed.,2019-08-04 14:33:02,Twitter for iPhone,60201,138060
Filled with sadness &amp; anger after waking up to another mass shooting. Our prayers are with the victims &amp; their loved ones in #Dayton.  But the American people didn’t elect us to tweet. They elected us to act. We need commonsense laws to prevent #GunViolence right now! https://t.co/4Lnm4cQsw5,2019-08-04 13:47:47,Twitter for iPhone,46,159
My heart breaks for El Paso. Another terrible senseless act of gun violence. We cannot allow this to become normal. And we need more than thoughts and prayers. We need action. https://t.co/n2mah8bh2h,2019-08-03 23:14:02,Twitter for iPhone,17,79
5/ Instead we should be working to eliminate these awful weapons from all countries so that humanity no longer has to live with the possibility of global annihilation at our own hands.,2019-08-02 23:21:23,Twitter for iPhone,7,31
4/ I am deeply deeply concerned that this move puts the US &amp; the entire world back on a reckless and unrestrained trajectory towards nuclear proliferation.,2019-08-02 23:21:22,Twitter for iPhone,6,28
3/ Today President Trump let the INF Treaty expire.   Was Russia in violation of this treaty? Yes.   Did the United States do our job to hold them accountable or get them into compliance? No.,2019-08-02 23:21:22,Twitter for iPhone,1,6
2/ At its core is the idea that both sides must understand the impossibility of winning a nuclear war. Intermediate-range weapons are so dangerous because they lure leaders into thinking a nuclear war can be "won" by preventing a counter-strike.,2019-08-02 23:21:22,Twitter for iPhone,2,4
1/ For decades the US &amp; Russia the world's two largest nuclear powers have relied on the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty to prevent the unthinkable from happening. This treaty was championed by Reagan &amp; ratified 93-5 in the Senate. https://t.co/SGezGiiSCM,2019-08-02 23:21:21,Twitter for iPhone,14,27
NEWS: yesterday members of the @CECCgov @SenRubioPress @RepChrisSmith @SenatorCardin &amp; I joined together to call on @POTUS to support #HongKong’s autonomy and condemn the use of violence against peaceful protestors in #HongKong.

@MikemacMacInnes Don’t take my word for it. These farmers &amp; their families I spoke with have been cultivating the same exact land for generations &amp; generations. They told us that weather patterns &amp; seasons are getting more extreme &amp; unpredictable. This isn’t politics for them it’s just a fact.,2019-08-02 02:19:44,Twitter for iPhone,0,1
Excited to see @Delta’s first plane to Detroit leave #Worcester tomorrow.  @FlyWorcester continues to serve as a catalyst for economic growth here in Worcester &amp; brings millions of dollars worth of new opportunities to businesses &amp; travelers throughout our region. https://t.co/14XIgdkvEX,2019-08-01 23:02:07,Twitter for iPhone,7,25

We have officially reached our final stop. We‘re grabbing a late lunch &amp; talking about what we saw on Farm Tour 2019. Thanks for following along with me! https://t.co/vfE9PFO53K,2019-08-01 20:51:10,Twitter for iPhone,4,39
One way #ClimateChange is impacting Franklin County? Record rainfall that’s made it harder for Adam to do business.  The rain drives out oxygen from the compost and slows down the process of good bacteria breaking things down. https://t.co/0uUtQB1LJN,2019-08-01 20:32:32,Twitter for iPhone,3,17
Owner Adam Martin hosts open houses so people can understand how composting works &amp; why it’s such an integral part of keeping pollutants out of our environment. https://t.co/DImIZE3tPX,2019-08-01 19:18:30,Twitter for iPhone,2,28
Last stop today is Martin’s Farm in Greenfield a local family-owned business in Greenfield which has been producing top quality compost and mulch for thirty years. https://t.co/VvkeMOAZht,2019-08-01 18:25:12,Twitter for iPhone,6,36
Thank you Representative! Proud to have you as a partner on Beacon Hill to push for local farms &amp; local food! https://t.co/V2W0Gc7eGz,2019-08-01 18:20:52,Twitter for iPhone,2,18
And thank you to @WMassNews &amp; @WWLP22News for coming along to learn with us about how #ClimateChange is impacting our communities. https://t.co/PP4DsKhvox,2019-08-01 18:14:37,Twitter for iPhone,2,15
Our state reps &amp; senators are SO important. These are the people who make the biggest impact in our communities and we are very lucky to have an A+ team in Franklin &amp; Hampshire County speaking for us on Beacon Hill.,2019-08-01 18:14:26,Twitter for iPhone,1,9
Thank you State Representative Natalie Blais (@RepBlais) &amp; State Senator Jo Comerford (@Jo_Comerford) for joining the tour today! https://t.co/aRt2jNPCOk,2019-08-01 18:11:43,Twitter for iPhone,1,6
The unpredictable wet weather means it is harder to grow food to feed their animals.  Farm owner Mike Mahar is looking to expand &amp; we had a great discussion about the types of grants that are available to family farms. We need to make these grants more accessible! https://t.co/o48o4oGQo8,2019-08-01 17:32:12,Twitter for iPhone,4,14
Stop 3 today is Poplar Hill a hundred year old farm located in the hills of West Whately MA on 140 acres.   All their animals are born and raised on the farm are free range and are never fed growth hormones. https://t.co/7wNUnbGZK3,2019-08-01 17:11:00,Twitter for iPhone,7,42
Another #ClimateChange affect that’s harming Danya’s crops? Warmer falls and faster freezes mean plants aren’t as ready for the cold and are more likely to die when winter comes. https://t.co/ROW2dZM9z3,2019-08-01 17:04:35,Twitter for iPhone,3,7
Listen to Danya explain how #ClimateChange is bringing invasive species and pests further north as winters get warmer.  This is not some abstract threat. It is happening right now and our farmers are already feeling major impacts that will only get worse if we do not act. https://t.co/JEJ6bQNgTt,2019-08-01 16:40:15,Twitter for iPhone,10,24
Right now we’re catching up with owner Danya Teitelbaum. She &amp; her partner Matt Biskup employ a small team of dedicated farmers committed to growing flavorful &amp; fresh vegetables for their community! https://t.co/GfEQaYaw7K,2019-08-01 16:19:42,Twitter for iPhone,4,17

First stop on Farm Tour Day 2: Phoenix Fruit Farm &amp; Country Store in Belchertown. They do pick-your-own market through a farm stand on Route 181 and sell to local grocery stores. https://t.co/yZVqTIyZJS,2019-08-01 12:11:38,Twitter for iPhone,2,26

Eating local isn’t just good for our health — it’s good for our environment too. When we don’t have to constantly ship food across the country carbon emissions go down and our air stays cleaner! https://t.co/l1qQxDRiDx,2019-07-31 16:15:56,Twitter for iPhone,4,18
Another hardworking farm in central Massachusetts that’s doing a great job of growing healthy local food for their community! https://t.co/af5RnYVqjK,2019-07-31 15:59:18,Twitter for iPhone,2,14
They’ve got rhubarb peppers beans lettuce and lots more here. They even grow red and yellow potatoes which aren’t common here in Massachusetts! https://t.co/vdLLoXWvW8,2019-07-31 15:19:34,Twitter for iPhone,2,24
Stop 3 today is Cournoyer Vegetable Farm in Paxton MA.   Unlike big farms in the Midwest farms in Massachusetts are smaller and more labor-intensive because we can’t use the same huge equipment. One of the many challenges our farmers face. https://t.co/EtV3sRAuZu,2019-07-31 15:13:01,Twitter for iPhone,12,38

This is what hail does to blueberries. If #ClimateChange causes more hail farmers are going to be dealing with this kind of damage more and more often. https://t.co/JgkvOzs2Ky,2019-07-31 12:35:02,Twitter for iPhone,7,24
☔️ Last year the very wet weather New England had kept people away on the weekends &amp; ruined three pumpkin fields.   🌪 This year was the first time they’ve ever had hail from an unusually strong storm that swung down from the north (also strange) and damaged several fields. https://t.co/pIYiypkwgm,2019-07-31 12:21:28,Twitter for iPhone,1,15
They’ve also got a fantastic country store that’s got New England maple syrup fresh coffee cider local jams and jellies and cider donuts! https://t.co/jWOv1tygtw,2019-07-31 12:11:06,Twitter for iPhone,3,17

✅So I'm visiting 9 farms tomorrow to talk about how #ClimateChange is impacting agriculture across #Massachusetts.  I'll use what I learn to keep fighting for a #GreenNewDeal so that future generations of farmers can continue to nourish our country and protect our land.,2019-07-31 01:33:00,Twitter Web App,5,38
⌛️This isn't some far-off threat.   Family farms are already losing money and producing less because of climate change. Yet in the halls of Congress there's not nearly enough people listening to the farmers that are bearing the brunt of this crisis. https://t.co/3AGW1PIu9c,2019-07-31 01:33:00,Twitter Web App,7,27
🌡️Raising temperatures.  🦗Invasive species.  🌪️Drought and unstable weather.   Small family farms in Massachusetts are on the front lines of #ClimateChange. We need policies that help — yet too often the rich and powerful write laws that favor big corporate farms instead.,2019-07-31 01:33:00,Twitter Web App,2,8
🚜TOMORROW: I'm kicking off a two-day district-wide farm tour to hear directly from farmers in central and western Massachusetts.   Here's why. (hint: it's #ClimateChange) https://t.co/SIJSgV04wg,2019-07-31 01:32:59,Twitter Web App,11,44
Think this summer is a scorcher? Get ready for the heat index to literally go off the charts.  Here's the good news: steep rapid carbon emission reductions can stave off the worst impacts. We need a #GreenNewDeal! https://t.co/qGOgYzSbfq,2019-07-30 12:38:00,TweetDeck,22,84
“Shameful to imply that policy disagreements make us unpatriotic?”  Are you kidding me? Don’t you dare lecture us on “unhinged smears” when you stood in silence as Trump accused Democratic Congresswomen of hating America &amp; being pro Al-Qaeda. We see right through your hypocrisy. https://t.co/jsdwe4JWxv,2019-07-30 01:56:03,Twitter for iPhone,323,969
Thank you @RepPressley for speaking out on this. No child in this country should go hungry. In the richest country in the history of the world hunger should be declared illegal!

2/ Taking sides in these wars resulted in countless civilian deaths. When the wars were over we turned our backs on these countries and didn’t help them deal with corruption or impunity or poverty or any of the systemic issues we created.,2019-07-13 23:20:53,Twitter for iPhone,26,90

Then in 2016 Trump terminated the “Family Case Management” program that even @ICEgov admits was 99% effective in having these families appear before a court.

3/ By promoting competition from less expensive generic drugs instead of allowing brand-name companies to delay H.R. 987 will save patients $$$ on prescription drugs. https://t.co/DN8TwXZ3VE,2019-05-17 03:06:30,Twitter for iPhone,6,7
2/ Quick background: prescription drug prices are so high that 29% of Americans didn’t take medication as prescribed last year due to cost. That’s outrageous!

Evil is what happens when people do not stand up to injustice.   Today on Yom HaShoah let us pause to remember the 6 million Jews &amp; others murdered in the Holocaust.

We're a nation of laws. The normalization of this language is not OK. It should be swiftly and unequivocally condemned by @HouseGOP. You took an oath to your country not to this president. https://t.co/FtAqp0SNt2,2019-05-02 18:28:46,Twitter Web Client,40,122
1) The @WhiteHouse &amp; Congress must reject this racist backward-looking idea. 2) Human rights are universal &amp; are not a “western” concept. 3) America supports the people of China and this administration should change course and make the human rights situation in China a priority. https://t.co/dh7ZoPC4iZ,2019-05-01 18:16:35,Twitter for iPhone,12,30
I am renewing my call for Attorney General Barr to resign.  He lied to the American people about collusion.  He lied to the American people about obstruction.

Hi @HouseCommerce 👋🏻  Democrats don’t hide our intentions. We trust the American people to listen to our debates &amp; make up their mind. You might be unfamiliar with hearings because most Republican bills last Congress didn’t get them &amp; were written behind closed doors. https://t.co/10PGJoMRiI,2019-04-30 18:53:52,Twitter for iPhone,10,49
Let’s say it again for everyone in the back:  Whether we have #MedicareForAll or not American families are going to pay $$$$ for healthcare. Is their money going to pay for wealthy CEOs to get another raise — or to ensure everyone gets great universal healthcare coverage? https://t.co/7WTsPawy35,2019-04-30 16:05:20,Twitter for iPhone,37,78
Today we're holding a historic hearing on #MedicareForAll to talk about high-quality universal coverage.  The Republican alternative can be summed up in one word: repeal. No replacement. No nothing. Their entire agenda is basically "take two tax breaks &amp; call me in the morning." https://t.co/lYg2sX8Jzz,2019-04-30 15:25:56,Twitter Web Client,17,46
One way or another Americans are going to spend trillions of dollars on healthcare in the next decade.  Here’s the question: is it going to pay for high-quality universal coverage?  Or is it mostly going to line the pockets of the wealthy &amp; well-connected?  #MedicareForAll https://t.co/wZx7z4rqE2,2019-04-30 15:13:49,Twitter Web Client,104,244
In Washington everyone's favorite topic is national security.  I believe we need to expand our definition of national security to include more than just the number of bombs we have.
