Our democracy is in trouble. Wealthy insiders &amp; powerful special interests are using their access &amp; influence to stack the deck for themselves. This isn’t the system our founders envisioned. And it’s not what the people of Massachusetts' Second District want.,2019-06-24 12:01:25,Twitter for iPhone,1,4

Thanks to the Sterling Democrats for having me at their “Picnic for the Planet” yesterday!  Climate change is a real and urgent threat to our livelihood.

We cannot lose our humanity because of this terrible President. He wants us all to turn on each other – but instead we need to turn to each other – Democrats and Republicans alike – and reject everything he stands for.,2019-06-15 20:30:31,Twitter for iPhone,1,2
Do everything in your power to build the grassroots movement we need to impeach.  But perhaps most important of all – fight back by standing up for what we believe in. When you see or here something that you know is wrong say something.,2019-06-15 20:30:31,Twitter for iPhone,0,3
I know you all are fighting like hell. Don’t give up. We need to organize even harder. Call your friends and family and urge them to get involved – especially if they live in a Republican district. Donate to candidates that are taking on Trump.,2019-06-15 20:30:31,Twitter for iPhone,0,1

I’m ashamed of what he’s doing to our country and I’m ashamed and outraged that my Republican colleagues in Congress are letting him get away with it.,2019-06-15 20:30:29,Twitter for iPhone,0,1
This week Trump admitted he would break the law in 2020 to win. This man has no shame. He has no problem with Russia or China or anyone else subverting our election. That shocks me to my core. The entire Mueller Report is shocking.,2019-06-15 20:30:29,Twitter for iPhone,0,2
I was proud to join the rally today in #Northampton organized by @MoveOn and @FSFP.   Our constitution and the rule of law is being stretched to the breaking point.,2019-06-15 20:30:28,Twitter for iPhone,1,4

As we approach the next election McConnell — along with Donald Trump — will be two major issues where people are going to have to decide whether they want to continue or not.

This may be true in @realDonaldTrump's world of endless lies &amp; distorted facts - where up is down and left is right. But in the real world it's the @GOP's agenda that everyday Americans can't afford.   Exhibit A: https://t.co/TKLOr4lDTm https://t.co/8LTldeEwlZ,2019-06-06 02:43:18,Twitter Web Client,2,8

Major pharmaceutical companies rake in obscene profits pedaling drugs like opioids.  They spend money assuring us that these medications are safe &amp; large checks are written to lobby politicians.
