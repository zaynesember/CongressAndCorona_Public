If approved these changes would prevent many immigrants from getting the public assistance they need – and that’s why I sent a letter to @DHSgov opposing these changes. https://t.co/56Z9PC94qP,2019-02-01 23:13:10,Twitter Web Client,2,11
I had a great discussion with a group of #climatechange activists in our community on Thursday. As chair of the @EnergyCommerce oversight panel shining a light on the #Trump administration's failure to properly tackle climate change is one of my top priorities. https://t.co/6JQAHMKtto,2019-02-01 23:11:04,Twitter Web Client,11,24
Our first oversight hearing on President Trump’s shameful family separation policy will be next Thursday Feb. 7. Despite the public outrage the previous Republican majority did nothing to hold the administration accountable. That ends next week. https://t.co/3ozLU0LeQT,2019-02-01 02:33:31,Twitter for iPhone,24,61
I'm honored to carry on the dedicated work of women leaders who came before me in getting this amendment ratified. We still need the #ERANow.,2019-01-30 23:09:58,Twitter Web Client,3,11
Both offer new opportunities to protect women from unfair and unjust discrimination. Though we've made strides we still need an amendment to enshrine the rights we deserve.,2019-01-30 23:09:58,Twitter Web Client,4,11
That's why I have signed on to two resolutions -- one that would repeal the expired deadline for the original ERA and another that creates a modified version of the ERA that explicitly guarantees equal rights for men and women.,2019-01-30 23:09:58,Twitter Web Client,3,6
The push to ratify the #EqualRightsAmendment (ERA) was a bold effort to expand women's rights across America. But sadly it wasn't ratified in time by enough states to become law of the land. 37 years after it missed the mark its protections are still needed.,2019-01-30 23:09:58,Twitter Web Client,5,18
Great meeting w/ @nfbco members as well as these two amazing students Deyannira Villa Cazares of Denver and Ian Lee of Aurora who are on Capitol Hill today to help increase access to technology for the visually impaired which is a critical goal for so many fellow Coloradans. https://t.co/IUrNRK1UjC,2019-01-30 22:53:11,Twitter Web Client,1,9
I’m proud to stand with @HouseDemocrats today as a sponsor of the #PaycheckFairnessAct to ensure men and women receive equal pay for equal work. Progress in achieving this goal is still too slow and we need to take bold action by passing this bill. https://t.co/k39ubRYADm,2019-01-30 22:20:49,Twitter Web Client,2,14
We just sent letters to drug makers Eli Lilly Novo Nordisk and Sanofi demanding to know why the price of insulin continues to skyrocket. This is a lifesaving drug that millions of Americans rely on – we can’t let its cost put it out of reach.   https://t.co/DUm5MsUgG6 https://t.co/dahEkrcHFp,2019-01-30 18:24:46,Twitter Web Client,30,102
It’s been 10 years since Pres. Obama signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act into law. It was a monumental step towards ensuring equal pay but we still have a lot of work to do. I’m proud to continue to be working to close this unacceptable pay gap once and for all. https://t.co/lB5UxZSfbj,2019-01-29 20:24:40,Twitter Web Client,8,53
#Trump's @EPA is trying to roll back our nation’s air quality standards to help big corporations make more money while putting our health at risk. That’s not right. And that's why I am working with my @EnergyCommerce colleagues to hold them accountable. https://t.co/lFQ0vtUBNl,2019-01-29 15:43:55,Twitter Web Client,8,29
Just sent a letter to the head of @EPA demanding info about the Trump administration’s plan to roll back air-quality standards. We’re not going to sit back and let this administration put Americans’ health at risk just so companies can make more money. https://t.co/3XBRk5hFiY,2019-01-29 01:23:12,Twitter for iPhone,20,78
New @USCBO report shows the #shutdown caused $3 billion in permanent damage to our economy. But no number can quantify the suffering it caused to so many hardworking families. For the sake of our country and economy we must never allow another crisis like this to happen again. https://t.co/FXrdj47RNU,2019-01-28 19:28:23,Twitter Web Client,4,24
The effects of this awful #shutdown will be felt long after our government is reopened especially for federal employees and contractors living paycheck to paycheck. Financial institutions need to show patience and we must work to ensure they all receive the pay they’re due.,2019-01-26 19:15:15,Twitter for iPhone,11,52
Check out my latest e-newsletter recapping some of this week’s important developments including the agreement just reached to reopen the federal government. https://t.co/hHKkDsgl8B,2019-01-25 23:48:19,Twitter Web Client,4,9
This government shutdown should never have happened. We need to work quickly to get the government reopened and ensure every federal worker is paid the money they are due. Then we need to work to make sure another crisis like this never happens again. https://t.co/otoUFZuL43,2019-01-25 21:35:44,Twitter Web Client,6,20
Excited to announce that in addition to serving on @EnergyCommerce this Congress I'll also serve on the House Natural Resources Committee. This gives us a great opportunity to keep working to protect CO’s environment &amp; public lands for future generations. https://t.co/D64uMas7CK https://t.co/vg5XOC8w5Y,2019-01-24 21:40:02,Twitter Web Client,8,29
Americans are hurting Mr. President. Enough is enough. We need to end the shutdown now. Then work with Congress to find real solutions to enhance our border security. Coloradans and all Americans deserve leadership - not a tantrum.,2019-01-23 21:12:23,Twitter Web Client,8,31
I support enhancing our border security but we need to have a real conversation about it instead of this “my way or the highway” approach President Trump is stuck on.,2019-01-23 21:12:22,Twitter Web Client,8,34
The House has voted multiple times to reopen the government but President #Trump and Senate Republicans refuse to end this shutdown. They are holding our government and economy hostage for a ridiculous wall. The American people deserve better. We need to end the #shutdown now.,2019-01-23 21:12:22,Twitter Web Client,18,72
This is a devastating blow in the fight for #equality. I've been working to oppose this unjust policy from the beginning and despite this setback we won't quit now. This is about legitimizing #trans Americans' inherent value -- in our military and our society at large. https://t.co/iJgulKBRr7,2019-01-22 21:44:22,Twitter Web Client,10,45
As we recall both events this week we're reminded that for every victory affirming and protecting our #reprorights there is an effort to suppress them. With so much at stake we can't let up the fight to defend women's health and I'll lead the way. @ProChoiceCaucus #Roe46 https://t.co/f2wNtEaePl,2019-01-22 19:41:19,Twitter Web Client,5,30
Today is the 46th anniversary of the #RoevWade decision establishing American women's constitutional right to choose. But tomorrow also marks two year's since President Trump reinstated the anti-choice Global Gag Rule threatening that right for women around the world.,2019-01-22 19:41:18,Twitter Web Client,19,49
It was a joy to once again participate in Denver’s annual #Marade where we came together to honor Dr. King’s enduring legacy. His spirit is alive and well in our community and we must continue working to fully realize his ideals across America and around the world. #MLKDay https://t.co/i4qCb5exiR,2019-01-21 21:45:10,Twitter for iPhone,7,31
Happy #MLKDay! As we honor this civil rights icon let's also recommit ourselves to serving our community and advancing the fight for equality. We're not there yet but we can get closer if we remain united by Dr. King’s timeless ideals. https://t.co/nD1gX4qIQ2,2019-01-21 14:05:04,Twitter for iPhone,1,24
