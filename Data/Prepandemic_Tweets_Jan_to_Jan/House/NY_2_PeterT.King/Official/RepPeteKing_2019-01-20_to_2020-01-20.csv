Now that all the publicity from the 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund news conference is behind us the hard work of lining up votes begins. And we will get it done. Too many brave people like NYPD Bomb Squad Det. Lou Alvarez have suffered for us not to fully fund the VCF. https://t.co/NQbdUaXtd1,2019-02-27 17:27:47,Twitter for iPhone,10,37

Congrats to Chicago PD exposing @JussieSmollett racist homophobe hate crime hoax. Sad that media &amp; Dem Presidential candidates were so quick to believe Smollett b4 they had facts &amp; despite holes in story.

Clear lesson from @Amazon disaster: Time for New York Gov’t leaders to speak out and make it clear that radical progressives will not control decisions affecting future of NY. Real leaders don’t surrender to fear or intimidation or stay quiet when strong voices are needed.,2019-02-15 19:13:29,Twitter for iPhone,30,130
Voted to fully fund govt &amp; avoid another disastrous shutdown. Hope @POTUS Trump realizes he can’t take advice from Freedom Caucus. They led him into shutdown w no chance of winning like Charge of Light Brigade. &amp; last night they abandoned him to vote w anti-Trump progressive left,2019-02-15 12:07:20,Twitter for iPhone,6,63
This is one time I agree with @NYCMayor de Blasio and @NYGovCuomo. Loss of @Amazon is terrible for New York. All because progressives put sanctimony and ideological purity before workers and taxpayers. Sad day for New York.,2019-02-14 18:09:07,Twitter for iPhone,130,543
Absolutely disgraceful that @Amazon is driven from New York by left wing progressive politicians. Terrible loss of jobs for New York workers and New York economy.,2019-02-14 17:13:49,Twitter for iPhone,134,565

Border deal is far from perfect. But is a step in the right direction. Reality is we have divided government. Time to realize you never get all you want when government is divided. Another shutdown would be bad for the country and a gift to Democrats. Let’s get back to real work.,2019-02-12 17:45:18,Twitter for iPhone,7,48

Good news that the federal government will reopen. Shouldn’t have happened in the first place. Now time for Democrats to fund border wall and Republicans to move on DACA and TPS. Both sides should ignore fringes - Progressives on the left and Freedom Caucus on the right.,2019-01-25 20:51:18,Twitter for iPhone,24,114
