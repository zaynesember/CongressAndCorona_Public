Now that the #TrumpShutdown is ending I'm laser focused on making sure tax refunds still come out on time despite the Admin furloughing tens of thousands of IRS employees for a month. We can't let the shutdown cost working families their livelihood. https://t.co/dYvmNnzBCc,2019-01-26 20:40:04,Hootsuite Inc.,9,15
