Ummm . . . No. It’s entirely because of #1 tax cuts. The 2001 Bush tax cuts + 2003 Bush tax cuts + 2017 GOP Tax Cuts = 100% of our budget deficit. https://t.co/GkgcC617JN,2019-10-26 00:43:45,Twitter for iPhone,16,60

@brianros1 Fair point Brian. But think of all the things you would have gotten in 2009-10 without a filibuster.

Weak answer from @SenGillibrand. The way the filibuster has been abused in the last 15 years by the GOP is completely at odds with Senate and American history. It used to be rarely invoked.
