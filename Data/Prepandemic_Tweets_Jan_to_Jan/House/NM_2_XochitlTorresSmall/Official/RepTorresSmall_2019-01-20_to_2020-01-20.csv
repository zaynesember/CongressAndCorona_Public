It is time we get in front of this. It is time for this issue to receive adequate attention from the Pentagon. It is time DoD stops trying to limit liability and steps up to aid those who supported them.,2019-07-10 21:04:34,Twitter Web App,12,46
That is why we want to explicitly give DoD the authority to provide uncontaminated water or water treatment when a military installation is found responsible for PFOS or PFOA contamination in agricultural products destined for human consumption.,2019-07-10 21:04:34,Twitter Web App,8,42
Yet the DoD has repeatedly failed to address this problem and provide relief when water for agricultural use needs to be replaced.,2019-07-10 21:04:34,Twitter Web App,6,22
Not only is this a case of precious wasted resources but shows that PFAS contamination affects local business’ livelihood as well.,2019-07-10 21:04:33,Twitter Web App,4,25
For example Highland Dairy Farm in New Mexico was forced to close its doors after 25 years due to a PFAS contamination from nearby Cannon Air Force Base.,2019-07-10 21:04:33,Twitter Web App,6,29
Let's not forget that crops and herds are taking in the same contaminated water in some cases destroying the livelihoods of farmers and sending contaminated products into grocery stores across the country.,2019-07-10 21:04:33,Twitter Web App,6,27
They've been found in groundwater supplies near Cannon &amp; Holloman AFB endangering NM ag. It's time we get in front of this and provide our farmers across the country clean water.,2019-07-10 21:04:33,Twitter Web App,7,30
FACT: PFAS contaminants have been linked to diseases like cancer and developmental issues in kids &amp; are the main component of firefighting foams on military installations,2019-07-10 21:04:32,Twitter Web App,11,27
The President has issued a veto threat of the #NDAA and claimed that it's because it would allow DoD to replace water used by our farmers if it's found to be contaminated w/ PFAS   Let me set the record straight.,2019-07-10 21:04:32,Twitter Web App,42,74

#Route66 has a special place in my district. It inspired countless TV shows movies and songs and continues to attract visitors today bringing important tourism to our smaller rural communities. Proud to support H.R. 66! 🚗 https://t.co/5C8kWxm0LE,2019-02-07 15:42:43,TweetDeck,10,70

That’s why I joined 160 of my colleagues to send a letter to @DepSecDef Shanahan asking him to allow transgender troops to continue to openly serve and will fight the implementation of this discriminatory policy as a member of @HASCDemocrats #ProtectTransTroops https://t.co/oe4JleBhr1,2019-02-04 22:40:45,Twitter Web Client,7,57
There are nearly 147000 transgender service members that stood up and took an oath to protect our freedom and ideals. In return we should be providing our gratitude not stigmatization. https://t.co/uoqiP3KIsU,2019-02-04 22:40:45,Twitter Web Client,12,62
As the only Member of the @HomelandDems that represents a district on the southern border I’m proud to be named Chair of the OMA Subcommittee. Looking forward to finding real solutions to strengthen our border security.  https://t.co/v7VMQW6lHO,2019-02-01 20:22:28,Twitter Web Client,49,217
Do you agree it’s time to end shutdowns forever? The SEAS Act will put an end to future shutdowns and protect hardworking Americans. #NoMoreShutdowns #SEASact Read more here: https://t.co/qxytbgcymc,2019-01-31 22:16:51,Twitter Web Client,30,124

I believe in investing in smart proven border security measures like the ones I had the opportunity to talk with Border Patrol Agents &amp; Customs Officers on the ground about this weekend. Things like better radar more manpower at our ports and medical &amp; personnel training https://t.co/YMzDvCOBVu,2019-01-28 16:53:54,Twitter for iPhone,67,216
Stopped in Socorro on my way home this weekend. It was great to see so many come out to discuss the community’s challenges and opportunities. I look forward to spending more time there soon! https://t.co/3G6FgzykqB,2019-01-27 23:11:42,Twitter for iPhone,9,75
Thank you to all those who participated in the food drive for federal employees in Sunland Park yesterday. It is so inspiring to see a community rally around its neighbors. https://t.co/ek4TNYSs6J,2019-01-27 16:55:08,Twitter for iPhone,12,91
The most critical time for wildfire prevention work is right now. The Forest Service &amp; BIA Wildland Fire Management teams have to wait b/c of the #governmentshutdown. If we don't work together now NM will feel the effects of this long after it ends  https://t.co/Fq9lkk4YYV,2019-01-25 16:00:00,TweetDeck,5,27
Thanks to all who joined me last weekend in Deming! Challenges facing rural communities need to be a priority for both parties in this Congress.  Looking forward to another few days at home this weekend  https://t.co/93eXH10fED,2019-01-25 13:30:00,TweetDeck,8,56
Only a #bipartisan effort will end the #governmentshutdown.   Yesterday I along with other colleagues called on the leadership of both parties to come together end the shutdown and commit to finding long term solutions to the real challenges we face on the border.,2019-01-24 16:00:31,TweetDeck,22,82
Needless to say I was extremely disappointed by SCOTUS’ decision allowing the transgender ban to go into effect. As a member of the House Armed Services I look forward to fighting this policy in committee.  https://t.co/4xRzVQcocT,2019-01-24 00:46:33,TweetDeck,8,55
Our women and men in uniform put their lives on the line to defend our country and its freedoms. Anyone qualified able and willing to make the ultimate sacrifice for our country should be allowed to serve free from discrimination.,2019-01-24 00:45:46,TweetDeck,15,102
This week 2 forest fires broke out in Lincoln County.  Members of the BIA's​ Wildland Fire Management team responded.  Because of the #governmentshutdown these responders who are battling dangerous conditions aren't being paid. They deserve better!  https://t.co/qwkR8IyTvu,2019-01-23 21:21:55,TweetDeck,22,66
On my way back to DC and I’m reminded of the TSA agent I met on my way home last weekend. He stopped to tell me that he was raising his grandson and not receiving a paycheck was putting a squeeze on their household. Our federal employees deserve better! #ShutdownStories,2019-01-22 14:26:54,Twitter for iPhone,55,241

Celebrating #MLKDay and honoring Dr. King’s life and legacy with the @NAACP Doña Ana Chapter this morning.

In the mean time I’ve spoken with employees at our federal prisons border patrol agents and customs officers air traffic controllers and TSA agents. They're working hard even though the government is failing them. It's time we do our job.,2019-01-20 16:02:20,Twitter for iPhone,4,37
This proposal does not "solve" the crisis at the border.  We also need to discuss manpower and infrastructure at our ports permanent status for DREAMers  expanded work visas and a safer more orderly process for people presenting at our border,2019-01-20 16:01:57,Twitter for iPhone,9,48
I am glad to see the President identify issues he is willing to discuss but the temporary provisions he outlined don’t solve our long-term problems and broken border policy.,2019-01-20 16:00:57,Twitter for iPhone,3,15
New Mexicans are sick of politicians squabbling over speeches and flights.  We need everyone at the table to get our government back on track,2019-01-20 16:00:27,Twitter for iPhone,14,88
