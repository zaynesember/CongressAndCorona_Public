Had a great time visiting with the people of Socorro today! As I ramp up for November it's wonderful to see so many friends ready to hit the ground running. #nm02 #nmpol https://t.co/G5x0IwPKOD,2020-01-19 00:16:47,TweetDeck,8,39
On Sunday I was proud to endorse @benraylujan to be New Mexico's next Senator. He is a tireless advocate for his district who fights for New Mexican values. I know he will bring the same type of leadership next year to the Senate #nmpol https://t.co/ykzjdKbx4I,2020-01-14 22:52:47,TweetDeck,14,41

Let’s be real here — the most common use of the word “complexion” refers to skin color. Our words have consequences and the only reasonable response is to apologize. Dog whistles have no place in New Mexican politics. https://t.co/0tKhYXZerr,2019-12-21 00:30:53,Twitter for iPhone,54,203
