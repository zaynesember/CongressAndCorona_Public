As "Captain" for Erie County residents can be confident that @markpoloncarz is best equipped to win challenging faceoffs on behalf of this community.

No matter how much time I spend in DC I'm always honored and humbled by the love and support I receive from grassroots Team Higgins supporters here in Buffalo &amp; WNY. Thank you to everyone who came out in such massive numbers to support us last week. https://t.co/TmSc6lDRiv,2019-08-26 12:35:08,Twitter for iPhone,4,16
A new location but things are very much the same: the annual Team Higgins family picnic is still the best party of the summer. Thank you to Rick Smith and our friends at Duende for giving us a very special night in Silo City. https://t.co/lbfoJu3JDC,2019-08-26 12:32:56,Twitter for iPhone,1,5
Today the Trump administration will argue in court that the entire #ACA including pre-existing conditions protections should be struck down. The GOP hasn't stopped trying to strip these crucial protections from millions of Americans and still have no plan to #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/eRgWR21ETd,2019-07-09 14:47:06,Twitter for iPhone,8,7
