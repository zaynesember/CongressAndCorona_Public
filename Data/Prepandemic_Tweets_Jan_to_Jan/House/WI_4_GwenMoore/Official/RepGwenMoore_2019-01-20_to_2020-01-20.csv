A8: My bill that provides doula/midwife training and education for low-income women expands economic &amp; educational opportunity while tackling the maternal/infant health crisis. #MaternalJustice,2019-08-27 01:18:02,Twitter Web App,3,10
A8: Diversifying who enters these professions is a promising start toward more competent care for mothers of color. #MaternalJustice https://t.co/lOQLMEQ9wz,2019-08-27 01:18:01,Twitter Web App,5,7
A7: We can make the MOST impact by allowing those mothers to have access to these critical services. #MaternalJustice,2019-08-27 00:58:58,Twitter Web App,5,6
A7: We have a shamefully high infant and maternal mortality rate with low-income and Black women experiencing the worst birth outcomes. Every year 4 million women give birth and more than half of them are on Medicaid.  #MaternalJustice https://t.co/dnJoYe6taZ,2019-08-27 00:58:57,Twitter Web App,5,7
@MomsRising A6.2: In Milwaukee 100 new low-income mothers will receive doulas which will expand maternal care to an underserved community. Expanding this care is critical given that in WI black mothers are 3-5x more likely to die giving birth than white mothers. #MaternalJustice,2019-08-27 00:51:32,Twitter Web App,1,5
A6.1: I'm proud to say that Governor Evers has proposed a “Healthy Women Healthy Babies” initiative that expands Medicaid coverage for post-partum mothers to include doula services. It will tackle Wisconsin’s high racial disparities in birth outcomes. #MaternalJustice https://t.co/0QNY6IhSpx,2019-08-27 00:47:05,Twitter Web App,9,43
A5: Mothers of color continue to experience lower quality care because of these engrained biases. Implicit bias training not only ensures more culturally competent care but helps tackle maternal health disparities head on. #MaternalJustice https://t.co/osHzEhL9AQ,2019-08-27 00:42:14,Twitter Web App,4,3
A4.1: It guarantees that the doula and midwife understand a mother’s social and cultural values &amp; uses this information to provide specialized care. #MaternalJustice,2019-08-27 00:30:06,Twitter Web App,1,2
A4.1: Culturally competent care is crucial for mothers of color because the quality of care is contingent on understanding the unique challenges that these mothers face. #MaternalJustice https://t.co/sYDqSsObEu,2019-08-27 00:30:06,Twitter Web App,2,4
A3: Many Black women voice their concerns about their symptoms only to be dismissed or ignored in the doctor’s office. A doula/midwife can provide support that helps put mothers at ease through the birth experience. #MaternalJustice https://t.co/zdyHlCKV1I,2019-08-27 00:21:08,Twitter Web App,4,4
A2: This can help fill the gaps in care by providing holistic support that is often missing in a medical setting. #MaternalJustice,2019-08-27 00:16:15,Twitter Web App,5,8
A2: I think that many mothers of color want a natural safe pregnancy and see midwifery and doula care as a viable option. Many Black women bear scars of trauma from the healthcare system and want to empower themselves and other mothers. #MaternalJustice https://t.co/6PSwVNrDu8,2019-08-27 00:16:14,Twitter Web App,10,11
A1: I introduced a bill to ensure that low-income women (who qualify for TANF) can receive training and education to become a doula or midwife. This will help usher in more doulas/midwives from diverse backgrounds. #MaternalJustice,2019-08-27 00:12:44,Twitter Web App,5,15
A1: Educational disparities stemming from limited access along with low pay from low reimbursement rates have kept women of color out of these careers. #MaternalJustice https://t.co/juqxoO8T70,2019-08-27 00:12:43,Twitter Web App,6,9

Like I've said before the House passed gun safety legislation. The Senate's failure to act only leave Americans more vulnerable to #gunviolence.  Americans deserve to feel safe.

I was named a 2018 Retiree Hero by the Alliance for Retired Americans. I will keep fighting to protect pension benefits and lowering the cost of prescription drugs to guarantee a good quality of life for American retirees. https://t.co/dEFOpWojZ4,2019-08-21 21:18:37,Twitter for iPhone,4,20
Trump's nervous because his economic policies are failing.  While Trump started a #tradewar and gave tax cuts to the rich @HouseDemocrats passed bills to raise the minimum wage save retirees' pensions and lower the cost of prescription drugs to put more $$ in Americans pockets. https://t.co/bhXdwIbr4N,2019-08-21 20:24:18,Twitter Web App,3,6
Trump has more loyalty to the gun manufacturing lobby than the schoolchildren back to school shoppers festival and club goers worshippers and other innocent Americans who lost their lives to gun violence. https://t.co/6ojmve56Kx,2019-08-21 18:34:14,Twitter Web App,7,17
The #FloresSettlement ensures humane treatment of children held in govt custody.

90% of the American people agree that it’s time for the Senate to pass the bipartisan #HR8 and expand background checks. We asked @SenateMajLdr McConnell to hold a vote to end gun violence and he hasn’t even responded. #DoSomething https://t.co/F3BzApW7Hx,2019-08-20 19:13:36,Twitter Web App,3,22

Trump's "gag rule" has left Planned Parenthood no other option - forcing their withdrawal from #TitleX.

Trump and his administration treat immigrants like a burden to our country. Trump should know that American history proves him wrong. Immigrants make our country stronger.

.@GOP has voted 70 times to defund our healthcare system. They care more about the cost of the ACA than the value of human life.  I announced my remission today bc I know the value of life &amp; I know preserving the health of the American public is a price worth paying. @nowthisnews https://t.co/YNoYv6stfg,2019-01-29 21:32:19,Twitter Media Studio,453,1156

Life-threatening illness doesn't discriminate. We aren't immune to it nor are our loved ones. &amp; yet for nearly a decade @GOP has attacked the ACA weakening its protections &amp; threatening coverage for millions.  That ends now.

.@GOP is always talking about the costs of the ACA: the cost of protecting pre-existing conditions the cost of essential health benefits the cost of the individual mandate.  But what about the value of life? The lives of your kids? Your parents?  That's the core of this debate. https://t.co/FOozuMwGfW,2019-01-29 16:53:27,Twitter Web Client,24,65
.@HouseGOP have taken a machete to the ACA &amp; with it protections for Americans against insurance companies with one mission: profit.  That ends now. Democrats are back at the helm &amp; we're determined to ensure all Americans have access to quality affordable coverage. https://t.co/zc3iprn4BE,2019-01-29 00:12:58,Twitter Web Client,12,44
Wisconsinites did not cause the #TrumpShutdown so they should not pay the price. Cutting working American's pay because Trump is having a temper tantrum is unacceptable.  Wisconsinites need their money back. https://t.co/qmNOe9NyAZ,2019-01-28 22:44:20,Twitter Web Client,14,42

For 35 days 800000 of our nation’s federal workers &amp; their families suffered as many were forced to live in their cars ration medicine &amp; struggle to put food on the table.

It's no surprise to me that out of touch billionaires like Wilbur Ross can't even comprehend that 78% of American workers depend on their next paycheck to put food on the table for their families.

#RoevWade is a promise of freedom &amp; agency.
