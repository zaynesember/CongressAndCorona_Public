In Washington we have been fighting to protect people with pre-existing conditions. Thank you @rattijulia for introducing legislation at the state level. #NVLeg,2019-03-20 00:36:40,Twitter for iPhone,3,11
Protecting our land water and wildlife is not only important for future generations but also provides a significant boost to our state’s economy. In fact outdoor recreation generates more than $12.6 billion in economic activity in Nevada. #NVLeg,2019-03-20 00:34:01,Twitter for iPhone,1,11
It’s embarrassing that our President is unwilling to say that climate change is real climate change is man-made and climate change is happening right now. #NVLeg,2019-03-20 00:31:38,Twitter for iPhone,2,7
Let me be perfectly clear: We will not stand idly by as the Trump Administration treats Nevada as the dumping ground for the nation’s nuclear waste. We do not produce nuclear waste and we should not be forced to store it. #NVLeg,2019-03-20 00:29:12,Twitter for iPhone,4,15
We each have an obligation to make it clear that our state values all our guests and all our residents. We should be putting out a welcome mat not building a wall. #NVLeg,2019-03-20 00:28:17,Twitter for iPhone,1,7
The federal government will conduct the census in 2020. Ensuring that every Nevadan is counted must be a priority for all of us. #NVLeg,2019-03-20 00:23:29,Twitter for iPhone,1,4
I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: You can’t trust the DOE when it comes to nuclear issues. #NVLeg,2019-03-20 00:20:00,Twitter for iPhone,4,6

It's absurd that it took this long for the House to hold hearings on gun violence prevention. We should start with legislation to expand background checks and ban bump stocks. Let's get to work. https://t.co/Be9RtqliJ7,2019-01-31 20:12:51,Twitter Web Client,10,29

Whether we realize it or not we're all impacted by the curtailing of food inspections and the inability of FBI agents to follow leads that would take criminals off our streets during this shutdown.
