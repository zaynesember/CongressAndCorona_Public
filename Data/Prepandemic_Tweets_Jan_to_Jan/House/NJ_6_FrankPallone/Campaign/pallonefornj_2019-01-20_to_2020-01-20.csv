The stakes couldn't be higher. The GOP is itching to do everything they can to take health insurance away from millions of people. We can only stop it if Democrats win everywhere. https://t.co/oPX3pl62iJ,2019-08-08 20:48:40,Twitter for iPhone,0,0

Only thing less surprising than Trump's xenophobic language is that he doesn't even know what he's talking about@ least he's consistent!

Frank and House Democrats have been working tirelessly to help the American people. But what is McConnell doing? Turning the Senate into a graveyard and calling himself "The Grim Reaper."

Looks like Trump is doubling down on lies and fear in his 2020 campaign.
