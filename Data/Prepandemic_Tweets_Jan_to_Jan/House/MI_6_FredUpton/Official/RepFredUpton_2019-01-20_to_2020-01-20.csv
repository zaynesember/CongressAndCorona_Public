Agriculture has been particularly hurt with this trade war. That's why so many in the #MI06 ag community are saying “Okay let’s get this thing over with. Let's move forward.” https://t.co/AYWcj6Uzk9,2019-05-14 22:39:23,Twitter Media Studio,11,14
It’s a trade war – tit for tat with China. It’s hundreds of billions of dollars of new tariffs – taxes as some will say – and it’s the consumer that pays. We’re all going to be hurt from it the longer that it lasts. #MI06 https://t.co/CN3BkcntdG,2019-05-14 20:37:05,Twitter Media Studio,6,20

Tariffs are coming at a pretty high price. They’re putting SW MI jobs at risk. They’re hurting our manufacturers &amp; farmers. At some point we need certainty in the process and for these temporary tariffs we hope they will be just that - temporary. https://t.co/RFJyH7SAA0 #MI06,2019-05-14 16:20:01,TweetDeck,7,17
If we want to keep manufacturing jobs here at home we need to put an end to the tariffs. I’m going to continue fighting for southwest Michigan workers jobs and job creators.

But the Constitution is clear that spending originates in the Congress. That’s why I voted to override the President’s veto.

Every minute of every day these officers put their lives on the line. When you see a law enforcement official be sure to thank them for their service.

You can expect a strong bipartisan Michigan-led effort to once again protect every penny of the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative - and we will prevail.

One of my big objections to #HR1 is the taxpayer finance campaign element of the bill. We are going to have more money in politics and we are not going to have the transparency that I think all of us want.  That's why today I voted NO. https://t.co/DjAMycil2K,2019-03-08 19:19:28,Twitter Media Studio,3,11

#HR1 is not bipartisan. And one of our big objections is the taxpayer finance campaign element of the bill.   Under HR 1 we would have more money in politics and we are not going to have the transparency that all of us want. https://t.co/nryZxP4Glt,2019-03-06 22:34:42,Twitter Media Studio,3,5

John Dingell was more than just the Dean of the House.
