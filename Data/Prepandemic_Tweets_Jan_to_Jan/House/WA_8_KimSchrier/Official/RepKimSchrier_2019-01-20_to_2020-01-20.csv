The average age of a child involved in an accidental shooting is 3. And  over 17000 children and teens are injured or killed by gun violence every year. We must do better. #enoughisenough #EndGunViolence,2019-02-06 18:26:58,Twitter Web Client,88,208

Background checks are a big part of gun safety. But guns must be stored safely so they don’t end up in the hands of children or those who would do themselves or others harm. https://t.co/9wabinvXaN,2019-02-05 14:23:37,Twitter Web Client,8,31
Due to inclement weather my office in Issaquah will be closed today. Stay safe and warm out there!,2019-02-04 14:29:28,Twitter Web Client,0,20
Yet another attempt to restrict women's access to healthcare. Rather than creating medically unwarranted barriers to abortion care how about focusing on real threats to women like maternal mortality? Make no mistake delayed abortion only increases risk to women. Enough! https://t.co/wXhNbqEK55,2019-02-01 16:49:07,Twitter Web Client,16,49

Now let’s work together on sensible evidence-based border security measures that will keep government open and prevent something like this from happening again. The American people should never be held hostage as a negotiating technique.,2019-01-25 21:24:02,Twitter Web Client,13,48
While I am happy that the shutdown will soon be over it has been an incredibly frustrating month for hundreds of thousands of people who had to needlessly suffer. Let’s be clear: this is not a way to govern.,2019-01-25 21:24:01,Twitter Web Client,12,69

Today I read #ShutdownStories from my constituents on the floor. What the President offered on Saturday is no compromise. It's lip service. People are hurting. We need to reopen the government now. https://t.co/2JaGt78nss,2019-01-23 16:48:32,Twitter Web Client,15,38
We're 1 month into the #shutdown. 800000 employees will not receive a 2nd paycheck this week with many families finding it increasingly hard to put food on the table. We must #EndTheShutdown and get the gov't working #ForThePeople,2019-01-22 18:37:28,Twitter Web Client,9,28
46 years after #RoevWade and we still cannot count on abortion remaining safe and legal. I stand strong against all efforts to curb women's access to reproductive healthcare. Stand with me. #Roe46,2019-01-22 17:17:25,Twitter Web Client,24,89
