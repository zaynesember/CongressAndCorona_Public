American women were not given the right to vote. Women of all races fought and won tough battles to secure the suffrage.

House Democrats listened to voices across America to determine key priorities to do the most good #ForThePeople; they are now buried in Mitch McConnell’s proverbial graveyard.

House Democrats also locked arms with workers in the #FightFor15 by acting to raise the minimum wage.

House Democrats were sent to Washington to make progress #ForThePeople. When the vast majority of Americans want Congress to #ProtectOurCare and to lower health care costs Republicans in the Senate can help to deliver on that or plan for retirement.  https://t.co/1hLfvqfDio,2019-05-15 14:54:18,Twitter Web Client,1757,3521
Women’s rights are under attack. This relentless and cruel Republican assault on women’s health is designed to force a court battle to destroy Roe v. Wade. Democrats will be ready to defend health care and women’s reproductive freedom.,2019-05-15 02:35:56,Twitter for iPhone,10118,37402

House Democrats and Nancy are fighting to provide accountability and working on solutions to address the kitchen table concerns of families across the country — delivering on their promised agenda #ForThePeople to empower families and increase equality and opportunity for all.,2019-05-13 20:11:45,Twitter for iPhone,1365,4216

🎴 Republicans in Washington are making it clear: they *do not* believe people with pre-existing conditions should be protected. This is ridiculous. 🎴 https://t.co/V1E06kWlDs,2019-05-08 15:33:05,Twitter Web Client,5295,10479

For the past five years @latinovictoryus has recruited and supported Latino candidates. Their work was critical to electing the most diverse freshmen class in history — including the first two Latinas from Texas. Happy anniversary!,2019-05-07 22:09:15,Twitter for iPhone,152,560
The House has taken action to protect women from domestic violence defend our health care from Trump’s attacks guarantee equal pay for equal work and much more.

As Republicans were wasting millions of dollars on more than 130000 ads across the country with ugly caricatures of Nancy she and other Democratic candidates were busy investing in American families with an agenda #ForThePeople.

Nothing is more wholesome than the increased participation of women in our politics. That is today’s message.

After promising to #ProtectOurCare Justice Dept confirmed in court that the Trump Administration wants to wipe the Affordable Care Act off the books along with the health care of millions of American families.  McConnell and McCarthy meanwhile want to destroy it in Congress. https://t.co/mYQgwJxQYO,2019-05-04 17:04:36,Twitter for iPhone,2526,3328
But no matter how many times it takes we will knock back any and all attempts at stripping away health care of millions of Americans.   #ProtectOurCare,2019-05-04 14:11:50,Twitter for iPhone,1155,4117
One thing is clear: Trump and Republicans think people don’t deserve access to quality health care. They think insurance companies should be able to discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions.  Quite simply this is deadly.,2019-05-04 14:11:50,Twitter for iPhone,1293,3788
Today instead of joining Democrats to lower the cost of prescription drugs and increase health coverage Republicans are playing a deadly game with the lives of the American people by targeting the Affordable Care Act in court.,2019-05-04 14:11:49,Twitter for iPhone,689,1276
Exactly two years ago Trump and House Republicans celebrated the passage of Trumpcare that guts protections for those with pre-existing conditions and rips health coverage from over 20 million Americans.   📽 from @ProtectOurCare https://t.co/QZbF7TEESw,2019-05-04 14:11:49,Twitter for iPhone,3782,6560

If Trump and Washington Republicans get their way "more than 20 million Americans" will *lose* their health insurance.   https://t.co/FmJYmU75sM,2019-05-02 12:49:45,Twitter Web Client,5336,7054
It’s only becoming more and more obvious that Attorney General Barr has been acting alternately as Trump’s criminal defense lawyer and publicist – spinning #MuellerReport details to his *client’s* best advantage. Now we know Mueller has a problem with that! https://t.co/5rA1xDWWBe,2019-05-01 14:41:45,Twitter for iPhone,9284,25172
