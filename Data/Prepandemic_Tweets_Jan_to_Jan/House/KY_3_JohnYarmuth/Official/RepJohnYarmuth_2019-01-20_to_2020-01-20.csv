Among the projects on President Trump’s chopping block: $62M in funding that was headed to Fort Campbell for a new middle school to help with overcrowded classrooms. The president’s obsession with his dumb wall is hurting Kentucky military families. https://t.co/HLjBsdFwTV,2019-09-05 15:10:20,Twitter for iPhone,20,33
This reckless action not only steals funding from our military to build an ineffective wall (that the President promised Mexico would pay for) it also violates the separation of powers and Congress’s Constitutional power of the purse.
