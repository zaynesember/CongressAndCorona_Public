In just 4 years the cost of insulin has DOUBLED. These skyrocketing costs have forced 1-in-4 diabetes patients to ration their insulin. This is unconscionable.

@SeemaCMS I am very concerned about hospitals closing in my district &amp; other low-income communities across the country. That's why I asked Administrator @SeemaCMS to provide my office with data on hospital closures to better understand this issue &amp; what can be done to prevent it. https://t.co/joRYgJhGnF,2019-10-24 19:22:26,Twitter Web App,8,16

Yesterday I asked the head of CMS a very simple question: Why are there so many #dialysis centers in black neighborhoods. She was unable to give me a straight answer.   I will continue to push this admin to make sure that my constituents are not subject to predatory practices. https://t.co/MFJMIZEL22,2019-10-24 17:24:06,Twitter Web App,11,41
It's always good to see my dear friend and colleague @repjohnlewis — even during these difficult times.

The Conservative Circus &amp; their ring leader @RepMattGaetz are so desperate to appease the Criminal-in-Chief that they are willing to lie to the American people.

I might not be alive today if I did not have access to affordable lifesaving drugs during my fight with #cancer. Today @EnergyCommerce is taking action to make sure ALL Americans have that same access.   We MUST #LowerDrugCostsNow! https://t.co/8By1784sYl,2019-10-17 20:30:17,Twitter Web App,2,14
With that said it is critical that we find a way to lower the cap on out-of-pocket costs w/out increasing premiums and as it stands #HR3 does this while taking the strongest stance to help #LowerDrugCosts.   More info on H.R.3 and today's markup here: https://t.co/xOSAgoVYOD,2019-10-17 17:30:38,Twitter Web App,1,5
In last month’s Health subcommittee hearing on #HR3 we heard from Dr. Gerard Anderson that a $2000 cap would be beneficial to only 4% of #Medicare beneficiaries. To address this I believe we should lower the cap on out-of-pocket costs to $1500 annually. https://t.co/jyaMPQ9Fz7,2019-10-17 17:07:08,Twitter Web App,3,8
I am especially pleased that #HR3 includes a $2000 annual cap on out-of-pocket costs for #prescription drugs in #Medicare Part-D because currently there is no such cap.   However I remain concerned that the $2000 cap will still be excessive for too many of my constituents. https://t.co/hKAWLXrY0p,2019-10-17 16:56:05,Twitter Web App,4,6
I am excited not only about #HR3 — which will #LowerDrugCosts for millions of Medicare beneficiaries — but also for the fact that today we are considering bills that will expand services that have for far too long been overlooked by the #Medicare program. https://t.co/83WMUQzqxy,2019-10-17 16:04:03,Twitter Web App,9,22

Today I rose to discuss the epidemic of #gunviolence in our nation.   In response to this epidemic the @EnergyCommerce Subcommittee on Health will meet in my district on October 3rd to examine gun violence as a public health issue something I have been calling for since 2017. https://t.co/MSLp0yKgnr,2019-09-19 15:14:18,Twitter for iPhone,3,10
In August Trump's DOJ launched an #antitrust probe targeting CA's emissions standards.

It has been more than 200 days since I voted in support of not one but TWO critically important background check bills – and yet they sit and collect dust on @SenateMajLdr McConnell's desk.

In response to this carnage I have introduced and re-introduced legislation that would help to reduce these #MassShootings such as the Blair Holt Firearm Licensing and Record of Sale Act.  I have reintroduced this bill in every Congress since 2007.   https://t.co/G5ajOdVlus,2019-09-18 16:40:23,Twitter for iPhone,2,3
Today I spoke on the House floor to address the scourge of mass shootings currently plaguing my community &amp; others in the U.S.  We have been rightfully disturbed by the tragedies in Ohio &amp; Texas but we seem increasingly numb to the violence taking place in cities like Chicago. https://t.co/6o8Mvjyitp,2019-09-18 16:32:50,Twitter for iPhone,3,12
The Gun Violence Archive (@GunDeaths) defines mass shootings as incidents where four or more people are injured/killed as a result of gunfire. Using this metric there have been 33 mass shootings in my district in the past 5 years and 8 so far this year.   This is unacceptable. https://t.co/x8AmYrZEdL,2019-09-18 14:56:08,Twitter Web App,8,17
@Ilhan @RepBonnie According to the Harvard Public Health Review "poverty predicts and is a major confounder of homicide rates nationally."

Today I addressed discriminatory housing policies that have contributed to the racial wealth gap in the U.S.  #DidYouKnow: Between 1934-68 black home buyers paid over $71K more for their homes than white homeowners resulting in $3.2 billion being stolen from black Chicagoans. https://t.co/8xWHKfTqM7,2019-09-11 15:52:41,Twitter for iPhone,3,10

@EnergyCommerce Regardless of the approach the goal is the same: we must do more to protect black mothers and I will support any bill that does that.

@EnergyCommerce It is therefore incumbent upon Congress to address the cause of these racial disparities and search for solutions that protect black mothers. One solution I’m interested in exploring is the use of Doulas or trained non-medical companions who support women through childbirth. 6/7 https://t.co/stzq4rtG7w,2019-09-10 21:52:55,Twitter Web App,4,16
@EnergyCommerce Sadly Melanie and Shalon’s deaths are connected by a disturbing stat:   Black mothers are 243% more likely to die from pregnancy/childbirth-related causes than white mothers and college educated black women are twice as likely to die as a white woman w/out a HS diploma. 5/7 https://t.co/F8zKl8E6Uy,2019-09-10 21:50:50,Twitter Web App,14,21

Today the @EnergyCommerce's Subcommittee on Health heard from Shalon’s mother and learned that Shalon's death was not only preventable but also a symptom of a persistent problem in our healthcare system:   Black mothers are dying at much higher rates than white mothers. 2/7 https://t.co/hhfsd6e18x,2019-09-10 21:04:24,Twitter Web App,7,19
This is Dr. Shalon Irving. She died less than a month after the birth of her daughter because doctors/caregivers did not take her symptoms seriously.   She was not poor. She was not uneducated. She was not uninsured.   She was black woman who deserved better. Know her name. 1/7 https://t.co/7J9LZxU0rh,2019-09-10 20:58:27,Twitter Web App,79,122
