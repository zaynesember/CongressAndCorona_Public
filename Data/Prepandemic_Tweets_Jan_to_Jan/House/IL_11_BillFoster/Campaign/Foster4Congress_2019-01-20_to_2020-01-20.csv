The one and only reason for President Trump's ban on transgender troops serving our country is bigotry. https://t.co/cpRCk4FEYo,2019-06-05 16:57:09,Twitter Web Client,2,4
I'm proud that Illinois affirmed a woman's right to choose what to do with her own body. We cannot go backwards on this critical issue.   https://t.co/LzM7mlyYwW,2019-06-03 18:31:19,Twitter Web Client,2,2
I know a lot of people who have won the Nobel Prize. 32 of them endorsed me when I ran for Congress. Rep. @AOC is a brilliant Member of Congress who cares about people. Anyone questioning her intelligence is the real dummy. https://t.co/qK8HLSCpLt,2019-05-30 17:11:24,Twitter Web Client,2,5
The Trump Administration's dangerous attacks on science will not go unanswered. We have an ethical obligation to use facts and science to inform our policy decisions and protect the next generation from the dangerous effects of climate change.  https://t.co/zLj8uKVk37,2019-05-28 19:23:20,Twitter Web Client,0,1
@realDonaldTrump your former "fixer" is going to jail for lying about payments you made to porn stars to keep them quiet about affairs. That sure sounds like a cover-up to me.  https://t.co/lnHgQMWbqJ,2019-05-22 21:40:58,Twitter Web Client,0,1
The Trump Administration's corrupt EPA is now changing the way it determines the health risks of pollution to cover up the immense harm burning fossil fuels does to local communities. I'm committed to fighting back against these dangerous changes.  https://t.co/e7xzuPTwBq,2019-05-22 18:13:45,Twitter Web Client,0,2
@realDonaldTrump's immigration policies will be remembered as a dark stain on our nation's history. It is completely unacceptable that another child seeking safety has died while in CBP custody.  https://t.co/iQTWOA8VyX,2019-05-21 16:34:51,Twitter Web Client,0,0
Anti-choice Republicans are racing to give Kavanaugh and the conservative #SCOTUS majority a chance to strike down #RoevWade. We must elect candidates at every level who will protect a women’s right to choose and make her own health care decisions.  https://t.co/dEdkSTCvdx,2019-05-15 15:37:28,Twitter Web Client,1,2
I had a great time supporting the Democratic Women of DuPage County this past weekend as they prepare to defend our majority in 2020! https://t.co/syxPOoNdp3,2019-05-14 16:48:22,Twitter Web Client,1,1
Secretary Mnuchin's refusal to release President Trump's tax returns in defiance of Congress is another blatant attack on our democratic norms and will help cement the Trump administration as the most corrupt in history.  https://t.co/EUItazvV6A,2019-05-07 16:21:27,Twitter Web Client,0,3
The numbers don't lie unlike the President and his EPA director. Climate change is affecting our communities right now and we need to pass new policies to address it or throw out the leaders who stand in the way.  https://t.co/l5rgDPa2Tu,2019-04-30 15:00:29,Twitter Web Client,1,0
I'm thrilled to see so many people with scientific backgrounds exploring runs for office. In this critical time for our country we need more scientists to step up and be engaged in our political process. https://t.co/r7wFiUohiz,2019-04-03 16:14:15,Twitter Web Client,0,1
Last night we saw more of the same from this President - falsehoods and blatant lies that will do nothing to move our country forward. https://t.co/CAp7EsFp5p,2019-02-06 17:17:26,Twitter Web Client,0,0
I was proud to attend and support @PPIAction 's annual Roe v. Wade Anniversary event last week. I will always do everything I can to support a woman's right to make her own healthcare decisions. https://t.co/LG4NOn7bIq,2019-01-23 15:56:10,Twitter Web Client,0,0
