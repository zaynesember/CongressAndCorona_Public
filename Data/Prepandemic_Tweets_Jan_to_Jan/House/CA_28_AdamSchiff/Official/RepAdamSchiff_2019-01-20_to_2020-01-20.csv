Americans are watching and they overwhelmingly support a fair trial. One that is fair to the President but also fair to the American people.   If Senators do not provide a fair trial with documents and witnesses history — and their constituents — will judge them harshly. https://t.co/AUsBOXNbrT,2020-01-19 19:13:35,Twitter Web App,10777,42768
Americans overwhelmingly want to see a fair trial.  That is the foundational issue on which everything else rests.  But will Senators allow witnesses and subpoena documents?   If Senators are true to the oath they have taken to impartially administer justice they must do so. https://t.co/9cHAOODgow,2020-01-19 17:23:57,Twitter Web App,7791,30082
The case against the President is simple and the evidence overwhelming.   He abused his power by soliciting foreign interference in our election withholding military aid from our ally and    Jeopardizing our national security elections and democracy.  https://t.co/pqJGVoCut8 https://t.co/yc26VGWLZj,2020-01-18 22:39:37,Twitter for iPad,13646,51156
If the Vice President believes all of the witnesses who testified before the House contradict Mr. Parnas why won’t he let the public see the supplemental testimony of his own staffer Jennifer Williams?

Mr. Parnas’ public interviews and documents shed light on the origins and key players in Trump's scheme.  His information Bolton's offer to testify and the GAO's finding of Trump's illegality all underscore the need for a fair trial.

The nonpartisan Government Accountability Office has found the Trump Administration broke the law by withholding military aid from Ukraine.  Trump’s willingness to break the law to coerce Ukraine to help him cheat in the next election shows the magnitude of his abuse of power. https://t.co/WgrJa3spcx,2020-01-16 16:13:14,Twitter Web App,15663,49752
The task before us is a grave but necessary one.  Donald J. Trump tried to get a foreign nation to help him cheat in the next election.  For that reason he was impeached.  And for that reason the only remedy is conviction and removal from office. https://t.co/rjT673texi,2020-01-15 19:05:04,Twitter Media Studio,11613,45337
I'm humbled by the solemn responsibility of serving as lead House Manager in the Senate impeachment trial.   Together the Managers will work on behalf of the American people in defense of our Constitution.   The House upheld our Constitutional duty. The Senate must do the same.,2020-01-15 15:58:13,Twitter Web App,15279,92117
Today we take the next step to #DefendOurDemocracy sending articles of impeachment to the Senate.   McConnell will have a choice: stand with the Constitution or with Trump’s cover-up.   Uphold the rule of law or help Trump undermine it.,2020-01-15 13:37:50,Twitter for iPhone,11751,48025
McConnell says the Senate shouldn’t hear witnesses or see documents as if it’s not a trial only an appeal.  But the trial has yet to begin:  These new materials show exactly why we need a fair trial — with documents and witnesses.  Not a coverup by the President and his men. https://t.co/KFgHlDdocf,2020-01-15 02:38:31,Twitter for iPhone,12465,37175
The overwhelming majority of the American people want to see a fair trial — fair to the president and fair to the public.  But Mitch McConnell wants to block witnesses and documents an unprecedented attempt to obscure the truth.  That's not a fair trial. It's a cover up. https://t.co/zy2LBHWKrM,2020-01-14 17:47:46,Twitter Web App,9826,26680
The Russians appear to be at it again. According to a new report they’re hacking information that could be a prelude to more election interference in 2020.  And again it appears aimed to help Trump.

Trump just tweeted:  “I stand stronger than anyone in protecting your Healthcare with Pre- Existing Conditions.”  How absurd.

Impeachment isn't about politics or poll numbers.  It's about our duty to our country.  President Trump abused the powers of his office to pressure Ukraine to help him cheat in the next election.  The House upheld our Constitutional duty. It’s up to the Senate to do the same. https://t.co/nwnnUDlGKS,2020-01-13 23:30:00,Twitter Media Studio,6777,26014
Soleimani was undoubtedly an evil man.  But killing him brought us to the brink of war and I believe made Americans less safe.  The intelligence I’ve seen doesn't justify it.

Trump has made it clear he wants no trial no witnesses no documents no verdict.  He wants the case dismissed so Americans never know the extent of his efforts to get Ukraine to help him cheat in the election.  But the Senators must decide: will they insist on a fair trial? https://t.co/qBnmArPdkv,2020-01-12 23:22:29,Twitter for iPhone,13972,50798
Americans overwhelmingly want a fair trial in the Senate fair to the President and fair to the people.  If McConnell succeeds in blocking witnesses and documents in the Senate it will be the first such trial in history.  That's not a trial. Just a cover up. https://t.co/b1UwGVMQxY,2020-01-12 20:30:00,Twitter Media Studio,12484,43463
Trump said on Fox that the intelligence showed Iran plotting against four of our embassies.  As a member of the Gang of 8 that was news to me.

I’ve been a member of the Intel Committee for over a decade.  Been briefed hundreds of times on threats — some imminent some not. When targeting a top gov’t official for killing:  “We don’t know precisely when and we don’t know precisely where” does not constitute “imminent.” https://t.co/1sL8uEVDWI,2020-01-10 15:43:33,Twitter for iPad,17855,57944
A Senate trial should be like any other trial.  Senators should hear from witnesses. Senators should see the documents.   Only then can they make the best possible decision regarding the President's misconduct.  Once upon a time Mitch McConnell felt the same. https://t.co/ilblPGgwZM,2020-01-10 13:27:22,Twitter Media Studio,24542,64452
The Constitution is clear:  Congress—not the President—has the power to declare war.  The House JUST voted to reassert our constitutional duty and rein in a reckless president.

Trump doesn’t want the public to how much taxpayers are spending on his:  ❌ Golfing ❌ Hotel visits ❌ Travel   You get the idea.

Why is a disorganized and chaotic Administration such a danger to national security?

A dangerous and provocative decision to target a top Iranian official for killing.  Threats to bomb cultural sites and use disproportionate force.  These are the acts of a President with no functional national security process.

Compelled by our duty to Constitution and country the House impeached President Donald Trump for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.  The Senate must now do its duty and conduct a fair trial.  These are the key facts you need to remember about Trump's misconduct: https://t.co/JgXv5IUnwK,2020-01-06 20:05:14,Twitter Media Studio,12823,38267
Bolton is an important witness to misconduct involving Ukraine that he called a “drug deal.”  Bolton refused to testify in the House following Trump’s orders.  Now he is willing to come forward. The Senate must allow testimony from him Mulvaney and others. The coverup must end. https://t.co/3JCaw8W8y3,2020-01-06 18:23:09,Twitter Web App,10711,39911
Here are the questions every Senator must ask themselves:  Do we want the American people to see and hear the full evidence including documents and witnesses?  Do we want a real trial? Or do we want a coverup?  It’s really that simple. https://t.co/9396pgZww0,2020-01-05 20:30:00,Twitter Media Studio,13890,47892
After seeing the intel I don’t believe it supports conclusion that killing Soleimani will stop Iranian plotting or reduce risk to American lives.

It was a reckless move. https://t.co/yx33Q7KVqY,2020-01-05 18:03:19,Twitter Media Studio,15681,51203
As additional documents are revealed and new information about Trump’s abuse of power comes to light we learn more and more about the extent of his cover-up.

The question is: Should we? https://t.co/D9kXpcm9lm,2019-12-03 22:29:43,Twitter Media Studio,17074,60873
Today @HouseIntel released our official report on the impeachment inquiry into President Donald J. Trump. Tune in live as I discuss the significant evidence our inquiry uncovered of Trump’s Ukraine misconduct and obstruction of Congress. https://t.co/B6FO4yFU3C,2019-12-03 20:05:09,Periscope,4571,15133
The impeachment inquiry uncovered overwhelming and uncontested evidence that President Trump abused the powers of his office to solicit foreign interference in our election for his own personal political gain.  No one is above the law.  Read our report: https://t.co/6Hx0PZ48yw,2019-12-03 18:51:54,Twitter Web App,26474,83227
Evidence of Trump's obstruction of Congress is overwhelming.  If we allow it to succeed it will mean future presidents can simply ignore Congressional subpoenas &amp; oversight  Fundamentally altering the balance of power and paving the way for unchecked corruption and malfeasance. https://t.co/idrsJtpfWp,2019-12-03 14:17:27,Twitter Media Studio,11532,38895
President Trump has sought foreign intervention in US elections—twice.  Even in the midst of this impeachment inquiry Trump declared: not only should Ukraine investigate the Bidens but China should too.  He poses a real and present danger to the integrity of the next election. https://t.co/7u9C8Q4B52,2019-12-03 03:23:35,Twitter Media Studio,12291,41177
The GOP report ignores voluminous evidence Trump used his office to press Ukraine into investigating Biden by withholding military aid and a White House meeting.  They say this is just Trump’s “outside the beltway” thinking. It’s more accurately outside the law and Constitution. https://t.co/jBNdd6knWP,2019-12-02 23:38:17,Twitter Web App,10616,35991
In addition to fulfilling our Constitutional obligation to conduct oversight of the Executive Branch  House Democrats have passed nearly 400 bills to raise wages lower health care costs support veterans and more.

There's only one thing less plausible than the claim Trump was actually concerned with corruption in Ukraine as opposed to getting dirt on the Bidens:  That he’s more concerned about future presidents than he is about concealing evidence of his own misconduct.  No one buys it. https://t.co/UTzoGAIFQ1,2019-11-26 22:02:18,Twitter for iPhone,17399,73958
Last month the House recognized the Armenian Genocide by an overwhelming bipartisan vote.  @SenatorMenendez and @TedCruz have been working to get the Senate to join us.

Trump has now twice sought foreign interference in our elections to help him politically first from Russia and now from Ukraine.  This president threatens the integrity of our elections and Congress must consider the remedy.  It cannot wait. The urgency is real. https://t.co/Fpc5azfvfh,2019-11-25 20:02:31,Twitter Media Studio,15803,57917
Republicans farcically claim there’s no direct evidence that Trump withheld aid to get political investigations.  The problem? His own chief of staff admitted it on live TV.  It’s clear: Trump wanted to use military aid as leverage to get Ukraine to do his political dirty work. https://t.co/hMU8h5fg9B,2019-11-25 17:53:01,Twitter Media Studio,5132,17950
If we allow Trump’s obstruction of Congress to succeed it will have enduring consequences.  It will mean a future Congress will be unable to conduct meaningful oversight of a president of either party.

The evidence of Trump's misconduct is already overwhelming despite his effort to block every witness from testifying and obstruct every document request.  The facts are not contested. The President violated his oath of office.  The question now is: will we observe our own? https://t.co/DUvxkuC4Al,2019-11-24 16:39:55,Twitter Media Studio,17675,64181
We heard that Donald Trump only cares about the big stuff that helps him personally.  The question now is — what do we care about? The Constitution? Our oath of office?  Or merely our party.

Some of Trump's defenders have accused Lt. Col. Vindman—a Purple Heart recipient—of disloyalty to country.   I asked Dr. Hill a fellow immigrant her response to these scurrilous attacks:  "This is a country of immigrants...

Let’s judge Trump’s conduct by his words and deeds:  Recalls Ambassador Yovanovitch after she’s falsely smeared.  Praises Ukraine’s corrupt former prosecutor.  Asks Ukraine to investigate his rival.  Holds up aid until it does.  That’s not anti-corruption.  Just corruption. https://t.co/RK6Xa4mJMU,2019-11-21 02:33:12,Twitter Media Studio,15761,63584

This all comes back to President Donald J. Trump.  He is the one who prevented the White House meeting. He is the one who withheld the military assistance. He is the one who asked Ukraine's President to investigate his opponent.   He is the one who violated his oath. https://t.co/OAljU7H6Em,2019-11-20 22:23:42,Twitter Media Studio,21170,81896
Republicans seem to be under the impression that unless the president spoke the words "I am bribing Ukraine" there's no evidence of bribery or misconduct.  Nonetheless Sondland has provided significant evidence of precisely that conditionality for both the WH meeting and aid. https://t.co/LGAD15sVHh,2019-11-20 21:41:10,Twitter Media Studio,12243,49478
Sondland confirms that the Ukraine scheme was a quid pro quo: the conditioning of official acts a WH meeting and military aid for something of great value to the president.  It goes right to the heart of the issue of bribery and other potential high crimes and misdemeanors. https://t.co/FGOiviza85,2019-11-20 16:56:41,Twitter Media Studio,13569,49357
If the President abused his power and sought to condition coerce extort or bribe an ally into conducting investigations to aid his reelection and did so by withholding official acts  We must decide: is this conduct compatible with the office of the presidency? https://t.co/8iX15RnmGj,2019-11-20 15:03:33,Twitter Media Studio,7885,32092

The question is: Are we prepared to accept that a president can leverage official acts to get an investigation of a political rival?   Our Founding Fathers drafted the remedy of impeachment so we would have a mechanism when corruption comes from the highest office in the land. https://t.co/D2OxRRwVPN,2019-11-20 02:42:14,Twitter Media Studio,15646,62868
My Republican colleagues argue that aid is held up all the time for all sorts of reasons.  I asked Volker and Morrison if they had ever seen military aid withheld because a president wanted investigations into a political rival.  Volker: "No I have not seen that" Morrison: "No" https://t.co/5iCFYYFhcu,2019-11-20 00:07:01,Twitter Media Studio,14430,53469
We will now hear from Kurt Volker and Tim Morrison.  Volker has testified no president should ever ask a foreign leader to interfere in a US election.  Morrison will confirm Sondland told the Ukrainians they needed to do so to get vital aid.

My Republican colleagues suggest that since Trump's Ukraine scheme failed since someone blew the whistle and the aid was ultimately released that it doesn’t really matter if he tried to bribe a foreign power with military aid.   The Constitution says otherwise. https://t.co/0V3OdIhU3r,2019-11-19 20:16:23,Twitter Media Studio,17905,66258
My Republican colleagues may try to muddy the waters but this fact is undisputed:  On the July 25 call Trump asked Zelensky to investigate the Bidens.  There's no ambiguity about it.  And Lt. Col.

Lt. Col. Vindman and Ms. Williams were both on the now infamous July 25th phone call and heard Trump ask Zelensky to investigate the Bidens.  They also heard Zelensky mention Burisma a fact left out of the call record.

Let's set the record straight:  Trump wasn't working to help Ukraine root out corruption.  On the July 25 call he didn't ask Zelensky about any issue related to Ukraine's oligarchs.

I understand why Trump doesn’t want more witnesses testifying.  But I can’t understand why my GOP colleagues are enabling his obstruction.  Where is their duty to this institution?

The emoluments clause isn't "phony" — it’s in the Constitution.  He is not "in charge of the Hatch Act."

Homelessness in America is a crisis and there’s no simple solution. But this much is simple: Every person deserves a safe and dignified space to call home.  If Trump's sudden interest is genuine there's plenty he can do to make a difference.,2019-09-13 18:39:52,Twitter Web App,394,2071
As @LAMayor wrote "homeless Americans share one thing in common — trauma." Rather than criminalizing homelessness the President could increase funding for mental health and substance abuse treatment programs.,2019-09-13 18:39:51,Twitter Web App,455,2149
I also recently introduced a bill — H.R. 4239 the Affordable Housing Incentive Act — which creates tax incentives for property owners who sell to public housing agencies thereby increasing the stock of affordable housing options.  Mr. President I'd love to have your support.,2019-09-13 18:39:51,Twitter Web App,197,938
At the federal level the President could announce his support for @RepMaxineWaters' bill — H.R. 1856 the Ending Homelessness Act of 2019 — which would provide $13.7 billion in emergency relief funding to address homelessness.  But so far he's been silent on this bill.,2019-09-13 18:39:51,Twitter Web App,274,1068
Rather than launching partisan attacks on California cities Trump could learn from leaders and community groups on the front lines of addressing homelessness.

Mueller was asked “Did you actually totally exonerate the president?"  He responded simply “No” and said “The president was not exculpated.”  When asked if it was true Trump could be charged when he leaves office Mueller responded simply “True.”  That’s pretty clear cut.,2019-07-24 13:47:29,TweetDeck,30760,108520

The mystery of how Jared Kushner was granted a top secret security clearance despite myriad financial entanglements and undisclosed foreign meetings has been solved:  His father in law ordered it.  It’s called clearance by nepotism and a serious abuse that endangers our security. https://t.co/XMt8HmlvuU,2019-03-01 00:02:47,Twitter for iPhone,24947,73738
Walking away from the summit was better than making a bad deal. It’s also the result of a poorly planned strategy.  But accepting Kim’s denial of involvement in Warmbier’s death?

This double standard won’t cut it.
