The president could hardly make it any clearer that he views the presidency as an opportunity to make money and further his business interests. This shameless plug for his golf course is only the latest debasement of his office. What’s next a Trump wine review? https://t.co/Gd1hnveCj1,2019-03-03 02:50:25,Twitter for iPhone,3462,11316

Trump on Putin: "He said he didn't meddle” in our election  On MBS: He “vehemently denies” arranging Khashoggi's murder  On Kim: “I will take him at his word” on Otto Warmbier's death  Trump has yet to find a dictator he won't trust over our own intel agencies  Or common sense.,2019-03-01 00:00:03,Twitter Web Client,7799,25146
This week scientists reached “gold standard” confidence that climate change is man-made and catastrophic.  Also this week Trump concocted a panel of climate skeptics to undermine the scientific consensus.  That's why Congress must lead on climate change and think big. https://t.co/F2SWfUOwkl,2019-02-27 21:54:31,Twitter Web Client,1495,4438
It’s not about Democrats or Republicans. It’s not about the border. It’s about the Constitution’s separation of powers.

No Mr. President the fraud that happened was ELECTION fraud. In North Carolina.   Different party different state different problem.  And your false claims about California — that’s a different kind of fraud altogether. https://t.co/qm2eC5Aj7P,2019-02-26 14:27:32,Twitter for iPhone,2212,6549
Democrats offer an aggressive blueprint for developing renewable energy and creating millions of new jobs.  Trump backs out of the Paris accords names a climate denier to a climate commission and an oil and gas lobbyist as Secretary of Interior.

The Justice Department cannot take the position that a sitting president can’t be indicted and at the same time withhold evidence of any wrongdoing.  That would amount to immunity.

Trump was required to submit a report to Congress on the killing of Jamal Khashoggi – he refused.  Republicans have yet to ask why.

Democrats are serious about confronting climate change harnessing American ingenuity to protect the planet with a Green New Deal.

President Trump took pride in announcing a shutdown and claiming it as his own. He has the power to end it anytime he wants and put an end to the suffering it has caused.  That’s what a real president would do.   But then a real president wouldn’t have done this to begin with. https://t.co/WuBVDchxFB,2019-01-20 23:00:33,Twitter for iPhone,2248,5667
Trump’s shutdown isn’t about security. It’s about his fraudulent promise that Mexico was going to pay for a “big beautiful wall.”  Now he says taxpayers must foot the bill but they’ll be magically reimbursed.  No one is fooled. Trump would merely replace one fraud with another.,2019-01-20 18:57:50,Twitter for iPhone,6302,20633
