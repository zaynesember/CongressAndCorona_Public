THIS WEEK: After withholding "urgent" impeachment articles from the Senate for 28 days Speaker Pelosi FINALLY allowed a vote to move the process forward.   Meanwhile...new economic victories thanks to @POTUS: ✅ USMCA clears the Senate ✅ Phase 1 of China Trade Deal signed https://t.co/8vz9bRDpe5,2020-01-16 18:01:55,Twitter Media Studio,16,44
While Democrats spend their time further politicizing impeachment @POTUS is doing the work of the American people today delivering another HISTORIC trade win for job creators workers and the economy. https://t.co/E5iydHrQwz,2020-01-15 22:15:08,Twitter Media Studio,42,87
Four weeks later @SpeakerPelosi finally allowed a vote to actually send so-called urgent impeachment articles to the Senate. After trying to dictate terms of the trial it's clear @HouseDemocrats know they failed to prove their case against @POTUS.,2020-01-15 19:23:38,Twitter for iPhone,10,35
I applaud @POTUS for negotiating and delivering yet another trade win for American job creators and workers! https://t.co/oYOrva45O1,2020-01-15 16:42:09,Twitter for iPhone,6,25
WATCH: Earlier today I filmed a recap of the first week back in legislative session this year. Meaningful legislating in the Democrat-controlled House was lacking but partisan drama and political games were not in short supply. https://t.co/FCHvanZ1hH,2020-01-10 18:16:24,Twitter Web App,3,11
During last night's Rules hearing on a war powers resolution coming to the floor today I reminded everyone: @POTUS taking out a terrorist responsible for killing hundreds of Americans - and who was plotting to kill more - is NOT the same thing as waging war on Iran. https://t.co/uHrX43ejU5,2020-01-09 16:03:15,Twitter Media Studio,191,624
The war powers resolution by @HouseDemocrats says more about their opposition to @POTUS than exercising congressional authority. Article II of the Constitution clearly gives the president legal authority to use DEFENSIVE military force in response to imminent threats to the U.S. https://t.co/iBK7uKCL7G,2020-01-09 02:42:43,Twitter Media Studio,46,133

After running a totally partisan and closed impeachment process in the House @SpeakerPelosi now wants an open and bipartisan process in the Senate? That is the height of political hypocrisy! -TC,2019-12-22 18:07:22,Twitter Web App,77,400
It's been a roller coaster of a week. Apart from the news dominating the partisan vote on articles of impeachment last night the House actually got a lot of bipartisan work done this week. More in my weekly chat ⬇️ https://t.co/EQUl6au8wB,2019-12-19 22:02:37,Twitter Web App,6,18

Democrats' rush to impeach @POTUS using a flawed &amp; unfair process sets a precedent that runs the risk of legitimizing impeachment as an acceptable weapon that can now be used in partisan political warfare.

I will neither participate in nor support efforts that use the tools of the House as a one-sided weapon to punish the president while ignoring the reckless rhetoric of so many of his Democratic critics.

Today @POTUS posthumously awarded Staff Sgt. Travis Atkins with the Medal of Honor. The selfless and courageous actions Atkins took during the Iraq War are now rightly categorized among the most heroic in American military history. https://t.co/KzGk3BpQM0,2019-03-27 22:43:03,Twitter for iPhone,3,17

To tackle our nation's burden of debt tough decisions and careful solutions are required. But the solutions must include reforms to save and sustain the mandatory programs serving many vulnerable Americans.,2019-03-20 16:49:28,Twitter for iPhone,1,7
The federal government does not have a revenue problem it has a mandatory spending problem. In 1965 mandatory accounted for 34% of the budget. Last year it made up more than two-thirds. By 2028 that figure is projected to reach 77%. https://t.co/aHcK2r17e2,2019-03-20 16:49:28,Twitter for iPhone,1,6

I was deeply saddened to hear about the horrific tragedy in New Zealand this morning. As someone who has had the privilege of visiting Christchurch I know what a welcoming and caring community it is.

While I don’t support all of the president’s #budget recommendations for FY 2020 I think he is on the right track to emphasize defense funding and to restrain some domestic spending. My full statement: https://t.co/yImDO6LWcn,2019-03-12 22:20:13,Twitter Web Client,4,11
Despite claims to the contrary the Democrats' #HR1 passed last week is not a bill to ensure more American citizens exercise their right to vote or participate in making their views heard. Read more: https://t.co/8vKaOy5XAY,2019-03-11 15:25:09,Twitter Web Client,2,14
In Oklahoma where our election system is seen as highly successful and widely recognized #HR1's proposed mandates would needlessly increase the cost of elections statewide and in every county.,2019-03-08 21:00:36,Twitter Web Client,5,8
#HR1 would disrupt and infringe upon the role states play in conducting their own elections. While some states are clearly more successful than others it is alarming that Democrats want to force our 50 separate and unique states to operate under the same guidelines.,2019-03-08 21:00:35,Twitter Web Client,7,12
Today the House voted on #HR1 a shameful Democratic power grab which would essentially create a welfare program for politicians and candidates on the taxpayer dime. I opposed the bill. https://t.co/aEqi6h17sc,2019-03-08 20:45:36,Twitter Web Client,3,16
The House is preparing to vote on #HR1. Earlier this week I made remarks about why this is such an enormously misguided piece of legislation from Democrats. https://t.co/ZjPa5cXNAg,2019-03-08 15:06:06,Twitter Web Client,241,536
This is an important forum for members. Earlier today I appreciated having the opportunity to share my views and ideas for getting our nation’s long-term fiscal house in order. https://t.co/LDhECwqn4q,2019-03-06 23:26:52,Twitter for iPhone,2,8

In the weeks ahead it is critical that Democrats stay true to their promise of working with Republicans and @POTUS on solutions for border security. I believe we can find a compromise that both sides agree on and which reflects the views of the American people.,2019-01-25 22:06:12,Twitter Web Client,2,10
Through his announcement today @POTUS demonstrated yet again that he is willing to negotiate in good faith and Democrats are now out of excuses for refusing to do so as well.,2019-01-25 22:06:12,Twitter Web Client,3,10
I am relieved that agreement has been reached to reopen the government and pay the hundreds of thousands of federal workers suffering as a result. Their commitment despite this hardship has been tremendous.,2019-01-25 22:06:11,Twitter Web Client,2,16
