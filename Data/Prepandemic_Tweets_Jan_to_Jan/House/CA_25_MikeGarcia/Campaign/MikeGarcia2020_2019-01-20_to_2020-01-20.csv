Also I learned that every time leftist politicians propose or pass laws that promise “free stuff” like free college &amp; healthcare (like the CA Medi-Cal bill) border crossings actually SPIKE.

The reality is that Israel is one of the most critical allies to the US and it should be respected as such. All members of Congress should want to visit. But she decided to go to El Salvador instead. Why? Because those are the people who benefit most from her socialist programs.,2019-08-16 01:09:49,Twitter Web App,16,11
Another example of Katie Hill believing her constituents are uninformed. And instead spewing meaningless rhetoric. We do remember the anti-Semitic comments made by Omar.

In nearly twenty years of service as a Navy Fighter Pilot we learned discipline honor and respect. Unfortunately our own Congresswoman simply lacks all three. Our district and our nation deserve better.  #TakeBackOurDistrict #ElectMikeGarcia #aRepublican4All,2019-07-25 18:15:05,Twitter Web App,9,25
looking up to @SpeakerPelosi as her 'hero' than she does serving the people of her district. Hill has shown she desires to be a cable news celebrity espousing extreme views to placate her liberal donors in San Francisco and New York City.,2019-07-25 18:15:04,Twitter Web App,2,12
Sadly this is not the first time Representative Hill has used such polarizing language.  In her short time in office she has cared more about taking cues from colleagues such as socialists @RepAOC  and @Ilhan and,2019-07-25 18:15:04,Twitter Web App,2,12
Representative Katie Hill’s divisive and dangerous rhetoric has gone too far. Calling the President a ‘criminal’ after countless investigations and millions in wasted taxpayer dollars proved otherwise is rhetoric unbecoming of an elected representative of the people. https://t.co/BVRlppMCRu,2019-07-25 18:15:04,Twitter Web App,48,72

@RepKatieHill and her Democrat peers are using this defense budget for political messaging rather than protecting our nation and ensuring our troops are taken care of.  Unacceptable! https://t.co/0Pb7qlJI7s https://t.co/gMpVcpP6kj,2019-07-19 01:59:00,Twitter Web Client,1,1

Tax cuts are working for the country but CA Taxpayers are being unfairly punished for their zip code. At the same time Californians are getting squeezed every day by higher property &amp; gas taxes.

ICYMI: so-called moderate @KatieHill4CA is drawing plenty of comparisons to @SpeakerPelosi -- @RepAdamSchiff says "the speaker looks at Katie like a younger version of herself."
