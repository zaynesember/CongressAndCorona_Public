It's been 175 days since the House acted to end gun violence and passed #HR8 and #HR1112. How much longer do the American people have to wait for @senatemajldr McConnell to hold a vote? #DoSomething,2019-08-20 17:46:25,Twitter Web App,25,39
Maybe if we had run a background check on the President we wouldn't be stuck with such a mean incompetent person in the White House.  How utterly unsurprising. Of course we need strong background checks on all gun sales - like the House passed in #HR8. https://t.co/X5SBpWgszw,2019-08-19 22:53:21,Twitter for iPhone,4,10

This day feels surreal for me. In 2016 I lost my nephew Ian to a fentanyl overdose at the age of 24 after five years of working with him to get treatment from some of the best programs and therapists possible.  No family deserves to suffer the loss of a loved one to addiction.,2019-02-14 18:54:55,Twitter Web Client,6,21
The numbers are devastating:  - 192 people die every day from drug overdoses - Last year over 70000 people died from drug overdoses - Americans are now more likely to die from an opioid overdose than a car crash  This cannot continue. We must come together to end this crisis.,2019-02-14 18:54:55,Twitter Web Client,11,22
This bipartisan group of freshmen will bring fresh eyes to one of the most devastating crises facing our country. We will:  - Learn from experts and stakeholders - Visit institutions focusing on research and treatment - Promote legislation to tackle the epidemic,2019-02-14 18:54:54,Twitter Web Client,5,19
It’s time to take action.

One of the students who lost his life that day was Joaquin "Guac" Oliver. This 3D statue shows him with a flower in his hand a tribute to the Valentine's Day gift he had for his girlfriend.

What is happening in Yemen must end. Over 60000 lives have been lost and the impact is real and painful.  I spoke today in support of the Resolution to remove U.S. Armed Forces from Yemen.

To be clear AIPAC is a bipartisan organization that supports the US-Israel relationship and Israel is a progressive democratic beacon of light in the Middle East. Comparing AIPAC to the NRA shows a serious lack of listening and learning.,2019-02-11 21:17:28,Twitter Web Client,3,20
The U.S. and Israel have a strong bond because of our shared democratic interests and values and the use of prejudicial tropes is both deeply hurtful and ill-informed. I agree with @SpeakerPelosi that Rep. Omar should apologize. https://t.co/xhoI0HmDe3,2019-02-11 20:09:32,Twitter Web Client,4,9
