Today we think about the dream that Martin Luther King Jr. envisioned for our country where people of all skin colors religions and creeds could come together as a nation. This dream should be a guide for all of us as we strive for equality diversity and inclusivity.,2019-01-21 16:51:04,Twitter for iPhone,3,19
I had a really productive conversation today with leaders in the Latino community. We talked about early childhood education comprehensive immigration reform and getting the government open. I’m looking forward to working with this group to solve some of these problems. https://t.co/lPj0tDHNnC,2019-01-20 21:22:34,Twitter for iPhone,3,22
