Hi @RepDanCrenshaw-I wanted to say that #HR8 does have a self defense exception.  Private sales w/o background checks are legal. Making them illegal makes it safer for law abiding citizens to transfer their guns to other law abiding citizens.  Wish we could have gotten your vote. https://t.co/YKdSoBsvU7,2019-02-27 21:05:28,Twitter for iPhone,35,140
It was a powerful moment as I voted for the first major gun safety bill in decades &amp; saw the House gallery filled w/ advocates who have fought for this moment for years.  After Sandy Hook Pulse Las Vegas daily gun violence and especially after Parkland finally we acted. #HR8,2019-02-27 21:00:35,Twitter Web Client,483,3839
Today marks a dramatic shift in the gun violence movement. As I speak on the House floor about HR8 I proudly wear the scarf of @RepLucyMcbath who is a courageous leader on this issue and I am grateful for her work to help get this done. https://t.co/iiwIZsvNii,2019-02-27 20:24:40,Twitter Media Studio,268,1499

SOON: I’ll be joining @msnbc @hardball with @SteveKornacki to talk more about this deeply troubling story.  @HHSGov has a lot of questions to answer on how they protect minors in their custody from sexual assault. https://t.co/n52yD911Oq,2019-02-27 00:04:20,Twitter for iPhone,69,195
I am voting to protect our communities keep our kids safe and keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people. It is time for change and I’m excited to finally have a chance to tackle the gun violence crisis. #HR8 https://t.co/bLXYgII5f6,2019-02-26 19:48:38,Twitter for iPhone,75,372
Audrey is a Hugh school student that lives in Chicago. She is a brave advocate for gun reform and she is calling on elected officials to do their job and pass background checks legislation.   Thank you Audrey. #HR8 https://t.co/mZAnziahc1,2019-02-26 18:42:01,Twitter for iPhone,16,67

With the number of allegations each year roughly breaking down to one sexual assault per week for the last three years clearly this Administration is not equipped to keep these children safe inside their facilities. This is outrageous and disgraceful.   We demand answers. https://t.co/r5yENffCvW,2019-02-26 18:36:07,Twitter Media Studio,837,1743

I’ve waited too long to vote YES on basic gun safety bills.   I will proudly do so this week.   Trump’s veto threat shows that he stands with gun corporations over the American people who broadly support background checks and don’t have a corrupt view of 2A.,2019-02-26 03:49:43,Twitter for iPhone,961,5045
I remember that day shortly after Parkland. President Trump told a small group of Members of Congress that Republican senators who were standing in the way of common-sense gun safety laws were afraid of the NRA.   Today?  Donald Trump is afraid. https://t.co/rk8R0hupqX,2019-02-26 03:44:44,Twitter for iPhone,82,238

The Trump Administration pretends that the option to buy a gun online without a background check is the only thing preserving the 2nd Amendment.   That is a dangerous extremist position. https://t.co/F8Chsnof9B,2019-02-26 01:08:35,Twitter for iPhone,109,266
Should we “do something” to stop 40000 gun deaths per year?  Yes.   Can we have gun rights at the same time we have strong &amp; effective gun safety laws?  Yes.   Will @dloesch do everything she can to stop change that will save lives?  Sadly yes.,2019-02-25 23:07:07,Twitter for iPhone,2587,11396
The House will finally take action toward peace this week.   Looking forward to casting my vote in favor of universal background checks on all gun sales. #HR8 https://t.co/obcnRby96a,2019-02-25 21:31:53,Twitter for iPhone,36,167
Background checks are bipartisan and necessary. This week the House will vote on implementing universal background checks and I am proud to say that I will be voting YES. #HR8,2019-02-25 20:25:53,Twitter for iPhone,118,496
Returning democracy to the hands of the people means getting big money out of our system.

After Pulse we shut down the House floor to demand action on gun violence.   After Parkland we marched to demand action on gun violence.   This week we will vote to require background checks on all gun sales.   I’m voting YES on #HR8,2019-02-25 03:41:18,Twitter for iPhone,4297,27403

Allowing gun sales without background checks has deadly consequences.   In Charleston.   In Sutherland Springs.   In Aurora.   We’ve got to give law enforcement the time and the tools to conduct background checks &amp; prevent prohibited sales. https://t.co/Ah2TQXQji4,2019-02-21 14:22:04,Twitter for iPhone,722,2153
Law enforcement understands the importance of making animal cruelty a law. In one survey 71% of domestic violence victims said their abuser also attacked their pets.

President Trump would rather steal money from our military which actually fights national security threats for his made-up national emergency.
