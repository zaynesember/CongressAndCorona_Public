Tonight’s vote comes 56 days after Pres. Trump requested a package to deal with the humanitarian crisis. In that time Speaker Pelosi has refused to vote on this package 17 times while May saw 140000 migrants apprehended at the border- a 229% increase compared to May 2018.,2019-06-26 01:37:37,Twitter for iPhone,9,26

Instead of one-size-fits-all health care states &amp; people deserve flexibility to have the most affordable &amp; quality care possible while protecting pre-existing conditions. Dems should stop playing politics with misleading bill titles &amp; work w/ us on solutions to fix health care.,2019-05-09 21:51:51,Twitter Web Client,2,9
Today's vote has nothing to do with protecting pre-existing conditions (which Republicans have repeatedly called for and voted to protect).

The Paris Agreement put the U.S. at a disadvantage to countries like China and the Green New Deal would cost $93 trillion.
