Washington spends taxpayer dollars without counting the full cost.    @SenMikeLee @RepEdCase and I are requesting that Congress weigh the real price of legislation instead of  ignoring costs to make new programs seem like they’re not as expensive.   https://t.co/5bwwn1OJIr,2020-01-16 15:59:25,Twitter Web App,15,55

I can tell you there's a bipartisan effort in Congress to address constitutional war powers authority but the resolution at hand today is simply a reactionary effort by Speaker Pelosi to criticize the president’s proper and decisive actions against Iranian aggression.,2020-01-09 23:33:37,Twitter Web App,16,37

Historically impeachment proceedings have been very deliberate defined and transparent but this investigation was conducted in a top-secret room in the basement of the Capitol having neither bipartisan support nor the basic norms of due process and fairness. (2/2),2019-12-19 01:47:32,Twitter Web App,93,235
Despite unfair and even at times secret hearings this impeachment investigation uncovered no evidence that the president committed impeachable offenses. This is a single-party effort in Congress to remove a sitting president. (1/2),2019-12-19 01:47:32,Twitter Web App,390,1505
I voted no.   It’s a basic duty of Congress to maintain a budget cut the deficit and provide a long-term spending plan and the votes today did not accomplish any of those goals.

Obamacare passed with the promise that taxpayers wouldn't have to subsidize abortion. Yet hidden abortion surcharges were still included.
