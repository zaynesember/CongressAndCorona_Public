Hours after 2800 workers in my home state of Kansas found out they lost their jobs Boeing's former CEO received a $62 million payout.   That's not accountability. And it's all the more reason why we need to continue our investigation in @TransportDems. https://t.co/Ea0NERi0GN,2020-01-13 16:19:28,Twitter Web App,1317,2321

These messages are incredibly disturbing and show a coordinated effort inside Boeing to deceive the public and federal regulators who are in place to keep passengers safe.

We know firsthand in Kansas what happens when policy like this is passed. Just last year the KS leg passed a bill allowing adoption agencies to deny services to LGBTQ parents despite the foster care system already being overwhelmed.  It was wrong then - and it's wrong now. 3/5,2019-11-05 16:02:33,Twitter Web App,12,83
This is the latest in a long line of attacks against the LGBTQ community from this Administration but this rule is particularly appalling as it affects our most vulnerable population – our children.   Every child deserves a stable safe and loving home. 2/5,2019-11-05 16:02:33,Twitter Web App,18,89
It’s unacceptable that this Administration is proposing a rule allowing foster care and adoption agencies to discriminate against LGBTQ parents at the expense of the American taxpayer no less. 1/5  https://t.co/mQ711etFA2,2019-11-05 16:02:33,Twitter Web App,169,518
