It’s also #TeacherAppreciationWeek - a good reminder to #ThankATeacher. Education is the backbone of our community and our economy - none of that would work without our teachers. https://t.co/e9SNEOw2Rf,2019-05-07 15:47:41,Twitter for iPhone,50,217

There are so many barriers to entry for a candidate like me. But with support from @emilyslist we elected the most diverse House in history with more women than ever before.

#KS03 is a top target for @GOP &amp; special interests in 2020. To continue our progress on healthcare &amp; education &amp; issues critical to our community we can’t waste time. These dedicated vols are already hard at work preparing for the next election. That’s how we do on #TeamSharice! https://t.co/x1rV4JQtq4,2019-02-20 00:50:13,Twitter for iPhone,64,357
