I don’t view issues through a partisan lens. So much of government gridlock is the result of an unwillingness to work with people of the other political party.

Over 85k children have died tens of millions w/o food &amp; water creating worst humanitarian crisis in a generation — supported by the US and never authorized by Congress. This must end now. https://t.co/TXYyZ9abW7,2019-01-30 22:27:37,Twitter Web App,1168,2704
This could only happen as a result of being willing to meet and talk with not just friends but adversaries to pursue peace. https://t.co/S9h4VSrKfL,2019-01-30 15:04:31,Sprout Social,249,1119
This is so heartbreaking. @JussieSmollett you are not alone - we are with you. We must stand up and condemn this hate bigotry &amp; violence wherever it rears its ugly head. No one should live in fear because of the color of their skin or who they love.,2019-01-30 01:51:08,Twitter Web Client,304,1656

It’s about the oil … again.   Bolton just exposed real motive for intervention in Venezuela: "We're in conversation with major American companies now...It would make a difference if we could have American companies produce the oil in Venezuela.

These powerful stories speak for the many who have no voice and the urgent need for systemic criminal justice reform. This cannot wait. I can think of no one better than my friend @VanJones68 to lead this @reform. https://t.co/lIrfrr0GfQ,2019-01-28 17:14:18,Twitter Web App,80,361

Another heartbreaking example of the bitter fruit of hate religious bigotry and discrimination. A Roman Catholic church in the Philippines was targeted and bombed yesterday killing 20 and wounding dozens. https://t.co/ddhPztWJeG,2019-01-27 23:53:42,Twitter for iPhone,281,1100
Hatred religious intolerance and anti-Semitism are on the rise in the US &amp; around the world.

We’ve seen how destructive religious bigotry is right here in America. Whether Hindu Muslim Buddhist Christian atheist—whatever path people have chosen—every one of us must stand up &amp; condemn those who foment bigotry based on religion race or gender. https://t.co/SeZfDkZQvh,2019-01-27 10:01:30,Twitter for iPhone,429,1593
Our country was established on the basis of freedom of religion — a freedom enshrined in our Constitution that many heroes have given their lives to defend. Nothing is more important to our democracy than freedom. @RNS https://t.co/CBy7lsuRnZ,2019-01-27 04:12:44,Twitter for iPhone,454,1670

No one should be surprised by this. Repealing #NetNeutrality was just another handout to big corporations &amp; telecom giants. Access to high-speed Internet should be available for all Americans– not just those with the $$ to purchase special access rights. https://t.co/XJwTs7PDfp,2019-01-25 22:01:02,Sprout Social,720,1744

The President's first and most important job is keeping the American people safe. President Trump stop putting politics before the wellbeing of the people and our country.

So out of touch. Wilbur Ross &amp; Donald Trump live in the world of the 1/10th of the 1% &amp; have no idea what the real world is like what it's like to live paycheck-to-paycheck the extreme hardships over 800000 federal employees &amp; their families are facing. #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/DAs6d6bQGv,2019-01-25 16:32:51,Twitter Web App,280,1168

Trump threatening Cohen for testifying is the behavior of a mob boss or a petty tyrant in a third world country. It is not the behavior we expect from the president of the United States of America. https://t.co/xB1dDT6pWu,2019-01-24 17:05:08,Sprout Social,288,1146

Allowing the trans military ban to go into effect dishonors the thousands of trans Americans who currently serve in our military.

Our federal employees &amp; their families have now gone a month without a paycheck. Instead of trying to get a win for themselves our leaders need to be working to get a win for the people. End the shutdown now. #PeopleBeforeParty #ServiceAboveSelf,2019-01-22 20:13:03,Sprout Social,517,2121

2018 was the hottest year on record for our planet’s oceans. Study: “The vast majority of global warming heat ends up deposited in the world’s oceans."
