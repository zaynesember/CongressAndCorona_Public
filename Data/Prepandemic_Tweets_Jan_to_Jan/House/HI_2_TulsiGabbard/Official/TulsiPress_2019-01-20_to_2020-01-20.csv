Hoʻomaikaʻi to Hiro Toiya new director of @Oahu_DEM. Keeping people safe during disasters + emergencies is one of government’s most important kuleana.

It’s a slap in the face to use veterans &amp; their families as political pawns. Our bipartisan legislation will ensure that Gold Star families won’t have to worry about whether or not they'll be able to afford to pay the rent or put food on the table in the event of a govt shutdown,2019-01-30 16:37:25,Twitter Web Client,33,172

This is not about politics. It's about equality. It's about humanity. It's long overdue that we pass the Equal Rights Amendment and include equality between men and women in the United States Constitution. #ERANow,2019-01-29 17:47:46,Twitter Web Client,25,146

In 1923 the ERA was introduced to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex and was reintroduced every session until it finally passed in 1972.
