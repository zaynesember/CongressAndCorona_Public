Last night I voted to require background checks for all gun sales in the US.  The bill passed and will soon receive a final vote before the House of Representatives.  This is the first time in nearly a decade that we are moving forward on real reform. We are keeping our promise.,2019-02-14 17:03:21,Twitter Web Client,30,201

If you are referring to the Trail of Tears the forced relocation of Native Americans that more than 4000 people died during this is a disgusting continuation of hate. https://t.co/5vJMuvJsaE,2019-02-10 20:32:51,Twitter for iPhone,159,606

When we give millions of dollars to law enforcement and to prisons to solve the problem of gun violence we need to include far more dollars for community-based solutions that are run by the people who actually live in those communities.

The #SOTU was a clear example of the fact that after 2 years on the job Trump doesn't understand that Congress is a coequal branch of government and that one of our responsibilities is oversight.   It was a juvenile response to serious investigations. https://t.co/B12tQx239j,2019-02-07 18:26:36,Twitter Web Client,24,73
We’re working on a robust proactive and positive agenda that we’re going to fight for over these next few years.   As for these investigations? He’s going to see very quickly that we can walk and chew gum at the same time.   https://t.co/5LWySwnHrS,2019-02-07 01:58:30,Twitter for iPhone,45,191
Words in last night’s #SOTU: more than 5000  Words about guns: 0  The House Judiciary Committee is holding an entire HEARING on gun violence right now for the first time in years.

One part where Trump was right tonight:   There are more than 100 women in Congress now and he can take a bit of credit for that...  #StateoftheUnion2019,2019-02-06 02:54:11,Twitter for iPhone,142,811

By staying in office and continuing this pain Governor Northam is showing that he really doesn’t understand the severity of what he did.   https://t.co/9VvaIz8nrU,2019-02-05 04:21:18,Twitter for iPhone,37,217
The idea that we did not have problems in the 2018 election and that all the testimony was just an exaggeration is an embarrassment.   The former members of the White House’s voter suppression committee that testified last week should be ashamed of themselves. https://t.co/F5dUAkppZS,2019-02-05 01:11:55,Twitter Web Client,40,136
Some children may never see their parents again — and then what? Will they languish in foster care become too old for foster care and then be forgotten?   The Trump administration MUST find and reunite these families. https://t.co/U1hjTszYft,2019-02-04 20:47:03,Twitter Web Client,84,173

What we’re learning from last night’s filing is what we’d suspected all along: the Trump administration has NO IDEA how many kids they separated and they have NO IDEA where they are.  https://t.co/ta0Wb0oplo,2019-02-03 05:10:27,Twitter for iPhone,251,341

There was a Honduran mother that was reunited with her child THIS WEEK after being separated at our border. The mother was told that she would have to pay $4000 to see her kid.

Using your governmental authority to purge more than 100000 people from voter rolls during an election that you're running in is NOT called reasonable list maintenance. That's called voter suppression. https://t.co/3o6O5wQGOs,2019-01-29 20:39:19,Twitter Web Client,1414,3446

The thing that’s the most ironic about this shutdown is that Trump says the reason for it is border security.   We have people at the border who aren’t being paid. We have TSA agents who aren’t getting paid.   These are the very people that are supposed to keep us safe. https://t.co/fj3YsGzD8s,2019-01-24 14:43:10,Twitter Web Client,77,294
