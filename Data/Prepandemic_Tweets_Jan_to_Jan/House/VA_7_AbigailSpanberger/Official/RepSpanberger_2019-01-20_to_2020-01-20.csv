Yesterday I presented the Congressional Medal Award to two #VA07 cousins Anneliese and Nicolas. Congratulations to you both! It was wonderful to celebrate this achievement with your families. Your ability to set goals see them through and serve others will take you far. https://t.co/7Fg1uJnBM5,2020-01-19 17:55:23,Twitter for iPhone,8,44
Help us show #VA07's appreciation and gratitude for our veterans! Now through Feb. 7 you can mail or drop off a card at one of our district offices. On Valentine's Day we'll deliver them to veterans and caregivers across Central Virginia! https://t.co/L4VinrPwBN,2020-01-19 15:00:00,TweetDeck,7,22
The men &amp; women who have selflessly defended our nation deserve our highest level of respect &amp; appreciation. Valentines for Veterans is one small way to show #VA07's gratitude! I hope many of you will find time to send a card for a veteran to our district offices. Details👇 https://t.co/9L7Zrl914F,2020-01-17 18:19:00,Twitter Web App,13,24
I'm proud to work on this effort with my constituent Mike a veteran military firefighter from Powhatan who represents the best of #VA07. His service overseas and persistent advocacy at home has truly made a difference for his fellow veterans in Central Virginia. https://t.co/f7e7Bpxlcb,2020-01-17 16:17:26,Twitter Web App,7,49
Military firefighters risk their lives each day to save our servicemembers. This high-risk work often exposes them to toxic carcinogens. This week I introduced a bill that would help veteran military firefighters get the care they've earned. https://t.co/sCfi1liouR,2020-01-17 16:16:53,Twitter Web App,12,25
“At a time of divisive angry partisanship the call to do right by our service members their families and the Constitution is one that can and should unite us.” I’m proud to work together with both Democratic and Republican colleagues on this vital issue. https://t.co/NHnGofGGX1,2020-01-16 22:40:24,Twitter for iPhone,18,56
“Too often military families experience multiple deployments while the rest of us including members of Congress go about our lives disconnected from their sacrifice. Our broken system is failing them.” https://t.co/UMwjQineAS,2020-01-16 22:32:43,Twitter for iPhone,8,26
Today I introduced the Michael Lecik Military Firefighters Protection Act. Rooted in the advocacy of a Powhatan #VA07 veteran this bill would enable veteran military firefighters to be treated at VA facilities for diseases tied to their high-risk work. https://t.co/U2fn84Sc6h,2020-01-16 18:16:07,Twitter Web App,9,44
I'm extremely proud to introduce this bipartisan bill in Mike's name and take another step toward securing the health benefits that veteran military firefighters have earned. Thank you to @RepDonBacon for joining me on this important bipartisan effort.,2020-01-16 18:15:28,Twitter Web App,4,33
After bringing the issue to my attention Mike and I worked together to craft the Michael Lecik Military Firefighters Protection Act. This bipartisan bill would provide veterans firefighters with the healthcare &amp; retirement benefits they've earned through service.,2020-01-16 18:15:28,Twitter Web App,3,25
After his diagnosis Mike found that the VA doesn't recognize the link between military firefighting &amp; certain diseases like cancer. This makes it very hard for veteran firefighters to get the treatment they need. Mike became a fierce advocate on this issue.,2020-01-16 18:15:28,Twitter Web App,1,12
Military firefighters are exposed to unique dangers during their work including intense exposure to burning carcinogens. After his service to our country ended Mike was diagnosed with multiple myeloma - a type of cancer linked to his time in our armed forces.,2020-01-16 18:15:27,Twitter Web App,2,15
Mike lives in Powhatan #VA07 and like me he's the proud parent of three girls. Mike served our nation as a military firefighter deploying twice to the Middle East. He worked to defend &amp; rescue our troops in truly harrowing high-risk circumstances. https://t.co/YuQAx59vmE,2020-01-16 18:15:26,Twitter Web App,9,72
During today's @HouseForeign hearing on Afghanistan I asked about the enormous cost of this 19-year-long conflict to American taxpayers. Moving forward we have a responsibility to ensure that we don't repeat the same mistakes that led to extensive waste and abuse of funds. https://t.co/Zj2Zee7lt9,2020-01-16 00:07:49,Twitter Web App,33,102
I thank my fellow Virginian @BobbyScott for his leadership on this legislation and I look forward to working on additional bipartisan solutions that protect &amp; support #VA07 workers and expand opportunity for all Americans.,2020-01-15 22:28:46,Twitter Web App,3,14
Today I voted to pass the bipartisan Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act to help protect Virginians against workplace discrimination. This commonsense measure would simply reestablish prior standards to protect workers. https://t.co/kIxG78o2zv,2020-01-15 22:28:23,Twitter Web App,5,20
In the wake of the Great Recession many older Americans were forced to continue working longer and retire later than previous generations. Now we’re seeing rising rates of workplace discrimination against this hardworking group. https://t.co/TOf7SR3ZwI,2020-01-15 22:27:46,Twitter Web App,14,34
I’m hopeful that this deal can be the first step in reopening Chinese markets. However most tariffs remain in effect - even after this agreement. The administration must not call this a done deal or pause its efforts to end the reckless trade war. https://t.co/jsVIQzOrQ0,2020-01-15 20:19:46,Twitter Web App,6,18
As many Americans celebrate today we also thank the advocates in the Commonwealth &amp; across the United States who have worked tirelessly to bring today's #ERA vote to fruition.

We will certainly remember this day in history. As a mom daughter sister proud Virginian and fierce believer in the power &amp; promise of our constitution I'm proud to see the #ERA pass both the @VaHouse and @VASenate today. https://t.co/LG03jyehQf,2020-01-15 19:42:13,Twitter Web App,43,215
I will return to this issue over the coming months because I believe it’s vitally important to have a strong clear on-the-record decision-making process when we’re considering sending American lives into harm’s way.,2020-01-14 21:19:34,Twitter Web App,7,26
Specifically I’m concerned about how the authorizations of military force passed in 2001 and 2002 have been manipulated and stretched to allow for military actions that Congress never imagined and which might be very far from the original intent of the law.,2020-01-14 21:19:34,Twitter Web App,6,23
During my time in the hearing I focused on an issue that is much bigger than any individual incident or administration - the role of Congress in the authorization of war.,2020-01-14 21:19:34,Twitter Web App,5,18
Today @HouseForeign held a hearing to learn more about the administration's Iran strategy. Given the impact this strategy can have on U.S. servicemembers I was disappointed that Secretary Pompeo couldn't attend. I look forward to hearing him speak on this before Congress soon.,2020-01-14 21:19:33,Twitter Web App,25,62
I'm encouraged to see this recent news from the @EPA.

Hundreds of #VA07 constituents have expressed concerns to me about the harmful impacts of #PFAS chemicals. Virginians have rightfully asked for Congress to take steps to lower the existing health risks to their families and their communities and today we took action.,2020-01-10 17:18:26,Twitter Web App,7,19
Today’s vote on the War Powers Resolution doesn't change that and it's not enough. It's merely a first step. In Congress we must fight tooth &amp; nail to keep the authorization of war - our most solemn responsibility - from the clutches of partisan hackery. https://t.co/VIWZVofMm3,2020-01-09 23:48:16,Twitter Web App,10,62
The truth is that Republican and Democratic administrations alike have been abusing authorizations of military force for 20 years. Some Members of Congress have stood silent when their own party’s president stretched AUMFs to wage war a continent away from the original target.,2020-01-09 23:48:16,Twitter Web App,7,59
I voted tonight to affirm that the Executive can engage our armed forces to defend against imminent attack.

One of the first steps we must take in lowering prescription drug prices is to demand transparency from all the players in the prescription drug supply chain.

One reason I'm focused on expanding reliable broadband access for rural communities in #VA07 is healthcare.

The U.S. Senate's inaction has permanent consequences for American families. Today once again I wrote to @senatemajldr urging him to allow a vote on H.R. 8 a bipartisan gun violence prevention bill that passed the House with support from both Republicans and Democrats. https://t.co/Wk6rjqjDO8,2019-11-21 16:06:33,Twitter Web App,18,41
This year there have been more than 370 incidents where four or more Americans were shot or killed.

In 2018 alone Virginia exported $4.3 billion dollars of goods to Canada &amp; Mexico. They are two of our largest trading partners.

I've heard firsthand from #VA07 business leaders about how the #USMCA could strengthen export opportunities &amp; spur economic growth in the area.

I'm running out of ways to describe this cycle of Congress moving from one almost-crisis to another.

If we aren’t actively protecting against threats from foreign technology companies like #Huawei we're putting American families businesses and data at risk.

BILL UPDATE 📢 Today my bipartisan #Secure5G bill passed out of @EnergyCommerce during a markup session.

Farmers face intense stress every day and the rural suicide rate has grown to be 45% higher than in urban areas.

My heart goes out to the victims in #Fresno &amp; their loved ones.

Native Americans are the U.S.'s most rural population – they also suffer high rates of poverty &amp; unemployment.

This tragedy comes more than 7 months after Republicans &amp; Democrats in the House came together to pass a gun violence prevention bill.

My heart is with the Santa Clarita victims &amp; their families as well as those recovering from injuries. I also thank law enforcement officers for their swift response.

For at least the seventh time this year Americans across the country are devastated to learn that children have been injured and killed in a school shooting. The regularity of these tragedies is appalling. (1/3),2019-11-14 21:06:08,Twitter Web App,13,64
Four year colleges aren't the right choice for every student but financial aid options for short-term #CTE programs are scant.

My #PBM bill passed the House without a single vote against it because this is a priority for all Americans - Republicans &amp; Democrats.

I spoke on the House floor tonight because the U.S. must use all available resources to secure his release. We believe Austin Tice is alive and being held by the Syrian government. We must use every diplomatic tool in our toolbox to #FreeAustinTice. https://t.co/d02yB9c9hI,2019-11-13 01:51:59,Twitter Web App,17,39
Tice was taken captive at a Syrian checkpoint while reporting on the consequences that the devastating war is having on Syrian youth. As a journalist he appreciated the vital role of the free press and as a former U.S. Marine he always sought to serve others. #FreeAustinTice,2019-11-13 01:51:58,Twitter Web App,5,27
My meeting with Marc Tice was the kind of experience you don’t soon forget. He exuded strength &amp; devotion even in the face of an unimaginable struggle. His son Austin Tice has been in captivity in Syria for more than 7 years – 2647 days.   It's beyond time to bring him home.,2019-11-13 01:51:58,Twitter Web App,19,55
Today I urged the administration to use all available resources to secure the release of Austin Tice. A freelance journalist &amp; former Marine he was detained at a Syrian checkpoint in 2012.

#VA07 is home to a strong vibrant Sikh community. As many of our neighbors celebrate the 550th anniversary of Guru Nanak's birth today I wish you peace and prosperity. #Gurpurab550,2019-11-12 17:49:15,Twitter Web App,20,100
I've heard from #VA07 employers who are facing a shortage of skilled job applicants and I've also seen the excellent work being done at our district's #CTE programs. The JOBS Act would help bridge this gap creating more paths from post-secondary education to stable careers. https://t.co/Uf0vvSMgMg,2019-11-12 16:03:48,Twitter Web App,2,12
The bipartisan JOBS Act would extend Pell Grant eligibility to include short-term #CTE programs. This practical step would help more students obtain the education they need to fill job openings in areas where employers find trouble filling vacancies. https://t.co/0ZPWl3gMe2,2019-11-12 16:03:46,Twitter Web App,8,19

The President's decision to leave the Paris Accord is a mistake. If we’re not at the negotiating table we won’t have any say in how the Accord is enforced.

Collin Peterson for working across the aisle to support these practical reforms that are vital for rural communities in #VA07 and across the country.,2019-11-04 18:25:52,Twitter Web App,1,12
Agribusinesses &amp; farms told us what they need to succeed and our bipartisan group of House colleagues listened. By making practical fixes to the outdated H-2A system we can help farmers hire the workers they need and create a way for ag workers to earn legal status.,2019-11-04 18:25:52,Twitter Web App,1,11
This strongly bipartisan bill would ✅Help #VA07 farms &amp; greenhouses stay in operation during busy seasons  ✅Simplify the H-2A process &amp; establish a year-round visa program  ✅Create a merit-based program for workers to earn legal status through continued employment,2019-11-04 18:25:52,Twitter Web App,2,9
The Farm Workforce Modernization Act would help meet rural #VA07's need for steady access to qualified legal labor &amp; make the H-2A guest worker program fairer for agribusiness &amp; workers. I'm proud to introduce this bill with 23 Democrats &amp; 21 Republicans. https://t.co/c2JpSFNJ8J,2019-11-04 18:25:52,Twitter Web App,8,27

I've received lots of questions recently from #VA07 about the #USMCA so I wanted to give a quick update! Because the White House is still negotiating the agreement the full House hasn't seen the final text yet. Once we do we will be able to take a vote.,2019-11-01 14:14:38,Twitter Web App,9,45

Since coming to the House I’ve stressed the urgent need to responsibly tackle our national debt &amp; build a pathway toward a balanced budget. I’ll keep working with my colleagues to make sure #VA07’s trick-or-treaters aren’t saddled with a ghastly debt burden when they are older. https://t.co/jMn2PuJQLv,2019-10-31 18:38:59,Twitter Web App,13,42

#ICYMI Last night the House passed my #PBM prescription drug bill by an overwhelming majority. I'll keep working until this bipartisan bill supported by 403 House members gets a vote in the Senate. #VA07 constituents can't afford to wait for lower prescription drug prices. https://t.co/qdoQo5oq6g,2019-10-29 13:15:00,TweetDeck,51,230
#VA07 I have exciting news! At our prescription drug roundtable &amp; town halls many of you told me your concerns about the murky role that #PBMs play in driving up prescription drug costs. Tonight I did something about it: getting a #PBM bill passed in the House by 403 to 0. https://t.co/UrfSJENx8s,2019-10-29 00:13:48,Twitter Web App,69,337
My constituents in #VA07 deserve to know what's going on behind closed doors to drive up their prescription drug costs. My bill works to shed light on the role that #PBMs play in these negotiations. Transparency is Step One in fighting the prescription drug affordability crisis.,2019-10-28 23:44:43,Twitter Web App,3,24
My bill the Public Disclosure of Drug Discounts Act would require #PBMs to publicly disclose the discounts and rebates they receive from drug companies so pharmacists insurers &amp; patients can see for themselves how prescription drug prices are being inflated.,2019-10-28 23:44:42,Twitter Web App,8,24
No one in my district of #VA07 – or anywhere else in the country – should be forced to silently accept the undisclosed results of #PBM negotiations that could be bankrupting them and having permanent consequences for their health and their families. https://t.co/cZGMhjEMBy,2019-10-28 23:44:42,Twitter Web App,4,13
During my prescription drug roundtable in #VA07 I heard firsthand from Virginians concerned about the power of #PBMs. One local pharmacist described how PBMs continue to enjoy record profits while patients &amp; pharmacists get stuck with unsustainable costs. https://t.co/eNH3w51VWc,2019-10-28 23:44:41,Twitter Web App,2,7
Despite their size and power #PBMs largely remain a mystery. Effectively they’re a black box in the long supply chain from pharmaceutical companies to patients. There's little accountability or transparency into the rebates and discounts PBMs receive from drug companies.,2019-10-28 23:44:41,Twitter Web App,3,10
In addition to the huge amount of control they have over the prescription drug market #PBMs take in enormous profits. In 2016 PBMs saw an estimated $22.6 billion in profit. In 2017 alone Express Scripts – America’s largest PBM – raked in more than $4 billion in profits.,2019-10-28 23:44:41,Twitter Web App,2,9
Pharmacy benefit managers or #PBMs are essentially middlemen in the prescription drug supply chain. The 3 biggest PBMs in the country are Express Scripts CVS Caremark and Optum Rx – and they control almost 3/4 of the ENTIRE American prescription drug supply chain.,2019-10-28 23:44:40,Twitter Web App,1,6
I'm proud to see my bill the Public Disclosure of Drug Discounts Act pass the House tonight with overwhelming support from both Republicans and Democrats – a vote of 403 to 0!

PASSED! The House just passed my bill the Public Disclosure of Drug Discounts Act by 403 TO 0! My bill will shed light on the deals #PBMs make with drug companies and start to address one of the root causes of our prescription drug affordability crisis. https://t.co/cZGMhjEMBy,2019-10-28 23:30:22,Twitter Web App,146,647

Earlier this year a bipartisan majority of the House passed commonsense background check legislation as well as a bill to close loopholes in our system.   However the Senate has failed to do its job—and these bills haven’t come up for a single vote on the Senate floor. (3/4),2019-08-04 21:45:49,Twitter for iPhone,16,45
These reforms should include applying the same background check standard to all purchases and closing longstanding internet and gun show loopholes.   But right now Congress is failing the American people. (2/4),2019-08-04 21:45:49,Twitter for iPhone,9,16
The mass shootings in #ElPaso and #Dayton are nothing short of heartbreaking. As we continue to witness senseless gun violence in our stores offices schools and places of worship we’re long overdue for concrete changes that can promote stronger gun safety.

This move is a step in the right direction and I’m encouraged by the decision to fix our inaccurate coverage maps.  But rural areas need more than a press release—they need results.

The agents who found them too late to save their lives set up signs to keep it from happening again.    I'll never forget the image of those signs or the story of this tragic loss of life. https://t.co/5nwSKSwhnA,2019-08-01 01:07:07,Twitter Web App,2,7
The agent described his fellow agents carrying these bodies from the brush — the woman and her three children. After a treacherous journey through Central America a woman and her children died in the place where they sought safety and opportunity. https://t.co/F6lhUqJkK6,2019-08-01 01:06:29,Twitter Web App,16,27
During my trip to the border earlier this month I saw signs in the grass that said “follow the arrows to receive help” in Spanish. A Border Patrol agent explained that they'd made the signs after a woman &amp; her three young children had died while walking through the thick brush. https://t.co/Otb4xvJaNJ,2019-08-01 01:04:53,Twitter Web App,13,36

Nearly 1/2 of all calls placed to cell phones this year will be scam calls. This week I voted Yes to pass the #StopBadRobocalls Act.

I'm appalled by the White House's veto of these resolutions including my measure to block the sale of offensive weapons to Saudi Arabia.

While we should always safeguard the full faith &amp; credit of the United States we must also work in a bipartisan way to pursue a clean debt ceiling bill address the disparity between our revenues &amp; spending as a proportion of our GDP &amp; build a pathway toward a balanced budget.,2019-07-26 14:47:50,Twitter Web App,4,17
One of the responsibilities I take most seriously as a member of Congress is getting our financial house in order. Our children in #VA07 will have to repay this debt one day. That’s not only unjust – it’s crippling to their future economic prospects &amp; weakens our nation.,2019-07-26 14:47:50,Twitter Web App,6,24
This bill would add about $1.5 to $2 trillion to our national debt over the next decade. There are many reasons our debt and deficit continue to climb – including the misguided 2017 tax bill – but until someone says “enough is enough” we will be no closer to a solution.,2019-07-26 14:47:49,Twitter Web App,4,12
Yesterday the House voted on budget legislation. I voted against this bill – H.R. 3877 – and I wanted to take a moment to give you some more background on my decision. 👇,2019-07-26 14:47:49,Twitter Web App,6,21
Today I met with a precocious constituent from Henrico. We explored my office &amp; chatted with my colleague @RepLoisFrankel.

The #ButchLewisAct is crucial to workers &amp; retirees across our district. Yesterday I helped pass the bill &amp; spoke with Tim &amp; his colleagues from Virginia NUCPP. One-on-one conversations like these are invaluable to me when I'm considering different legislative paths. https://t.co/ZBY6ZepJRn,2019-07-25 15:14:55,Twitter for iPhone,2,7
The #ButchLewisAct is about standing with #VA07's truck drivers manufacturers electrical workers contractors &amp; workers in dozens of other industries. I'm proud to help pass this bill for Central Virginia workers and I urge the Senate to act now and bring it to a vote.,2019-07-25 13:30:38,Twitter Web App,0,3
I cosponsored &amp; helped pass the #ButchLewisAct because the bill would ✔️Stabilize these endangered multiemployer plans ✔️Prevent harsh cuts to benefits that could impact the financial stability of millions of American workers seniors and their families in #VA07 and beyond,2019-07-25 13:30:38,Twitter Web App,1,3

There are about 1400 multiemployer pension plans covering about 10 million workers &amp; seniors across the U.S. (including many in #VA07). Many of these plans are now facing collapse &amp; millions of retirees workers and families would lose benefits through no fault of their own...,2019-07-25 13:30:38,Twitter Web App,0,1
Central Virginians who work hard for decades play by the rules and save responsibly for their retirement should never be unfairly punished for mismanagement of their pensions. Here’s some more information about the #ButchLewisAct: https://t.co/ap7tjaX5C5,2019-07-25 13:28:44,Twitter Web App,3,15

Avg. net cash farm income is just $24791. That’s below the federal poverty line for a family of four. Farmers in #VA07 are dealing with plummeting profits &amp; market uncertainty.

Broadband access for #rural communities is about connecting ALL Americans to the 21st century infrastructure they need to succeed.

Flawed data collection methods lead to overestimation of access in #rural areas of #VA07.

I’m proud to help pass this important legislation because I trust the nonpolitical assessment of our military &amp; intelligence experts – #ClimateChange threatens our national security. https://t.co/5njHjdRQ7R,2019-05-02 16:23:33,Twitter Web Client,13,61

Effects of #ClimateChange hinder our military’s ability to respond effectively to threats around the globe. The Pentagon began seriously addressing this issue 15+ years ago but recent actions by the administration haven’t reflected this concern by military experts. 🌎,2019-05-01 19:28:46,Twitter Web Client,4,31
I helped introduce the #ClimateActionNow Act because nonpartisan military &amp; intelligence experts agree: #ClimateChange needs to be taken seriously as a national security threat-multiplier especially in unstable areas of Sub-Saharan Africa the Middle East &amp; Southeast Asia. https://t.co/vc5qoOFqOE,2019-05-01 19:28:11,Twitter Media Studio,22,109

Example: often if just one house in a census tract has high-speed access the FCC will count every house in the area as having access.

Illuminating meeting with @Mission_Ready. Having a large number of healthy educated and diverse young adults is crucial not only for an effective military but for a thriving workforce.

Last week I was proud to help pass the #PaycheckFairnessAct. On #EqualPayDay I urge the Senate to consider this bill that would help support working families &amp; give women tangible tools to stand up against systemic discrimination. https://t.co/4ET5RkGvwR,2019-04-02 18:34:00,TweetDeck,21,62
#EqualPay is one of the clearest ways we can support working families in #VA07. On average Virginia women make just 78 cents for every $1 a man makes doing the same job. That gap makes it harder for working families to cover rent medical bills &amp; childcare costs. #EqualPayDay,2019-04-02 18:00:00,TweetDeck,18,56
Withdrawing from international #ClimateChange agreements doesn’t eliminate the problem – it just leaves a vacuum for other nations like Russia &amp; China to take our place.

Today my daughter Charlotte sat in on the @houseforeign hearing on national security &amp; #ClimateChange. During her lifetime climate change could destabilize fragile states around the globe.

This week I’ll be voting in support of a full #VAWA reauthorization because we must reaffirm that all women should be protected from violence.

We can narrow the rural-urban health gap by strengthening federal investment in rural health programs protecting Medicare and Medicaid and investing in infrastructure that improves #rural residents’ access to healthcare providers. #VA07 #NPHW,2019-04-02 14:16:00,TweetDeck,5,16
Today for #NPHW I want to draw attention to the unique public health challenges facing #rural communities in #VA07. Rural Americans are more likely to live below the poverty line face shortages of health professionals &amp; lack access to health facilities.

Constitutionally it is Congress that has the authority to appropriate money and the President’s efforts to sidestep that authority and the checks and balances process that authority represents is deeply concerning. (4/4),2019-02-15 18:48:24,Twitter Web Client,12,119

17- We must demonstrate a willingness to collaborate and compromise as we serve the people we were elected to represent.,2019-02-06 04:00:43,Twitter Web Client,10,43
16- We are indeed stronger as a country when Congress and the President work together to move us forward and our challenges are simply too large to sit idle in our corners.,2019-02-06 04:00:28,Twitter Web Client,6,28
15- This commitment to bipartisan engagement includes pushing to prevent another senseless government shutdown. I support discussions about strengthening our security but we can do so without shuttering the government and subjecting the federal workforce to additional pain.,2019-02-06 04:00:16,Twitter Web Client,6,20

3- Instead it has fostered distrust in our system of government—and the record-long government shutdown was a testament to Washington’s ineptitude. The people of #VA07 just want us to do our jobs.,2019-02-06 03:57:55,Twitter Web Client,5,34
2- For Central Virginians this brand of politics has not contributed in any meaningful way to lowering healthcare costs increasing economic opportunity or supporting the next generation of workers.,2019-02-06 03:57:42,Twitter Web Client,5,33
