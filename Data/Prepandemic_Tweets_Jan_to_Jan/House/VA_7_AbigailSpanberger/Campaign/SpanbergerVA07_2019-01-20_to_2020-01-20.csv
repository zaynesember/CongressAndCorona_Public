This is the problem facing politics today- arrogant ignorance.

This resolution passed with bipartisan support in the House &amp; Senate. Republicans &amp; Democrats alike agreed that keeping us engaged in a Saudi-led war as civilians die &amp; starve is not the path we should continue.

In response to comments:  Criminal gangs are a threat to our security.  Terrorists are a violent scourge upon humanity.  &amp; WE are a nation of laws.

Assigning subhuman characteristics to the “other” has led to atrocities world wide. This is shameful.   Human beings are human beings.

When voters wonder what’s wrong with Washington-&gt; this is it.   If our campaign finance reform &amp; anti-corruption bill doesn't have enough votes in the Senate to pass let’s see it.

Sen. McConnell won’t even let the Senate vote on the anti-corruption &amp; campaign finance reform package we passed.    Is he afraid it would pass the Senate?
