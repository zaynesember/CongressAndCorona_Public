ICYMI - Yesterday’s @HoustonChron covered some of the highlights of my first year in Congress.

Why he came to Texas is rather obvious. Why he thinks that calling hurting Texans some kind of hurricane profiteers is a winning message is a mystery. But it is not a surprise. It is a sign of his lack of empathy of understanding &amp; of interest.,2019-10-18 19:53:22,Twitter Web Client,4,24

President Trump came to Texas last night for a rally.  And true to form he insulted us again this time claiming inexplicably that we “made a fortune" on hurricane #Harvey.  https://t.co/YJ4ueLES1G,2019-10-18 19:53:22,Twitter Web Client,12,29
