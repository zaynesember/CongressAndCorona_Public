Now it's the Senate's job to take up this bill so we can open the government and address smart border security &amp; immigration solutions. We cannot shut down the government in order to govern. #EndtheShutdown,2019-01-22 18:27:28,TweetDeck,20,76
It was wonderful to participate in today’s parade in honor of Dr. King as Houstonians march in unity and hope. And it is a particular joy to follow Grand Marshall @RepJohnLewis who inspires me every day with his wisdom his courage his commitment &amp; his belief in this country. https://t.co/XzieE2LMri,2019-01-21 18:08:38,Twitter for iPhone,7,45
There is much work to be done.  And we can do it together.  As Dr. King said “the time is always right to do what is right.”,2019-01-21 14:39:03,Twitter for iPhone,8,22
Today we remember &amp; honor Dr. Martin Luther King for his belief in an America as good as its promise for all Americans and his courage to make it so. As we reflect on his life we have the opportunity to reflect on what we can do right now to ensure equality &amp; justice for all.,2019-01-21 14:38:44,Twitter for iPhone,11,45
Loved welcoming my first @CloseUp_DC group from #TX07’s Episcopal High School. It brought back memories of my own Close Up trip back in 1991 when I visited my then Congressman who represented what is now part of #TX07. https://t.co/feuUrc9bd8,2019-01-20 19:34:00,TweetDeck,6,43
This is my first year to watch #houmarathon from the finish line.  What a sight!  Congratulations to all the runners — those who crossed this finish line and all who took on the challenge.  My hat is off to y’all. @HoustonMarathon. https://t.co/FdjVdl7ENG,2019-01-20 17:44:54,Twitter for iPhone,0,20
When I lived on University Blvd years ago the #HouMarathon course went right past my front door.  Glad to be back on University to cheer on the runners.  Thank you Mayor Sample for inviting me to watch from West U City Hall! https://t.co/IFJkrxv9E4,2019-01-20 14:30:34,Twitter for iPhone,0,18
Each January I look forward to waking up early on this day and heading out to cheer on the #houmarathon runners.  I am so inspired by the diverse group of people of all ages who make the commitment to run these 26.2 miles. @HoustonMarathon https://t.co/2g9IezwUFS,2019-01-20 14:07:22,Twitter for iPhone,1,35
It is time to discuss these matters with the seriousness they deserve. Time to #endtheshutdown and get to work #forthepeople.,2019-01-20 01:00:27,Twitter for iPhone,7,35
Democrats have made clear we support smart effective border security solutions: increased infrastructure investments advanced technology to scan for contraband more customs personnel and more immigration judges.,2019-01-20 01:00:26,Twitter for iPhone,5,32
There is much to discuss on border security matters but this is not the way to do it. We cannot run our government by shutting it down.  And we cannot protect our country by hurting the very people who have made it their life’s work to work for us.,2019-01-20 01:00:26,Twitter for iPhone,3,20
The President’s statement today was truly a disappointment. There was nothing new and no compromise just another attempt to pit people in difficult situations against one another. That’s not a solution.,2019-01-20 01:00:26,Twitter for iPhone,14,72
