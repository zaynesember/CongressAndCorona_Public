Efforts to add a citizenship question were misguided untested and would seriously threaten participation and skew the results of the #Census. We must always stand in the face of efforts to undermine our democracy.,2019-07-02 22:04:51,TweetDeck,2,32
The Trump Administrations efforts to include a citizenship question in the Census was wrong from the beginning.   To protect the pillars of our democracy we must ensure all communities are accurately counted in the 2020 Census. https://t.co/s3YGpE2t7q,2019-07-02 22:04:20,TweetDeck,5,38

Securing our elections should be a bipartisan issue. The Mueller report made it clear – Russia interfered during the 2016 elections.

The #ForthePeople Act (passed by the House in March) takes great steps to return the power of government to the people. HR 1 secures elections reduces the influence of big money in politics and strengthens government ethics laws. https://t.co/CTJvXHfCCu,2019-07-02 21:00:30,Twitter Web Client,2,3
Further I have strong legislation (Safeguarding Election Infrastructure Act) which ensures states have the resources and intelligence necessary to protect voting equipment and safeguard our elections from outside interference. https://t.co/XnmWtKTig0,2019-07-02 21:00:30,Twitter Web Client,0,4

On July 1 1966 Medicare began. John Dingell Sr introduced the first version of Medicare in 1943.
