Whether it's the food we eat or the period products we use we deserve to know exactly what we're putting into our bodies.

.@realDonaldTrump is going to do all he can to prevent a free and fair election in 2020. You and I both know it -- and I'm working with @letamericavote @JasonKander to stop him.  Read my @NYDailyNews op-ed here ⬇️ https://t.co/sdPeyyLrzd,2019-10-10 23:53:00,Sprout Social,70,229
Thanks to Cynthia Leung for talking about the lack of diversity in NY's climate movement. In every movement but especially those that disproportionately impact communities of color &amp; marginalized communities we have to make sure all voices are heard. https://t.co/vwDug5uvVc,2019-10-10 22:51:01,Sprout Social,3,9
When the numbers show that immigrants struggle to obtain healthcare the human response -- the only response -- is to make healthcare more affordable and accessible for all. NOT deny them a green card as punishment. https://t.co/K7KG6HH7Mr,2019-10-10 21:10:25,Twitter Web App,1,7
Flushing Meadows-Corona Park is again celebrating Queens artists with their grant program. Can't wait to visit the park with the kids when the winning artworks are installed! https://t.co/FTxifl1XrP,2019-10-10 20:19:01,Sprout Social,0,6
American working women have struggled with the question of childcare for generations. It's not getting better and it won't get better until @TheDemocrats make it one of our top priorities. It's past time. https://t.co/lJ3CVDsu0m,2019-10-10 19:10:02,Sprout Social,3,9
Oh yes @emmagf I remember these days. Every New York mom has been here and now those moms are going to demand change. I fought for elevators at the Flushing-Main Street LIRR Station and I'll continue to fight for train accessibility for all New Yorkers https://t.co/xabJ83Sy9i,2019-10-10 18:34:29,Twitter Web App,0,7

Again -- @realDonaldTrump is dangerous and we all need to take action to stop him.   For some it's already too late. https://t.co/wHJFRy2Cpi,2019-10-10 01:31:00,Sprout Social,0,14

In the 2012 2014 and 2016 elections unfairly drawn congressional districts shifted an average of 59 House seats. 59.  We're done letting politicians chose their voters. It's time every American has a fair and equal vote. https://t.co/hYizdzfsTy,2019-10-09 00:44:00,Sprout Social,0,5
"Menstrual hygiene is a right not a privilege" 🙌 @nadyaokamoto @periodmovement   And that's why we'll #MarchForSisterhood this Friday. https://t.co/UvfCy5lwEx,2019-10-08 21:10:01,Sprout Social,3,6
The Pennsylvania Menstrual Equity Act is exactly the kind of legislation we need everywhere! I'm proud of my Menstrual Equity for All Act and I'm excited to see states taking their own steps to end #PeriodPoverty in America once and for all! https://t.co/OtXEsNzWCL,2019-10-08 19:28:01,Sprout Social,5,30
The horror stories we're hearing from kids pregnant women and the LGBTQ community make it clear: If detention centers don't have the capacity to provide adequate medical and mental health care the people who need those services shouldn't be held there. https://t.co/Fp8ZVCvLvf,2019-10-08 17:59:01,Sprout Social,4,8
Today #SCOTUS is hearing a case that could impact Kathleen &amp; Casey &amp; millions of Americans like them. It's one of the most important fights for LGBTQ rights yet. We all need to make our voices heard &amp; make it clear that discrimination is unacceptable https://t.co/fvSePP9FGF,2019-10-08 16:50:03,Sprout Social,4,6
New York got it right -- the American people deserve to see @realDonaldTrump's tax returns and we need to know whether he's hiding conflicts of interest now more than ever. https://t.co/Bxa5Z1HGZZ,2019-10-08 00:12:00,Sprout Social,17,55
Longer waits for communities of color  No translation services No non-English ballots  There are too many ways POC are discriminated against at the polls. In 2020 we have to make sure every voice is heard in Queens &amp; across the country @letamericavote https://t.co/eWFeM6jCJm,2019-10-07 23:01:00,Sprout Social,1,9
158 House districts have experienced a mass shooting this year alone. Gun violence hurts all of us and we need every single rep to step up to stop it. If they won't -- @TheDemocrats have a plan to vote them out https://t.co/1vzIouKHbh,2019-10-07 21:25:00,Sprout Social,4,3
When states decided to expand Medicaid under the ACA they saved lives. When they chose not to they put Americans like Patricia Powers at serious risk. More insured Americans are better for us all and it's time for states to get on board. https://t.co/7whvSkon5c,2019-10-07 20:29:00,Sprout Social,0,2

.@realDonaldTrump has been accused of asking foreign governments to help him win re-election -- now he's doing it before our eyes. To the members of the @GOP this isn't partisan. It's time for you to stand with us to protect our democracy. https://t.co/taUH8NiFwv,2019-10-06 21:46:00,Sprout Social,2,7

We knew this was coming. From day 1 the Trump administration and the @GOP have worked to take away our right to choose. But I can promise you this -- Americans aren't going to stand by and let them. We're ready to fight back. https://t.co/dLYwfPb8wK,2019-10-06 20:16:01,Sprout Social,4,8
