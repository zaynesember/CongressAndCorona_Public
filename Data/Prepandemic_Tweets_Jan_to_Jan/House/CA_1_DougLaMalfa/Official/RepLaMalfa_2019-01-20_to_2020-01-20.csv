It's been 28 days since Democrats jammed Articles of Impeachment through the House  Since then @POTUS has: ✅Signed phase 1 of a trade deal with China ✅Killed an Iranian terrorist ✅Modernized NEPA  It's clear who is really working for Americans.,2020-01-15 18:07:23,Twitter Web App,36,106
House Democrats just blocked @GOPLeader's resolution to stand behind Iranian protesters who are protesting a regime that chants 'Death to America.'  These people are fighting for freedom and risking their lives in the process. They need our support.,2020-01-14 21:14:00,Twitter Web App,980,2800

It sure seems @SpeakerPelosi's "path to yes" on the #USMCA has been a long and winding one.  Enough stalling - it's time to hold a vote on the House floor so that we can ratify the #USMCAnow https://t.co/CUoQ43755N,2019-11-22 19:44:55,Twitter Web App,181,348
It appears the bipartisan #USMCA is the latest victim of @SpeakerPelosi &amp; @RepAdamSchiff's impeachment obsession.  Not much productivity left for Congress in 2019 - only more theatrics &amp; hysteria from Dems. It's a shame.

While the House focuses its undivided attention on #impeachment I spoke on the House floor to highlight 1 very important item Congress could be working on instead: the #USMCA.

So let me get this straight. Democrats did some focus testing and decided that "bribery" was a better buzzword than "quid pro quo" regardless of whether or not it actually applies (it doesn't). Now they're sticking with it because it better fits their narrative?  Got it. https://t.co/tm58I0bV4k,2019-11-19 19:39:50,Twitter Web App,219,445

Following this week there are only 2 remaining weeks Congress is scheduled to be in session this year.

The 1st public #impeachment hearings took over the cable airwaves this week &amp; I spoke on the House floor to offer my thoughts on this whole process.

Nearly 40% of the Dems who've been tasked with overseeing the impeachment investigation are already compromised.  They have such a strong vendetta against @POTUS that they voted to impeach @realDonaldTrump long before the call in question even took place.  It's a partisan sham. https://t.co/xMGi5or7MG,2019-11-15 15:02:09,Twitter Web App,258,582
Yesterday on impeachment @RepAOC: "This is about preventing a potentially disastrous outcome from occurring next year."  @RepAlGreen in May: "I'm concerned if we don’t impeach this president he will get re-elected."

Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats chose to open an impeachment inquiry based on information they haven’t seen and a source they do not know. Just last week they wanted to impeach Justice Kavanaugh so this must be their latest ‘impeachment of the week.’,2019-09-25 02:04:03,Twitter for iPhone,10,24

(4/4) The 12% FET limits truck replacement by discouraging truck owners from upgrading their older vehicles which doesn’t help to lower emissions or improve truck safety. We won’t truly see a modern truck fleet in the U.S. until it’s repealed.,2019-06-19 17:22:06,Twitter Web Client,1,5
(3/4) Today it’s a cost-prohibitive barrier for small businesses looking to upgrade outdated trucks to safer cleaner more modern vehicles.

This is an unjustifiable and irresponsible decision by the state that will make California a magnet for illegal immigration and impose higher costs on taxpayers from all across the country.,2019-06-12 15:25:37,Twitter Web Client,1,13
If CA already can’t take care of its own people why would the state even consider prioritizing those here illegally?

This applies to far more than just DACA recipients &amp; gives illegal immigrants pathways that aren’t available to those who come here legally.

The #CampFire was the costliest natural disaster in the world last year &amp; one of the worst wildfires CA has ever seen.
