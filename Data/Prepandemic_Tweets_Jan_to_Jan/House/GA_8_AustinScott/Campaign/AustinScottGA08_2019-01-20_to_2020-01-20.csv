I voted NO on the resolution to strip @realDonaldTrump of a critically necessary power to defend against increasing aggression against us and our partners in the region. He had complete authority to utilize an airstrike against General Soleimani and he made the right call. (4/4),2020-01-10 00:01:21,Twitter for iPhone,13,18
President Obama averaged six kills a week by air strikes according to his own DNI (https://t.co/XoTZDTkjpd). (3/4),2020-01-10 00:01:20,Twitter for iPhone,8,7
The only reason Iran is singled out in this resolution is to take a political jab at President Trump for utilizing an airstrike to take out General Soleimani – a terrorist who was responsible for killing thousands of American and partner troops. (2/4),2020-01-10 00:01:20,Twitter for iPhone,5,5
If we want to have an honest debate about war powers then we should have an honest debate about war powers. Why then did our colleagues on the other side of the aisle single out only Iran in this resolution? Why not Libya? Why not Syria? (1/4),2020-01-10 00:01:19,Twitter for iPhone,13,20
