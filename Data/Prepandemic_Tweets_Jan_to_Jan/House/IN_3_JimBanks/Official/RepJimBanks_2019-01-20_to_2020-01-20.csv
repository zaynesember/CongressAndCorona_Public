Most importantly the bill is an obvious precursor to an Orwellian national firearms registry.   The government would try and track every gun owners’ name and the guns he or she owns.   This contradicts the spirit of the #2A. (3/4),2019-09-17 18:35:56,Twitter Web App,3,12

But South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg obstructed the alternative facility. He proudly vetoed a rezoning decision denying Women’s Care Center their intended site. It forced them to find a new location to open.,2019-09-15 15:35:30,Twitter for iPhone,22,38
This bothered many. Some residents decided to open a pro-life pregnancy center called Women’s Care Center right next to the Whole Women’s Health. The hope was that women would be provided a safe alternative choice to Whole Women’s Health.,2019-09-15 15:35:29,Twitter for iPhone,12,35
But there was a push to keep Whole Women’s Health open. That effort resulted in a federal judge issuing a preliminary injunction allowing it to perform unlicensed abortions.,2019-09-15 15:35:29,Twitter for iPhone,13,30
As such the Indiana Department of Health found Whole Women’s Health unsafe for lacking a “reputable and responsible character.” The State of Indiana denied the abortion facility a license.,2019-09-15 15:35:29,Twitter for iPhone,14,32
South Bend’s Whole Women’s Health replaced the Pavilion and employed some of the same staff as the Women’s Pavilion.

Our fears became justified after the Women’s Pavilion (owned by Dr. Klopfer) was found to have violated the law nine times. For example Dr. Klopfer performed an abortion on a 10 yr old who was raped by her uncle.,2019-09-15 15:35:28,Twitter for iPhone,23,39

We need to determine if this is an isolated incident or if there are other monsters practicing in Indiana right now. We also need to know if he acted alone or if anyone else was aware of Klopfer's crimes.,2019-09-14 18:52:23,Twitter for iPhone,1,6
