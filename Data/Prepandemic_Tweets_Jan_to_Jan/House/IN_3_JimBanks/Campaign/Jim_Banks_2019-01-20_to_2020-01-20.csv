I’m four books into my 2019 reading list but good advice here on how I should alter my reading priorities moving forward from my friend @GlennStanton at @FDRLST https://t.co/gBzbDj9btg,2019-02-18 13:04:22,Twitter for iPhone,0,0
Pretty sure America is not looking for Round 2 of the Obama apology tour on the world stage. https://t.co/5Vq8ymCd6j,2019-02-18 00:02:46,Twitter for iPhone,5,32
Quite a contrast with @VP Pence who used stage at @MunSecConf to assert American leadership and extol the virtues of USA’s return to leader of the free world. Not a good look Joe. https://t.co/5Vq8ymCd6j,2019-02-18 00:01:21,Twitter for iPhone,2,7
Hey @PeteButtigieg there’s nothing embarrassing about fighting for our religious liberties. The only thing that was embarrassing was the false left wing demagoguery. @VP was great Gov. for our state who grew our economy &amp; fought for our values. He’ll be great POTUS one day too. https://t.co/7m3cAYyRjJ,2019-02-14 14:16:49,Twitter for iPhone,13,74
.@GOPLeader showed enormous leadership in dealing with Rep Steve King’s offensive statements in stripping him of his committee assignments. @SpeakerPelosi should do the same and remove @IlhanMN from the House Foreign Affairs Committee.,2019-02-11 23:03:17,Twitter for iPhone,10,16

A @POTUS emergency declaration to build the wall is a colossal statement of congressional brokenness and failure to fulfill its constitutional duties of legislating if it comes to that.,2019-02-04 17:11:59,Twitter for iPhone,1,8
Big #iubb win. Glad I deleted without posting all of those frustrated tweets this week. https://t.co/umSpTks8pj,2019-02-03 01:44:54,Twitter for iPhone,0,34

Meanwhile @realDonaldTrump has delivered results making him most pro-life President of my lifetime. These contrasts will become clearer and clearer the closer we get to Nov. 2020. https://t.co/8vJpbr3mX2,2019-01-31 14:13:25,Twitter for iPhone,2,8

Democrats are already laying groundwork for excuses for 2020 loss as they realize their party has drifted too far left to attracts voters in the middle.  https://t.co/fh967VlMWJ,2019-01-27 19:11:23,Twitter for iPhone,3,6
.@RepLizCheney is kind to give them good advice https://t.co/PCbTsupphn,2019-01-24 18:13:47,Twitter for iPhone,1,7
Not sure how @realDonaldTrump conceding there’s no place like House chamber to give #SOTU does anything but keep story alive how petty @SpeakerPelosi has become in rescinding her invitation &amp; cancelling this important and historic tradition. Win for Trump and reason in my book.,2019-01-24 15:30:38,Twitter for iPhone,0,11
