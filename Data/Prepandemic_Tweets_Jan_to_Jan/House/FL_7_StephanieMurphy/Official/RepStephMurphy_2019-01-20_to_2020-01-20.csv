That’s why I voted in favor of @RepThomasMassie’s effort to rename this bill the “Kick the Can Down the Road Act.” We must work together on a bipartisan basis to put our fiscal house in order. Our country’s future depends on it.,2019-07-25 23:14:16,Twitter for iPhone,1,22
Every dollar we spend to pay interest on our national debt is a dollar we don’t spend to improve schools fix our crumbling infrastructure improve our health care system and secure our county from foreign threats.,2019-07-25 23:14:15,Twitter for iPhone,4,22
One of the greatest threats to our national security is our national debt. Unfortunately the House just passed a deeply flawed fiscally-irresponsible budget deal.

The House just passed a bill I cosponsored to grant Temporary Protected Status or #TPS to Venezuelans. Requiring people who have sought refuge in America to return to a failed state violates our core values as a nation and would undermine our national security interests. https://t.co/XxkzxGLWSc,2019-07-25 22:29:56,Twitter for iPhone,18,30

Robocalls are more than a nuisance. They pose a direct threat to consumers &amp; the American people have had enough with these scams. I’m proud to have helped introduce &amp; pass this bill in the House a great first step to protect Americans from robocall harassment. #StopBadRobocalls https://t.co/rdTOuWcjls,2019-07-25 16:16:13,Twitter Web App,3,48
Passing #TPS is a critical step—but it seeks to treat a symptom of the disease rather than trying to cure the disease itself. For Venezuela to prosper and for the U.S. to protect its national security the Maduro regime must go. #VenezuelaLibre #TPSForVenezuelans,2019-07-24 0:05:28,Twitter Web App,1,9
Venezuela is in absolute crisis and making Venezuelans in the U.S. go home right now is immoral. In some cases it could be a death sentence. Requiring people who have sought refuge in America to return to a failed state violates our core values as a nation. https://t.co/3ZhVhWU1dY,2019-07-24 0:05:27,Twitter Web App,5,17
After the Trump Administration abandoned Venezuelans in their hour of need by denying them refuge through Temporary Protected Status House Republicans just blocked our effort to pass bipartisan legislation that would grant them #TPS. https://t.co/PSW2NJdh63,2019-07-24 0:05:05,Twitter Web App,6,18
American citizens have the right to boycott and boycotts can promote positive change but the #BDS movement is misguided and harmful—and we should say so unequivocally. https://t.co/84AhdchSNG,2019-07-23 23:24:54,Twitter Web App,7,38
Today the House passed a resolution I cosponsored that opposes the global #BDS movement because it makes a just peace harder &amp; moves us away from negotiations that could lead to a two-state solution and greater security in the Middle East. https://t.co/XwNxyFr9Fl,2019-07-23 23:23:08,Twitter Media Studio,32,171

Existe un riesgo claro en la seguridad nacional teniendo a un estado fallido en nuestra región.

Requerir que estas personas regresen a Venezuela en este momento es un error. En ausencia de una acción por parte de la administración de Trump el Congreso debe intervenir y pasar la legislación bipartidista que he copatrocinado para otorgar el TPS a los ciudadanos venezolanos.,2019-07-19 19:51:59,Twitter Web App,2,15

There is a clear national security risk to having a failed state in our region. It is in America’s security interest to support the Venezuelan patriots who are leading the fight to reclaim their country from the regime that is destroying it. #VenezuelaLibre,2019-07-19 19:51:58,Twitter Web App,3,4

I strongly support extending Temporary Protected Status to Venezuelans living in Florida and other U.S. states.
