Nothing in HR1 protects our citizens’ right to vote. In fact provisions in this bill put the very security of our elections at risk. That's why I voted no on the Democrats' thinly veiled attempt to protect their majority https://t.co/VU5tvTvpib,2019-03-08 16:30:51,TweetDeck,3,3
HR 1 completely overrides the state election laws that have secured our elections for over 200 years.
