I am proud we passed my Molalla River Wild and Scenic Rivers Act today to designate a 21-mile stretch of the Molalla River as “recreational” under the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System to preserve the beauty history and ecosystem of the river for generations come. https://t.co/uqB30Ic55c,2019-02-27 00:29:54,Twitter Media Studio,8,88

There is a lot happening on the Willamette River and it is important that stakeholders know how they may be affected as federal agencies begin a re-evaluation of how USACE operations on the Willamette River impact chinook and steelhead populations. https://t.co/w2pRwSYg6M,2019-02-22 23:46:50,Twitter Web Client,1,7

POTUS has gone too far. Our founders gave the Legislative Branch not POTUS the express power to decide how to spend taxpayer $$. The POTUS’s job is to execute the will of Congress &amp; his action today is an infringement on the power delegated under Article 1 of the Constitution.,2019-02-15 21:41:12,Twitter Web Client,5,45
I've visited the US-Mexico border &amp; there is no national emergency. Families &amp; children seeking asylum from brutality in their home countries hold no threat. Yesterday Congress passed an overwhelmingly bipartisan agreement on how to fund security along our southern border.,2019-02-15 21:41:12,Twitter Web Client,5,42
As a result of the testimony and outreach by the students of MSD High School in Parkland and students in my own district I am cosponsoring HR 8 the Bipartisan Background Checks Act to require universal background checks on all firearm sales like we have in Oregon.,2019-02-14 22:18:37,Twitter Web Client,3,38
Parents should be able to take their children to school each day knowing they will come home safely that night. My thoughts today are with the families of the 17 students who did not return home a year ago today.,2019-02-14 22:18:37,Twitter Web Client,2,35
I introduced the Molalla River Wild and Scenic Rivers Act this week to preserve the beauty history &amp; ecosystem of our Molalla River while also providing badly-needed economic benefits to our region through increased tourism &amp; recreational opportunities. https://t.co/9lwYVg8LiG,2019-02-13 18:47:59,TweetDeck,3,13

Held a hearing this week in @EnergyCommerce on strengthening our health care system &amp; the decision in Texas v. US.

Today I visited with @TSA workers @NACTA members at @flypdx who have spent the last 35 days working without pay to keep airports safe and running.

Roughly 9600 federal employees in Oregon are being impacted by the current shutdown. I called on @USDOL to make clear that federal employees deemed “essential” - those working without pay - may be eligible for unemployment insurance. https://t.co/u3NSNbanmL,2019-01-24 18:02:11,TweetDeck,3,13
