Spencer worked 3 jobs to get the money to re-construct his shop. He did all the construction. Spencer took one night off to take his girlfriend to dinner for her birthday. Now Spencer’s parents Julie and Dan do not have a son. They do not have their only child to hold.,2019-01-24 22:17:24,Twitter Web Client,77,198
His release ultimately allowed Reyes to brutally murder Spencer and 3 others during a killing spree. The day Reyes took Spencer’s life was the day that would have been the re-Grand Opening of Spencer’s newly built-out guitar shop.,2019-01-24 22:17:24,Twitter Web Client,81,189
Reyes was deported multiple times and served 63-months in prison. During his sentence Reyes nearly killed another inmate. That should have gotten him more prison time. It didn’t. Why? A judge let him out early.,2019-01-24 22:17:23,Twitter Web Client,293,584

Jared’s story alone should be enough to make us act. Tragically his story is not uncommon. Here are a few more …,2019-01-24 22:17:23,Twitter Web Client,53,206
My constituents and colleagues have heard me tell the story of Jared Vargas a young man from my district with so much going for him whose life was needlessly taken at the hands of an illegal immigrant. https://t.co/Yr6UWKlyZS,2019-01-24 22:17:22,Twitter Web Client,402,745
The reality is that migrants are being abducted and forced into slavery. Little girls are being sold into the sex trade. Dangerous drugs are flowing across our borders and into our homes. Americans and migrants are dying.,2019-01-24 22:17:22,Twitter Web Client,366,754
Never did I ever think that Congress would let what is happening at the border continue. As @BarackObama accurately noted in 2014 there is an “actual humanitarian crisis on the border.” That is fact not an opinion or some fearmongering tactic. https://t.co/t2sTan8nrK,2019-01-24 22:17:21,Twitter Web Client,146,306
Never in my wildest dreams did I think that Democrats would hold American national security and sovereignty hostage for 34 days. Never did I think that we would see adults throw temper tantrums over $5.7 billion in necessary spending out of an over trillion spending package.,2019-01-24 22:17:21,Twitter Web Client,165,359
One of the main things I hate about Washington is that politics consistently gets in the way of policy. We play political theater and pat ourselves on the back in the false name of compassion while Americans suffer and ultimately pay the price.,2019-01-24 22:17:21,Twitter Web Client,270,689
