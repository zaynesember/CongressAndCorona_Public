ICYMI: In March #USCBP agents apprehended 92607 individuals along the border - the highest monthly total since FY2007.

Speaker Pelosi has long said “show me your budget show me your values.” So why haven't Dems delivered a budget?

BUDGET→The Budget Committee is marking up a spending caps bill. This is not a budget.

Agreed. Drafting a budget resolution is our chief responsibility.

America’s sheriffs have called this proposal "dangerous." Taking away resources that allow our agents to do their jobs is detrimental to national security and public safety.
