Just last week I held an #impeachment town hall in #Brooklyn &amp; today as I walk through the building where Ukraine Ambassador Yovanovich just gave public testimony you can see how these #impeachmenthearings have brought a certain buzz and energy to The Hill. #ImpeachmentHearing https://t.co/scmER8XBDj,2019-11-15 16:26:43,Twitter for iPhone,23,73
This is devastating.   Enough is enough. How many of our children do we have to mourn before the GOP takes drastic measures to #EndGunViolence? #SantaClarita https://t.co/PY4PqIPNmA,2019-11-14 18:08:20,Twitter for iPhone,6,20
I've said it then and I'll say it again: #StephenMiller is unfit to serve the American people. 45 surrounds himself with white supremacists because he is one. #MillerMustGo https://t.co/WCXI7h1RDi,2019-11-13 20:44:57,Twitter Web App,57,139
Chatted with @Joseph_Marks_ from @washingtonpost about what Congress can do to move the latest #cybersecurity #5G #tech and #smartcities initiatives forward.  👀 Read what I have to say here: ⬇️ https://t.co/3AhzzsUfYL,2019-11-13 01:25:43,Twitter for iPhone,5,4
My bill--The Affordable Housing &amp; AMI Fairness Act--helps make sure #affordablehousing is a reality for all.   As cities like #Brooklyn grow the ability to afford having a roof over one’s head shouldn't be a luxury only provided to those whose income is considered upper class. https://t.co/zlENSEcOrX,2019-11-12 22:17:24,Twitter Web App,17,32
I am so proud that @HouseDemocrats passed my bill #HR6 the Dream and Promise Act to make sure that the doors of opportunity are open to all who know the U.S. as their home. #HomeIsHere,2019-11-12 21:11:38,Twitter Web App,6,22
The choice is clear - we must keep our promise to Dreamers. Denying their legal rights would be immoral and wrong. Turning our backs on them is against our American values. Their contributions are a part of our everyday lives in communities across this country. #HomeIsHere,2019-11-12 21:08:53,Twitter Web App,10,27
