The President called for a $750 billion top-line even after 23 of 26 Republicans on the Armed Services Committee sent him a letter supporting the $733 billion funding level. Why did he do this? #FY20NDAA.,2019-06-12 20:40:33,Twitter Web Client,1,2
Now we are expecting it to be a contentious issue during the markup. So what changed? Once again the President threw a wrench into an issue with bipartisan support. The President did that here by asking for a higher top-line funding level. #FY20NDAA.,2019-06-12 20:40:32,Twitter Web Client,2,3
It's the sum of every authorization we fund in the entire bill. Right now the top-line funding level is $733 billion--which is exactly what the DOD planned and asked for.
