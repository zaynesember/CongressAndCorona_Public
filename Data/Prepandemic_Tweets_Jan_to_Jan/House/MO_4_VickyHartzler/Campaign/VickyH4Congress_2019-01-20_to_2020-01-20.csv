On December 13th of 1636 the colonial militias were organized into official regiments and the descendants of these regiments are still active to this day.  Thank you to all current and former National Guard members for your service. https://t.co/ENwyXfZaOq,2019-12-13 16:07:09,AgoraPulse Manager,2,2
The #JobsReport is out! Wages are up unemployment is at a 50-year low and 266k new jobs.  Meanwhile Nancy Pelosi and House Democrats want to undo Missourians' decision to elect and support @realDonaldTrump. Their priorities are not America's priorities.  https://t.co/PNvG9Q6U95,2019-12-06 16:21:18,Twitter Web App,1,3
Nancy Pelosi now wants articles of impeachment after saying how divisive a partisan impeachment would be for the country.  Every member who voted in support of this process is Democrat. No bipartisanship. This is nothing more than a political hack job against on @realDonaldTrump.,2019-12-05 14:47:47,Twitter Web App,1,2
The #USMCA is a win for all of us. Nancy no more excuses. Pass Trump's #USMCAnow,2019-12-05 02:15:04,AgoraPulse Manager,1,2
This is what happens when elites in New York and California want to undo your decision to elect @realDonaldTrump.,2019-12-05 01:22:03,AgoraPulse Manager,2,1
This sham impeachment of @realDonaldTrump has always been about optics and politics. It's what happens House Democrats choose to divide our country instead of trying to work with our President.,2019-12-04 23:21:04,AgoraPulse Manager,2,12
During Clinton's impeachment now-Judiciary Chairman Nadler said "a partisan impeachment would tear the country apart.",2019-12-04 22:04:06,AgoraPulse Manager,5,11
The #USMCA is a big win for all Missourians. It helps our farmers &amp; ranchers with more open access to markets in Mexico and Canada.  We need to tell Pelosi to stop this impeachment sham &amp; focus on real results for Americans. #USMCAnow  https://t.co/NETfDoaC7Q,2019-12-03 19:44:34,Twitter Web App,1,0

Glad to see that a dozen Latin American counties have joined with the US to investigate and arrest senior Maduro administration officials. Many of these officials are engaged in drug trafficking and are working to finance terrorism.,2019-09-30 14:01:21,Hootsuite Inc.,0,0

When you hear liberal elites talk about the government’s money remember the government gets that money from you! It is not the government’s money it is the people’s money. Everyone pays taxes not just the 1%.,2019-09-25 18:20:11,Hootsuite Inc.,0,0

I enjoyed catching up with the great Republicans Saturday at Moniteau County's Lincoln Days—I share with them our wins under the Trump administration &amp; GOP leadership in Washington.

My democrat colleagues this week in HASC tried to say that we don’t have a crisis at the border and DOD need not have a mission there.  They neglected to mention that Congress has already approved a DOD counter drug mission with the ability to build fences/walls. https://t.co/66ye2MWS6p,2019-02-01 17:15:15,Hootsuite Inc.,0,0
