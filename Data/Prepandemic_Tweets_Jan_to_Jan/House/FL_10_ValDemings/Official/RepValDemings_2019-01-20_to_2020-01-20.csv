The wisdom of @RepZoeLofgren: Here we have a situation that is so obvious. The facts are so obvious.

.@HouseJudiciary has been debating #ArticlesOfImpeachment all day.  Let’s return to basics.  Trump asked Ukraine for a “favor” to help him get re-elected.  He abused his power to pressure them.

At first the White House told us to “get over it.” That they could do whatever they wanted no matter how corrupt.

Even more than his Ukrainian scheme the President’s behavior fits a pattern of disturbing and corrupt behavior.  He invited and welcomed election interference in 2016. Now the same in 2020.

This also debunks the false argument that the president simply doesn't like foreign aid.  He gave Ukraine the aid before 2019.  He gave them the aid after getting caught.

The scheme fell apart because the president got caught.  The president abused his power to coerce a country that was dependent on us to resist Russian aggression.

A reminder that every one of the 17 witnesses who testified to Congress about the president's abuse of power did so despite the president ordering them not to come.  The president tried to cover it up.  They testified anyway.  They put country before party.  #DefendOurDemocracy,2019-12-12 16:24:56,Twitter Web App,851,2267

The president's enablers say that he was extorting Ukraine because he wanted to fight "corruption."  How about we just ask the president himself? What did he want?
