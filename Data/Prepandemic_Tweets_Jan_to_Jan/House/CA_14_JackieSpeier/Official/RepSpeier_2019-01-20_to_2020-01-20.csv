It should alarm us all that over the last 200 years 90% of the Bay’s wetlands have been destroyed by human activity. While we have made some progress in restoring this national treasure to its former glory much more must be done. https://t.co/DFsZ2rPQfr,2019-02-12 21:45:50,Twitter Web Client,22,52

Today I reintroduced the bipartisan REPAY Act w/ @RepMarkMeadows @RepTedLieu and others. The bill would prevent wealthy Gulf nations from free-loading off US taxpayers when they buy our weapons.

I cosponsored the bill in CA making it the first state to pass paid leave in 2002. It's time for Congress to take this trend national &amp; pass the FAMILY Act.

Spoke to @CBSThisMorning @NorahODonnell about the nearly 50% spike in sexual assaults at our military academies. Heads should roll and cadets/midshipmen guilty of sexual assault / harassment need to be drummed out and on the hook for tuition costs. https://t.co/XUhlNK4DFO via,2019-02-01 15:53:06,Twitter Web Client,59,172

In the coming days I will be calling on the heads of our academies to  come to Washington to meet with me and explain how they will be  rethinking and redoubling their efforts to address this horrendous and  worsening problem.,2019-01-31 21:47:11,Twitter Web Client,9,52
This report also shows our future leaders aren’t being prepared to help stamp out sexual assault in our armed forces but will in fact perpetuate and worsen this scourge. Our service academies must lead the charge in protecting the dignity and respect of young men and women.,2019-01-31 21:46:45,Twitter Web Client,12,50
Attempts to address sexual assault in our academies have not only failed they've allowed rates to jump a staggering 47%. A record 15.8% of women &amp; 2.4% of men experienced unwanted sexual contact in the past year. 1/2 the women cadets/midshipmen reported being sexually harassed.,2019-01-31 21:45:43,Twitter Web Client,15,32
We expect military service academies attract the best &amp; brightest but this report suggests academic/athletic success does not equate to instilling respect &amp; honor hallmarks of American military service.
