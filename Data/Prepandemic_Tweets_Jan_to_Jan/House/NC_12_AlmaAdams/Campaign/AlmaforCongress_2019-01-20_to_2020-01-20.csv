Religious liberty is a fundamental part of what makes us American and I thank my Awesome God for blessing me with the opportunity to live in a country where everyone is free to worship how they choose or not at all. #ReligiousFreedomDay,2020-01-17 02:35:40,Twitter for iPhone,0,1
By standing up for religious freedom we stand up for our communities’ right to exist and be free and that is why we must join our siblings from other traditions in standing up against Islamophobia anti-Semitism religious discrimination and faith-based violence.,2020-01-17 02:35:39,Twitter for iPhone,0,1
Religious freedom is a foundational right. For those of us who grew up in the Civil Rights era we know that the freedom to exercise our faith goes hand in hand with the freedom to peaceably assemble the freedom to petition our government and freedom of speech itself.,2020-01-17 02:35:38,Twitter for iPhone,0,2
Today marks #ReligiousFreedomDay. Charlotte and Mecklenburg County are home to almost 1000 places of worship representing scores of faith traditions. We are a diverse community of people who profess many faiths or none at all.,2020-01-17 02:35:38,Twitter for iPhone,4,6

While we remember Dr. King fondly we should remember he had the courage to be hated in his lifetime. He knew that true peace was not the absence of conflict but the presence of justice. We can honor his legacy not by doing what is popular but by doing what is right. #MLK,2020-01-16 01:23:40,Twitter for iPhone,0,4
Martin Luther King Jr. would have turned 91 years old today. As we spend the next week honoring Dr. King’s legacy we should remember he fought not only for civil rights but also for economic and political systems that would bring about what he called the Beloved Community. #MLK,2020-01-16 01:23:39,Twitter for iPhone,4,10
