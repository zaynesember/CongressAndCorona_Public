In this Easter season let us pause to remember all those who sacrifice in the service of others. As Americans we sleep safely because brave men &amp; women stand watch over us always ready to come to our aid. Leah &amp; I send to them &amp; to all - our very best wishes for a Happy Easter.,2019-04-21 22:46:59,Twitter for iPhone,2,4
It’s always a pleasure to meet new folks throughout the Second District. I had a great time sitting down with Libby Hutto as well as Syd and Judy Riley from Jackson County last week and discussing my work in Congress. Mrs. Hutto makes a fine pimento cheese sandwich! https://t.co/IIzIvhI6MV,2019-03-28 00:22:24,Twitter for iPhone,0,3
