On Tuesday @RepDWStweets joined me for a tour &amp; briefing at @NSAPC12 &amp; @USCG Station PC. We surveyed damage from Hurricane Michael &amp; discussed the needs of our military in the Panhandle. https://t.co/LuZSaMnXQA,2019-02-21 21:53:33,Twitter Web Client,0,9
Last week I visited w/ students from Holy Comforter Episcopal School. These students traveled to DC from Tallahassee to learn about our 3 branches of government. These students had great questions on my work in Congress &amp; told me their thoughts on the recent govt shutdown. https://t.co/ZdrD2UDKdj,2019-02-19 19:29:51,Twitter Web Client,0,7
Hey @JeffBezos @amazon - Panama City &amp; Tallahassee FL are prime locations for HQ2! Elected officials in the FL Panhandle understand that your investment would drive our community forward &amp; economic opportunity helps those we represent to lead more fulfilling lives. #sayfie  #HQ2 https://t.co/AlIyae53iN,2019-02-15 16:57:07,Twitter Web Client,5,33
This bill falls short of providing necessary funding to secure our borders and is forcing @POTUS to declare a national emergency to get the job done. I believe we can and must do better. 6/6,2019-02-15 02:28:10,Twitter Web Client,3,7
Furthermore Democrats promised they would work with @realDonaldTrump to address border security - a promise they did not keep. 5/6,2019-02-15 02:28:10,Twitter Web Client,3,10
Florida’s Panhandle needs help now not six months down the road. It’s been 4 months since Hurricane Michael hit &amp; much of the Panhandle is still in ruins with people living in tents &amp; surviving on the bare essentials. We need to pass disaster funding &amp; we need to do it now. 4/6,2019-02-15 02:28:10,Twitter Web Client,9,12
I cannot in good conscience support a bill that completely ignores all those who were devastated by disasters in 2018. We cannot continue to kick the can down the road on disaster funding. 3/6,2019-02-15 02:28:10,Twitter Web Client,3,6
It includes no money for Hurricane Michael disaster relief does not seriously address the humanitarian crisis at our border &amp; was finalized at the last minute with little time for members to review the details. 2/6,2019-02-15 02:28:10,Twitter Web Client,2,4
The spending deal worked out by House and Senate leadership fails to address the needs of those in North Florida. 1/6,2019-02-15 02:28:09,Twitter Web Client,5,8
Today we remember the lives that were tragically cut short in Parkland one year ago today. Our hearts go out to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School community.,2019-02-14 23:36:21,Twitter for iPhone,0,3
We discussed a new workforce development program in the city and the different steps he is taking to improve Tallahassee. .@MayorOfTLH has been actively working to instill real change in Tallahassee and I believe he is moving in the right direction. https://t.co/u3kmMPC9kF,2019-02-13 15:37:44,Twitter for iPhone,0,3
Thank you to Tallahassee Ma @MayorOfTLH John Dailey for taking me around City Hall last week and introducing me to all of the hardworking staff who keep our State Capital running. https://t.co/88LQTz5SWT,2019-02-13 15:37:41,Twitter for iPhone,0,6
I look forward to seeing these students do great things in the years to come. Thank you to Joanna Colvin Sharon Odiorne and Assistant Principal Sherry Lohmeyer for inspiring young minds in Wakulla. https://t.co/pOISLlwQLF,2019-02-09 00:05:32,Twitter for iPhone,1,5
This week I was honored to meet with the Wakulla High School U.S. Government Honors class. These bright students had some great questions on my work in Congress and were truly engaged and interested in how our government works. https://t.co/DOEZPS99KB,2019-02-09 00:05:29,Twitter for iPhone,2,11
I hope Democrats in Congress will take @POTUS @realDonaldTrump words to heart and work with us instead of against us. #SOTU,2019-02-06 03:37:32,Twitter Web Client,1,8
Over the last two years we have seen record job growth &amp; incomparable economic strides. Just last month more than 304000 jobs were created &amp; we currently have the highest labor participation rate in six years. The state of our union is strong but it is also fractured. #SOTU,2019-02-06 03:37:32,Twitter Web Client,0,6
I believe we can accomplish great things in 2019 – including Hurricane Michael relief cracking down on the opioid epidemic fixing our crumbling health care system &amp; continuing the pro-growth American agenda that is benefiting hardworking people across this country. #SOTU,2019-02-06 03:37:31,Twitter Web Client,1,4
Tonight @realDonaldTrump laid out a bold plan for the country. He called for unity &amp; bipartisanship for Democrats and Republicans to work together. The folks back home in FL want to see results &amp; and they want their elected officials to work with @POTUS – not against him. #SOTU,2019-02-06 03:37:31,Twitter Web Client,2,16
Thank you @POTUS for fighting for the lives of the unborn. #SOTU,2019-02-06 03:04:47,Twitter Web Client,7,24

Tax cuts stronger economy reinvesting in our military slashing government regulations - @POTUS @realDonaldTrump has worked with us to bring real change to Washington. #SOTU,2019-02-06 02:19:37,Twitter Web Client,2,3
Stronger economy --&gt; "We have created 5.3 million new jobs and importantly added 600000 new manufacturing jobs -- something which almost everyone said was impossible to do but the fact is we are just getting started." @POTUS @realDonaldTrump #SOTU,2019-02-06 02:18:27,Twitter Web Client,1,1

Recently I joined the entire FL delegation in urging the Trump Admin to continue supporting Everglades restoration &amp; water quality infrastructure projects. Continued investment in FL's ecosystem is crucial &amp; will aid in addressing outbreaks of Red Tide &amp; Harmful Algal Blooms. https://t.co/g83Sq4z7Fm,2019-01-31 14:24:38,Twitter Web Client,0,6
Even members of their own party are urging Pelosi and Schumer to make a deal. Democrats in Congress need to join President Trump at the negotiating table and vote to reopen the government. 3/3,2019-01-25 16:11:01,Twitter Web Client,1,4
The offer would fund border security while also granting provisional status for three years to current DACA recipients and certain TPS recipients. Democrats did not even consider the offer or make a counter offer and simply dismissed it completely. 2/3,2019-01-25 16:11:01,Twitter Web Client,1,4
This shutdown has gone on long enough. It’s time for Nancy Pelosi &amp; Chuck Schumer to come to the negotiating table. Our federal workers are hurting. President Trump has put a bipartisan offer on the table that would both secure the border &amp; reopen the government.  1/3,2019-01-25 16:11:01,Twitter Web Client,3,9
