#CA39 Update: The shutdown highlighted that many Americans don't agree with a senseless border wall. But we do need to address immigration reform. I met with @SEIU members today to discuss DACA TPS &amp; creating common sense pathways to citizenship. https://t.co/CXEy7o00dw,2019-01-26 23:35:42,Twitter for iPhone,4,17

More importantly I hope we can move on &amp; work on the issues that our constituents elected us to tackle. Whether its protecting affordable healthcare veteran services common sense gun legislation or immigration reform I'm ready to move on &amp; get to work for the people of #CA39,2019-01-25 22:55:47,Twitter Web Client,5,19
It is important that we put partisanship aside &amp; do our jobs for the American people. I hope we can now move forward &amp; work together on real sensible solutions to keep our borders secure and our communities safe.,2019-01-25 22:55:47,Twitter Web Client,3,10
Not to mention the long-term damage the President has done to our economy. @HouseDemocrats voted 11 times on 10 separate bills to reopen the government &amp; each time we faced opposition from Senate Republicans.,2019-01-25 22:55:46,Twitter Web Client,3,6
This past month our federal employees and their families were put in a situation they did not deserve. I'm glad the President has agreed to re-open the government but disappointed that it took him 35 days. All the while American families were unfairly used as bargaining chips.,2019-01-25 22:55:46,Twitter Web Client,7,15

Today is day 35 of the President's shut down &amp; our public servants aren’t “sacrificing” they are being held hostage. Many are missing their second paychecks today. It’s past time to end this. #EndtheShutdown https://t.co/ee4CxAlVym,2019-01-25 17:28:16,Twitter for iPhone,4,10

I joined @HouseDemocrats to vote for the 11th time on bipartisan legislation to reopen the goverment and #EndTheShutdown.

Instead of ending this #shutdown POTUS continues to demand his useless border wall. @HouseDemocrats are taking concrete actions to invest in smart effective border security but the Senate Majority Leader refuses to do his job and take up the bipartisan legislation.,2019-01-23 23:03:28,Twitter for iPhone,99,357
I am honored to be joining the @HouseNewDems under @RepDerekKilmer leadership. I am committed to bringing #CA39's voice to promote economic growth &amp; fiscally responsible legislation.,2019-01-23 21:05:36,Twitter Web Client,2,18
Air quality in the US has improved dramatically over the past several decades thanks to the #CleanAirAct but our environmemt faces daily threats by the Trump admin.

The President said he was "proud to shut down the government." The pay of the men and women of federal law enforcement &amp; our homeland security community incl the Coast Guard FBI DEA should not be used as a negotiating tactic. Period. #EndTheShutdown,2019-01-23 16:06:26,Twitter for iPhone,27,67

Today marks the 46th Anniversary of Roe v. Wade. Yet we still have politicians that believe they have the authority to regulate what happens between a woman &amp; her doctor. We must continue to stand up for women' s healthcare rights &amp; protect #RoeVWade. https://t.co/UhIb0DgBXQ,2019-01-22 21:39:46,Twitter for iPhone,4,19
This #shutdown has gone on for 32 days. On day 1 Democrats voted to re-open the government with a bill that unanimously passed the Senate last year. It's on POTUS to act on bipartisan legislation and stop holding our federal employees hostage.,2019-01-22 18:35:41,Twitter Web Client,7,29
We must move to #renewDACA immediately. DREAMers are students teachers service members and community members. We owe them permanent protections. https://t.co/cEzIaAppXJ,2019-01-22 18:09:07,Twitter Web Client,6,12
The Supreme Court's decision to uphold the President's transgender troop ban is a discredit to their service and harms our national security. We need to stand against hate and protect the rights of our transgender service members. https://t.co/TLzz5kpe9d,2019-01-22 16:04:52,Twitter Web Client,11,25
