This is what’s wrong with Big Pharma. They say they want to lower prices but they’re not even doing it for their own drugs.

This is why we fight for the #ACA:  🔘20 million+ Americans have health insurance 🔘37 states have expanded Medicaid.

#CA39 sent me to Washington to get work done. That's what I did in 2019 and will continue to do in 2020.  The House passed nearly 400 bills last year 275 of which are bipartisan.
