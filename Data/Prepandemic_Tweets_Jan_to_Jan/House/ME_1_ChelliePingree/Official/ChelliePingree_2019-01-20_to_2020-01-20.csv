Access to healthy nutritious food is a fundamental right. This cruel #SNAP rule will only increase food insecurity in Maine and across the country.

Drilling for fossil fuels in the Gulf of Maine when we should be investing to renewable energy is like trying to put out fire by dousing it with kerosene. We must pass H.R. 1941 to #protectourcoast! @NRDems https://t.co/WGRhpjxOHT,2019-09-11 19:53:05,Twitter Web App,11,52

This morning #TeamPingree joined @CityPortland officials to remember those we lost 18 years ago today in the #September11th attacks.   @PortlandFD is hosting a 9/11 blood drive at the Portland Elks Lodge from 12PM - 5PM.

On a Tuesday morning 18 years ago America woke to historic tragedy. We still feel the loss of the nearly 3000 lives lost in the #September11th attacks.

Confusing labels like “buy by” “sell by” &amp; “freshest by” only contribute to food waste. My bipartisan bill with @RepNewhouse the Food Date Labeling Act would help standardize labels end consumer confusion around expiration dates and reduce food in our landfills. https://t.co/jY3DDV2k9V,2019-09-09 14:56:06,Twitter Web App,5,17
1/3 of the world’s food (≈1.3B tons) is wasted annually. When it goes to landfills it produces methane—a greenhouse gas roughly 25x more harmful than CO2.  From standardized food labels to apps connecting sellers + buyers all solutions should be on the table to cut #foodwaste. https://t.co/yjAiHB9mXX,2019-09-09 14:52:19,Twitter Web App,3,22

Since taking office in 2016 Trump has effectively zeroed out refugee admissions from many nations around the world torn apart by famine political unrest and war including Afghanistan &amp; Iraq.

That’s why I thought it was important to bring whistleblower @jclement4maine to the #SOTU tonight to give voice to those the Trump admin has tried to silence on the issue of #climatechange. 6/6 #mepolitics,2019-02-06 04:00:44,Twitter for iPhone,6,14
One important thing we didn’t hear in President Trump’s #SOTU tonight was a plan to address #climatechange. It’s disappointing that the President continues to ignore this real crisis even as he manufactures others. 5/ #mepolitics,2019-02-06 03:58:48,Twitter for iPhone,12,38
If President Trump is serious about the unity he spoke of in his #SOTU he should stop demonizing those who seek safety in our country and start working in good faith with Congress on immigration effective border security and funding the government. 4/ #mepolitics,2019-02-06 03:56:58,Twitter for iPhone,2,13
President Trump is right that the American people want both parties to work together in the country’s interest. The question is whether he will follow through on tonight’s #SOTU calls for unity with action. 3/ #mepolitics,2019-02-06 03:55:00,Twitter for iPhone,2,6
