We are 377 days away from an election. Instead of being transparent and presenting their case to the public @SpeakerPelosi and @RepAdamSchiff held another secret hearing behind closed doors today. Who is really working for the people?,2019-10-22 17:26:18,Twitter Web App,367,948
We are a legislative body and we speak after a vote is taken. Failing to do so allows unchecked factions to control the direction of the entire legislative branch.

According to this article…   Taxpayers spend $775/day for each migrant teen housed at a shelter in FL – while there they get schooling and recreation. They stay on average 67 days before being released to a sponsor. That’s $52000 per teen per stay. https://t.co/mJ8qw4lQBX,2019-03-18 17:41:57,Twitter Web Client,18,24

Tonight’s speech showcased the many accomplishments President Trump has achieved in the last two years. Our country is better off today than it was two years ago.,2019-02-06 03:56:30,Twitter Web Client,9,45
President Trump showed leadership tonight and clearly demonstrated willingness to reach across the aisle. #SOTU,2019-02-06 03:52:25,Twitter Web Client,13,86
I'll be joining @ValentineShow on @997wtn tonight at 5:35pm CT to share what I think @realDonaldTrump will discuss in tonight's State of the Union address. Tune in on your radio or listen online: https://t.co/Ld5sVEFqQV,2019-02-05 22:57:04,Twitter Web Client,4,7
Thank you to all who came to the Open House in Franklin Monday! https://t.co/LB9iZqqGRv,2019-02-05 22:51:15,Twitter Web Client,1,9
Despite the unparalleled opposition @realDonaldTrump has faced he's fought harder and longer than other president in modern history to keep the promises he made to voters on the campaign trail.  Looking forward to attending my first ever #SOTU tonight! https://t.co/LyySZiWpUa,2019-02-05 22:45:51,Twitter Web Client,6,35
In 2011 Obama declared a national emergency to crack down on transnational criminal orgs (like cartels) given they “reached such scope and gravity that they threaten the stability of international political and economic systems." But Dems oppose now? https://t.co/31HJJA1bPH,2019-02-05 18:41:52,Twitter Web Client,12,25
Blocking @BenSasse's Born Alive is an extreme unpopular stance. Almost 2/3 of Americans want to prohibit abortions after the baby is 20 weeks gestational age. Over 90% of Republicans and over 60% of Democrats want 'significant' restrictions on abortion. https://t.co/malTTCub0P,2019-02-05 17:30:01,Twitter Web Client,30,43
Man faces life in prison for causing miscarriage after kicking pregnant girlfriend's stomach. "It is basically a murder conviction" said the asst. prosecutor. Common sense says this is just but under new NY law he couldn't be accountable for killing baby https://t.co/QeiLr0ilgM,2019-02-05 02:20:01,Twitter for iPhone,18,30
Cost of progressive policies: - Medicare for All: $32.6 trillion over 10 years - Green New Deal: At least $5.7 trillion up front  Something doesn't add up.  If the rich can’t pay for these policies who will foot the tab??  Hint: It's us. https://t.co/isbHMEvp9O,2019-02-04 22:06:14,Twitter Web Client,96,245
Let’s do math!  Revenue gained if we soak the rich: - Sen. Warren’s tax plan: $2.75 trillion over 10 years - Ocasio-Cortez's tax plan: $720 billion over 10 years - Bernie’s tax plan: $315 billion over 10 years,2019-02-04 22:06:14,Twitter Web Client,37,93
This is not about women’s health. If you’re supporting ending the life of a child after delivery it’s murder. And if @PPFA can donate 3M to a candidate it should not get another penny of taxpayer money. https://t.co/AhTjgoereT,2019-02-04 18:25:29,Twitter for iPhone,88,148
.@SpeakerPelosi continues to refuse to come to the table and negotiate. She needs to stop listening to the hard left members in her ranks and work with the president for the sake of the country. https://t.co/y4FtmTlt4h,2019-02-04 18:00:21,Twitter Web Client,112,448

.@SenTedCruz introduced a simple bill that'd take El Chapo’s fortune of $14 bil (nearly triple the $5.7 bil requested) and use it to build a wall on our border and help prevent criminal empires like El Chapo’s from flourishing.  It’s so simple. Why haven’t Democrats signed on?,2019-02-04 15:00:26,Twitter Web Client,7,25
This monster capitalized on our unsecure border and made billions of dollars smuggling drugs and people into the United States for more than two decades. He created an illicit empire that has brought about terrible unimaginable human suffering. https://t.co/PNmPnrU2h9,2019-02-04 15:00:26,Twitter Web Client,8,16
Despite Nancy Pelosi forcing a government shutdown over border wall funding the economy didn’t take a hit. Experts guessed we’d only see 170000 jobs added in January. The Department of Labor just reported 304000 this morning. https://t.co/pHTksAluKz,2019-02-01 18:11:52,Twitter for iPhone,13,25
Do you remember this? During the third presidential debate Trump denounced partial-birth abortion explaining the process in stomach-churning detail. In her response Hillary Clinton gave a ‘robotic ghoulish response defending the practice.’,2019-02-01 16:21:00,Twitter Web Client,14,17
There is also an argument to be made as many have that Hillary Clinton lost the election to Donald Trump due to her extreme position on abortion.,2019-02-01 16:21:00,Twitter Web Client,9,23
The United States is only 1 in 7 countries worldwide that even allow abortions in the late term – 20 weeks or later. Joining us at the bottom of the 198 countries worldwide are notorious human rights offenders like China and North Korea.,2019-02-01 16:17:36,Twitter Web Client,20,20
.@GovernorVA and @vademocrats position is way outside the mainstream. New polling released in Jan shows 63% of Americans would ban abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy. 92% of Republicans and 61% of Democrats want “significant restrictions” on abortion.,2019-02-01 16:17:36,Twitter Web Client,15,26
Now more than ever the American people need clarification – where exactly does the Democratic party stand on the issue of abortion? Who will help us ask that question? Read more from my op-ed just posted at @resurgent: https://t.co/6JxE0xUNcK,2019-02-01 01:53:35,Twitter Web Client,102,152
Are Democrats really that scared that they believe Trump winning this fight will cost them the 2020 election? If that is the case they do not deserve the American people’s vote.,2019-01-31 17:42:26,Twitter Web Client,17,52
Democrats need to end their quixotic 2020 posturing and start doing their jobs immediately. A legislator’s job is to legislate so let’s come to the table and work on a solution.,2019-01-31 17:42:26,Twitter Web Client,11,44
We knew this would happen. The past year has shown us Democrats don't want to secure our border. They only care about one thing -- refusing the president a “win.”,2019-01-31 17:42:26,Twitter Web Client,8,35

Killing a baby once born is infanticide. Plain and simple.,2019-01-30 22:58:42,Twitter Web Client,16,36
Like a scene from a science fiction movie our elected officials are casually floating infanticide on the airwaves. Are we going to allow this affront to our civilization to happen unchecked? If so we’ve lost our soul. I am appalled. https://t.co/RtC5Y7j1lt,2019-01-30 22:58:42,Twitter Web Client,12,17

Americans shouldn’t have to navigate different states’ bureaucracies in order to bear arms – a right enshrined in our U.S. Constitution by the Second Amendment. Signing onto this bill is a no-brainer.,2019-01-29 16:10:44,Twitter Web Client,11,18
Meanwhile 132 bipartisan members of Congress are working to protect your rights with the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act -- a common sense bill allows law-abiding citizens who are qualified to conceal carry in one state also carry in other states that allow residents to do so.,2019-01-29 16:10:44,Twitter Web Client,12,17
Progressive House Democrats are readying attacks on the 2A and Americans’ constitutional rights.

Democrats must come to their senses and realize the crisis on our southern border is causing human suffering and we have a cure for it. We need to help the president administer that cure.

No one should celebrate any abortion but especially not in the third trimester.,2019-01-23 21:38:38,Twitter Web Client,19,46
As a M.D. I know exactly what happens to unborn babies when they’re aborted in the 3rd trimester. That’s why I’ve signed onto the Pain Capable Unborn Protection Act – a bill that would prohibit abortions after 20 weeks or when a baby begins to feel pain. https://t.co/w4klOSMohx,2019-01-23 21:38:38,Twitter Web Client,71,129
