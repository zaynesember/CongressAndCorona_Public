Even though the gov’t is open again the damage inflicted on people &amp; communities will be felt for a long time. We’re getting to work to clean up the kind of corruption that got us here. @HouseDemocrats are committed to building a better democracy that works #ForThePeople. https://t.co/iPtinbjlXV,2019-01-26 16:00:00,TweetDeck,9,43
The agreement to reopen the gov’t is good news for 800K fed employees their families &amp; all Americans. Pres. Trump &amp; Republicans’ decision to impose a shutdown for political leverage was destructive &amp; must never happen again. @SpeakerPelosi deserves credit for standing strong.,2019-01-25 20:41:18,Twitter Web Client,14,86
Treasury Sec. Wilbur Ross said ‘I don't quite understand why’ federal workers are visiting food banks.   Many workers can’t afford to miss one paycheck let alone the second they’re missing today. Yes the Trump admin is out of touch. #EndTheShutdown. https://t.co/jm3NN7UssA,2019-01-25 18:00:00,TweetDeck,8,10
The administration’s actions during the #TrumpShutdown are likely a violation of appropriations law &amp; an abuse of federal funds. I’m requesting oversight hearings and seeking public testimony to gather the evidence and hold them accountable. https://t.co/J7J57vtBoN,2019-01-25 17:24:39,Twitter Web Client,8,30
FAA is delaying flights at major airports due to staffing shortages caused by the #TrumpShutdown. Forcing air traffic controllers and TSA to work without pay is unfair to these public servants makes our skies less safe and hurts the economy. https://t.co/xXWhW5nDpe,2019-01-25 16:52:12,Twitter Web Client,5,14
Tomorrow valued federal workers will miss their second paycheck. They are being treated like pawns by this president -- and it is just outright cruel. #EndTheShutdown,2019-01-24 22:33:41,Twitter Web Client,9,31
President Trump and Republicans are willing to inflict pain on millions of Americans damage our economy &amp; put our nation at risk to get their way – all so the president can keep a campaign promise.,2019-01-24 22:32:17,Twitter Web Client,20,61
I’m about to speak on the House Floor about the devastating impact the #TrumpShutdown is having on federal employees and their families. https://t.co/iAjcjPdXCS,2019-01-24 22:20:51,Twitter Web Client,4,26
I have serious questions about the Trump administration’s actions during the shutdown and whether or not they are playing favorites and giving special treatment to the oil industry. https://t.co/bZZm6Nqbft,2019-01-24 21:53:01,Twitter Web Client,14,29
Thank you @RepMikeQuigley. Looking forward to working with you to ensure taxpayer dollars are invested wisely when it comes to protecting public health &amp; the environment.  https://t.co/6aB1V2TlvQ,2019-01-24 19:16:45,Twitter Web Client,5,18
The @EPA is responsible for enforcing the law against those who pollute our air and water. But under the Trump administration big corporate polluters are getting a pass. Last year civil fines for pollution dropped by 85%. https://t.co/8JL3Bre4y6,2019-01-24 18:55:46,Twitter Web Client,9,7
As the new Chair of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior Environment &amp; Related Agencies I’m disturbed that Trump admin actions during the shutdown may have violated the law &amp; misused federal dollars – so I’ve requested an oversight hearing. https://t.co/45PdDOyCOm https://t.co/w5EirUoc3p,2019-01-23 22:25:41,Twitter Web Client,166,325
179 House Republicans just voted against a compromise bill to reopen the gov’t. It was negotiated under Republican leadership and is the result of a conference between both parties. No more excuses: Stop holding the gov’t hostage &amp; inflicting pain on federal workers.,2019-01-23 20:57:31,Twitter Web Client,44,83
Programs in the Interior bill impact all of us: from preserving our natural and cultural resources to ensuring we have clean air to breathe and clean water to drink – today and for future generations. #EndTheShutdown.,2019-01-23 19:41:21,Twitter Web Client,2,10
This bill is the lifeline to restart funding and stop the senseless cruelty of the #TrumpShutdown. Basic services like health clinics &amp; food assistance for seniors are at risk for tribal communities. We need to make this right.,2019-01-23 19:39:04,Twitter Web Client,3,6
I’m delivering remarks on the House Floor shortly in support of H.R. 648 a bipartisan compromise bill which will immediately reopen the government. Republicans should finally join @HouseDemocrats and make sure federal employees can get paid. https://t.co/fd4eLK6e6N,2019-01-23 19:20:04,Twitter Web Client,15,21
Americans have had enough of President Trump’s #CultureofCorruption in Washington. With H.R. 1 @HouseDemocrats will clean it up and restore a government of by and #ForThePeople. https://t.co/1JKvHosLLF,2019-01-23 17:12:00,Twitter Web Client,7,11
The public comment period on mineral leases that potentially threaten the #BWCA our most popular wilderness area ends tonight. Because it fell over the holidays &amp; ongoing gov't shutdown my colleagues and I are asking for at least a 60-day extension. https://t.co/90WbAFpznw,2019-01-23 04:35:18,Twitter for iPhone,28,82
Today is the 46th anniversary of Roe v. Wade the landmark SCOTUS decision enshrining a woman’s constitutional right to a safe and legal abortion. Reproductive rights are in jeopardy now more than ever as the Trump admin continues its attack on women’s health. #FightForRoe,2019-01-22 20:21:15,Twitter Web Client,26,90
An entire month of the #TrumpShutdown has left American families wondering how they’ll cover basics like rent and groceries. @realDonaldTrump enough is enough: #EndTheShutdown. https://t.co/iuA0n2gMiM,2019-01-22 18:53:18,Twitter Web Client,4,13
Nearly all fed. funding to tribal communities has stopped under the #TrumpShutdown impacting healthcare infrastructure &amp; food distribution. People are suffering &amp; the U.S. is failing to meet treaty obligations to provide these services. #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/boXyzJsl0l,2019-01-22 17:56:39,Twitter Web Client,136,162
Restricting any transgender American from contributing their skills in service to our Armed Forces–because they are transgender–is state-sponsored discrimination. This right-wing Supreme Court is now Trump’s court and human rights civil rights &amp; women’s rights are all at risk.,2019-01-22 15:25:14,Twitter Web Client,115,288
The pristine clean waters of the #BWCA make it the most visited wilderness in America. @BLMNational must allow the public more time to weigh in on mining leases directly adjacent to the Boundary Waters (and complete a thorough EIS). https://t.co/TxUWP1div9,2019-01-22 01:16:20,Twitter for iPad,19,60
Attended breakfast at Mt. Zion Synagogue in St. Paul this morning to celebrate the life and legacy of Dr. King with members of the local community &amp; watch the #MLKBreakfastMN broadcast.

Today and every day our nation must remain committed to living out the lessons Dr. King prescribed: to speak up and defend our fellow Americans against bigotry and discrimination and to pursue equality and justice for all.

Holding the Interior-Environment gavel means putting a spotlight on this administration’s rollbacks on regulations ensuring we have air safe to breathe &amp; water safe to drink.
