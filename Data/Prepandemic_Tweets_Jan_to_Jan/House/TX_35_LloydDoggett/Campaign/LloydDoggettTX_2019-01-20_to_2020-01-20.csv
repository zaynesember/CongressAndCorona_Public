Despite the alarming findings in the Mueller report Trump can always count on his Republican enablers not holding him accountable. Not only Trump but every Republican who has empowered his reckless and harmful conduct must been held accountable. https://t.co/gXXX30drJC,2019-04-19 16:09:26,Twitter for Android,0,4
