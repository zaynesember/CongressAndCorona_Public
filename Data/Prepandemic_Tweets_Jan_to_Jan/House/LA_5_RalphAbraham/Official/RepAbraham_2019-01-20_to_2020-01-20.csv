Great evening last night in Pineville with some of @LaFarmBureau's True Blue farmers. Thanks for all you do for #Louisiana agriculture! #LA05 https://t.co/bZhsFxANpJ,2019-02-26 15:53:56,Twitter Web Client,1,13
Couldn’t have said it better myself! Louisiana crawfish is one of a kind world delicacy and I’m glad to welcome the return of crawfish boil season. https://t.co/UOD8ejhxUX,2019-02-25 00:00:00,TweetDeck,3,15
"‘Make sure they know I am not a hero' said the straight-faced Purple Heart recipient as we wrap the interview." Mr. Noss that’s where I think you’re wrong – you ARE a hero and I’m honored to serve you in Congress! https://t.co/PfdI5fm0Sp,2019-02-24 15:05:01,TweetDeck,0,10
Millie's story shows that no one is immune to the opioid epidemic. Families like the Harveys are why the House passed H.R. 6 last session the SUPPORT Act which provided millions of dollars in funding to Louisiana to address this crisis. https://t.co/IPnq4VttkY,2019-02-23 22:27:00,TweetDeck,0,10
On this date in 1945 U.S. Marines planted the victory flag on Iwo Jima. That image remains a powerful symbol of American courage and resolve. https://t.co/CJpZ9HdjW0,2019-02-23 14:35:00,TweetDeck,16,70
It’s National #EngineerWeek and some of the biggest advancements in the field are happening right in Louisiana at @LSU. I always enjoy seeing students (especially from my alma mater) pushing the envelopes of their industries. #GeauxTigers https://t.co/Cmth1rpeth,2019-02-22 19:15:00,TweetDeck,1,7
Congratulations to Richard Costello from Oak Grove on being named the 2018 Rice Consultant of the Year. Mr. Costello said it best when he said “If our farmers don’t make it at the end of the day then we are not going to make it at the end of the day.” https://t.co/EjNVRlGP1t https://t.co/IRdYmAdz5r,2019-02-22 15:00:01,TweetDeck,12,37
Yet another story that validates @POTUS's national emergency declaration. In the latest caravan headed for our borders there were at least 25 dangerous criminals. Walls work and had they reached our borders walls would’ve kept them out. https://t.co/0DNAQ0WTNg,2019-02-21 21:05:00,TweetDeck,3,8
It’s National FFA Week! As a former member I know that the future of agriculture is bright because of how this great organization is growing tomorrow’s ag leaders. https://t.co/bw9Dj9doka,2019-02-21 16:05:00,TweetDeck,1,12
Congratulations to the @ULMHawkeye staff! The Hawkeye was recently named the Best College Newspaper at the Southeast Journalism Conference. This type of achievement is not accomplished without countless hours of hard work and dedication across the staff. https://t.co/DJQ4H7ox6t,2019-02-20 23:01:00,TweetDeck,1,10
Rural broadband has always been a priority for me which is why I’ve supported including millions of dollars in funding for this initiative in the 2018 Farm Bill &amp; other bills. I look forward to working more in Congress and @POTUS to make this a reality. https://t.co/X2PRVJGChM,2019-02-20 20:05:00,TweetDeck,2,15

If we don’t stand for life who will? While other states’ leaders have vocalized support for aborting babies even if they are born alive I’m proud to walk with my fellow Louisianans to defend the sanctity of life and protect the unborn. https://t.co/U2bCGDArlG,2019-02-17 17:45:00,TweetDeck,8,23
Anyone who thinks our crisis at the border is “manufactured” should hear from Angel families around the country – those lost someone at the hands of criminals who were here illegally. https://t.co/yCanY8MDWZ,2019-02-16 15:15:00,TweetDeck,6,28

Thank you to @WashTimes for allowing @SenJohnKennedy @RepMikeJohnson @SenBillCassidy and me to author a column highlighting how Louisiana’s Cyber Corridor has quickly become a hub for cybersecurity education and jobs. https://t.co/qt0gQhqMrG,2019-02-15 21:00:01,TweetDeck,5,12
I’m thankful to have @SecretarySonny’s support on my recent soybean bill. The legislation I am introducing allows MFP payments to apply to planted acres instead of harvested ones. https://t.co/Lnh49gTxXr,2019-02-15 15:03:39,Twitter Web Client,4,15
This week we salute the more than 9 million veterans currently receiving care from the @DeptVetAffairs. Our heroes deserve the top level of care and I will continue to work to improve the VA and the care veterans receive at home. https://t.co/gQ4esBQvuj,2019-02-15 15:00:00,TweetDeck,1,12
If President Trump needs to declare a #NationalEmergency to keep out the drugs and gangs so be it because it's pretty clear that Democrats' only goal is to score political points with their radical open-borders base even if it means sacrificing national security. #LA05,2019-02-15 02:37:50,Twitter Web Client,8,44
I voted NO. This bill limits the number of illegal immigrants we can detain &amp; falls well short of adequate funding for a border wall. I couldn't vote for something that's going to dictate to the President whether or not he can protect our borders and keep our country safe. #LA05,2019-02-15 02:36:54,Twitter Web Client,5,35
As a pilot I’ve seen firsthand – from the cockpit – how aviation connects us to each other. Whether it’s flying from one coast to another to quickly transporting a patient to lifesaving care I don’t want to envision an America without air travel. #KeepOurPlanes #GreenNewDeal https://t.co/0FNbRN3mi1,2019-02-14 17:00:01,TweetDeck,3,13
I couldn’t agree more with my colleague and fellow doctor in Congress @RogerMarshallMD. I’ve spent my entire career protecting life and will continue to do so in Congress by supporting the Born Alive Protection Act and other pro-life legislation. https://t.co/A5QXQeYlko,2019-02-13 22:30:00,TweetDeck,3,23
The #GreenNewDeal is a socialist’s wish list. It focuses less on the environment and more on progressive leftist ideals under the disguise of creating a greener America. This bill is a true look at the shallow priorities Democrats have in Congress.,2019-02-13 18:47:16,Twitter Web Client,14,18

.@NationalSheriff and @MCSheriffs have called the Dem detention bed cap dangerous hindering to our law enforcement and a risk to national security.

Babies who survive abortions deserve medical care and the chance to live. I'm proud to be an original cosponsor of the Born Alive Survivor Protection Act and I'm pledging my support for @SteveScalise and @RepAnnWagner's effort to force a vote on this bill. #PreauxLife,2019-02-11 18:18:54,Twitter Web Client,420,1311

As a member of @HASCRepublicans I was proud to answer President Trump’s call to rebuild our military and support our nation’s heroes including giving our military well-deserved pay raise. https://t.co/sLMl0p5v0m,2019-02-06 03:20:56,Twitter for iPhone,4,21

“Let us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life.  And let us reaffirm a fundamental truth: all children - born and unborn - are made in the holy image of God.” Right on Mr. President.

I’m looking forward to having President Trump address Congress and the rest of the country tonight at the State of the Union.

This week I’m proud to support National School Choice Week.
