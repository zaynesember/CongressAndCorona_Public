The attacks from Gaza over the weekend deserve total and unequivocal condemnation. Over 600 rockets launched at Israel indiscriminately put innocent Israeli civilians in harm’s way.

When Acting AG Whitaker testifies before @HouseJudiciary on Friday we expect full and complete answers to all our questions. We have been very clear: President Trump must invoke executive privilege if Mr. Whitaker plans not to answer. I look forward to Mr. Whitaker's testimony. https://t.co/cmOHEwscD4,2019-02-07 00:33:37,Twitter for iPhone,246,626

On Tuesday Feb 12th @HouseJudiciary will hold a hearing with @DHSgov @TheJusticeDept &amp; @HHSgov officials to conduct long overdue oversight of the Trump Admin's callous family separation policy. It is time for a full accounting of this shameful policy. https://t.co/wHshdaNCnC,2019-02-04 22:00:00,Twitter Web Client,719,1650
Proud to co-sponsor &amp; be with @RepMaloney @cjewishhistory on her introduction of The Never Again Education Act (HR 5460).

Lights are back on at the #MDCBrooklyn #MDC!!!!   Excellent news.  I promise to look into why this happened and ensure that the BOP makes the necessary improvements so there is not a repeat of these horrendous conditions.  We must treat inmates with dignity and respect.,2019-02-04 01:05:36,Twitter for iPhone,715,3375
Latest on #MDC.  @ConEdison has restored the power connection to the prison.   The electricity should be working soon.,2019-02-04 00:43:47,Twitter for iPhone,129,526
Good news to report from @ConEdison    regarding the #MDC.  The BOP has completed the internal electrical repairs and @ConEd is now working on getting the power up.   Electricity hopefully will be restored at the #MDC soon.,2019-02-03 23:23:25,Twitter for iPhone,113,438
The #MDC obviously has physical plant issues.  I will be following up with BOP officials at HQ to make sure we resolve all of these health and safety issues. https://t.co/uZg6nZN0kq,2019-02-03 18:34:20,Twitter for iPhone,35,118
Just toured the #MDC and met with the Warden.  Conditions are much better.  It’s much warmer.  And the electrical power will be back tomorrow morning.   We will remain vigilant to insure that the health and safety of the inmates and correction officers are taken care of properly.,2019-02-03 18:31:11,Twitter for iPhone,749,2860
Need to figure out what the situation is today.  Want to make sure the heat is working and that legal representation can visit the inmates today.,2019-02-03 16:41:57,Twitter for iPhone,90,399
Back at #MDC right now.  Talking to inmates family members outside on the prison.  Lots of inmates with medical conditions and unsure if they’re getting their medicine.   Will be going inside to talk to the warden. https://t.co/nMVMlVUIoj,2019-02-03 16:40:38,Twitter for iPhone,110,327
I will be heading back to the MDC Brooklyn later this morning at 11:30am to get an update and find out what the Bureau of Prisons is doing about the inhuman conditions inside the facility. Zero heat and no electricity is simply unacceptable and must be addressed immediately. https://t.co/9NCT39gq1b,2019-02-03 15:23:03,Twitter for iPhone,535,1508
Good news - Just heard from the Brooklyn Federal Defenders Office after days of no contact the MDC will be open to legal visitation tomorrow.   It is important that the rights and safety of the inmates are protected and documented.,2019-02-03 04:59:59,Twitter for iPhone,870,3811
Here’s an update on the situation at the MDC. Thanks to @BilldeBlasio and @nycoem blankets and hand warmers and generators are on the way to prison.  Just because you’re  incarcerated does not mean that we don’t treat you with dignity &amp; respect.  Heat &amp; hot water is not a luxury,2019-02-03 00:51:20,Twitter for iPhone,1310,4500
@NydiaVelazquez and I just spoke with BOP Acting Administrator again and we are attempting to get the agency to accept emergency assistance. Thank you to Federal Defenders and the activists reporters for keeping the spotlight on this injustice.,2019-02-02 21:00:55,Twitter for iPhone,9,32
I will be demanding that BOP get the contractors back on site immediately.  The lack of urgency in addressing this crisis is inhumane.  I will be talking to Acting BOP Administrator Hurwitz this afternoon.  This is unacceptable.,2019-02-02 19:57:26,Twitter for iPhone,172,522
The MDC has only partial heat and electricity. The electrical contractor is not at the facility.  There is a general lack of urgency from the prison officials.,2019-02-02 19:56:04,Twitter for iPhone,238,423
After visiting the MDC it is clear that BOP officials have been callously placing the health &amp; safety of the inmates at this facility at risk. https://t.co/hE4I8fUINy,2019-02-02 19:51:48,Twitter for iPhone,341,624

I have spoken with BOP Acting Director Hurwitz and am enroute to tour the MDC. I’m outraged it has taken this level of attention for BOP to take action to prevent detainees from freezing to death.,2019-02-02 18:01:25,Twitter for iPhone,727,2350
I will be outside the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) Brooklyn in Sunset Park this afternoon at 1pm with @NydiaVelazquez to demand immediate action by BOP to ensure the health and safety of prisoners being kept in freezing cold conditions without proper heat or electricity. https://t.co/bXTVe1sqju,2019-02-02 15:14:18,Twitter for iPhone,345,1001
