Human trafficking is all too prevalent in our country &amp; it’s imperative that we do all we can to address it - both in TX02 and nationally.

This deal is a win for America: our workers our businesses our economy &amp; for holding China accountable.

Iranian proxy wars and escalatory violence have been going on for years. I know I was there.   Now that we’ve weakened the Iranian regime we should be rallying behind the Iranian people. #FreeIran https://t.co/pRZ1L0zylj,2020-01-13 23:56:58,Twitter Media Studio,1311,6359
Curious that @twitter would classify a video of Iranian student protestors defying the regime as sensitive.

#NationalHumanTraffickingAwarenessDay serves as a reminder of the importance of raising awareness. Through education we can empower Americans with the knowledge to help stop this crime once and for all which is why I hosted the symposium.

Human trafficking is a serious problem throughout the U.S. so much so that I brought in experts from around the country to my Human Trafficking Symposium this past October to raise awareness and discuss solutions to this heinous crime in Houston and the country.,2020-01-11 22:08:40,Twitter for iPhone,765,4664

Congress should be commending our men and women who made this possible instead of wrongly suggesting to them that their actions were wrong.  I offered H.

No there isn’t an imminent ground war or WWIII.   No the options are not (a) do nothing and (b) all-out war. There is a lot in between i.e. striking a terrorist leader to re-establish deterrence.

It is what I’ve worked to protect and defend every day since I took my first oath in 2006. It’s what our country was founded on. It’s the greatest collection of ideas this world has ever known.

Just the latest example of Iran’s aggressive campaign for regional instability.  Iran removed any reason for doubt this weekend.

To quote Deputy Buchkar “No matter what you can go above and beyond.” As we reflect on the anniversary of 9/11 this week let’s take a moment to thank our first responders and law enforcement who like those on 9/11 as well as Buchkar go above and beyond to protect our country,2019-09-12 17:47:57,Twitter for iPhone,95,958

September 11th. 18 years later. It was a day of immense loss that forever changed us. But it was also a day when Americans fought back. The passengers of Flight 93 fought back.

That math explains why you think we can pay for Medicare for all and a Green New Deal by just “taxing the 1%.”  All countries with these massive entitlements tax the middle class far more than we do.

At this point we need to be asking a serious question:   We know Dems don’t want to fix this problem but why? What could possibly be the motivation?   They hate Trump?

Highly recommend tuning in to the Homeland Security Cmte hearing today with @SecNielsen so you can watch Dems do mental gymnastics trying to convince us there is no emergency on the border.

Why does the left hate the tax cuts? Bc they think the people exist to fund the govt. We believe the govt exists to protect the inalienable rights of the people.

There are still members of Congress - all Dems - reflexively clinging to support of the tyrannical Maduro regime.   This is wrong on a foreign policy level &amp; a moral one.
