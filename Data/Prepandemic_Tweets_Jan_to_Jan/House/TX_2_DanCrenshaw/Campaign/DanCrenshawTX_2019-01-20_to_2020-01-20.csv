Odd...I was told Soleimani’s death would unify the country behind the regime. I guess their protesters didn’t get the memo from western media.  #FreeIran                                                  #ايران_آزاد https://t.co/anDH3nBPg6,2020-01-13 04:28:11,Twitter for iPhone,5145,19532
But he agreed with POTUS assessment it could be embassies.  Here’s how this works: Officials receive intel &amp; make assessments. CIA DNI Joint Chiefs agreed the intel was very clear &amp; it’d be more dangerous to not act.

Our small &amp; cost-effective force in Northern Syria plays an important role in maintaining stability and the upper hand on ISIS.

Just so I’m clear: you think my friends are domestic abusers/criminals? Seriously that’s your argument? That they can’t pass a background check?  Wrong.

This is the 1st mass shooting where a universal background check *possibly* would have prevented him from having a gun if and only if they decided to self-enforce that law.

144k apprehensions in May. 32% increase from April. Highest figure in 13 years.  We clearly need border security &amp; asylum reform but instead the House passed a bill that would give amnesty to far more ppl than even Obama’s DACA policy.  Enough already.

Latest in stalled border security negotiation:  Dems want less detention beds so that we can’t hold as many people who break the law. We would have to release them.  They actually want to make it harder for DHS to enforce the laws that Congress wrote.   This is terrible policy.,2019-02-10 18:50:33,Twitter for iPhone,12776,40303
@realDonaldTrump sends aid to Venezuelans and socialist President Maduro blocks it.   Actually BLOCKS his own people from getting aid.

The fact that the Green New Deal also eliminates new carbon-free nuclear energy indicates this plan is not about carbon emissions.   It’s about destroying our economy so they can build a socialist one.   To Dems’ credit at least they’re being more honest about their extremism.,2019-02-08 23:41:44,Twitter for iPhone,11808,41126

@ColumbiaBugler That’s exactly where these numbers came from. That’s my whole point. This plan came from years of analysis by DHS. I’m trying to help people understand that.,2019-02-03 15:30:08,Twitter for iPhone,98,625
@lokibeat That is part of the #2 option. I would encourage everyone to research the actual plan proposed by the President. It includes more immigration judges and more detention facilities sonwe can adjudicate cases much faster. It’s a holistic solution.,2019-02-03 15:28:26,Twitter for iPhone,124,592
Border security the actual choices:  1. Status quo with 400000 illegals apprehended per year.  2. Dept of Homeland Security Request: 234 miles of new fencing where they’ve identified a need plus other tech.  $5.7 B price tag  3. 2000 mile wall $25 B price tag  We choose #2,2019-02-03 15:09:31,Twitter for iPhone,7963,28147
@notherelater @RepDanCrenshaw His district covers sectors of the border with natural barricades and very little traffic. I would urge Will to think of the border in holistic terms instead of just his district. The President’s plan only calls for fencing where BP has identified a need. Not the whole border,2019-02-02 18:20:12,Twitter for iPhone,20,43

@juliettekayyem I’m trying to give you the benefit of the doubt here since I know you from Harvard but it’s difficult. Answer this question honestly please: why does a drug bust at a POE prove your case that fencing shouldn’t be used in between POE’s? You realize they are separate issues right?,2019-02-01 17:13:41,Twitter for iPhone,68,290
@bondcliff @hm_roth @RepDanCrenshaw That’s why the President’s plan calls for walls in certain places that Border Patrol has identified technology in other locations and reforms to asylum process that reduce incentives. This is not a “sea to shining sea” border wall proposal.,2019-02-01 04:21:52,Twitter for iPhone,78,348
@muchojordan @RepDanCrenshaw @nwlaguy Yes Jordan that’s exactly what these stats are telling us. All of the arrests in this sector 94% occur where there is no wall. The wall in the eastern side (same terrain) results in dramatically less crossings.,2019-02-01 04:18:52,Twitter for iPhone,6,74

When you’re trying to cross a border and there’s a 20-plus foot steel slated barrier in your way it seriously inhibits your ability to cross. A sensor tells a Border Agent miles away that they have to find you now.  I wonder which one works better.      #WednesdayWisdom,2019-01-30 12:59:00,Twitter for iPhone,10963,39723

America must have a serious border debate.  Make no mistake:  1. This is a debate between porous borders and secure borders  2. This is a debate between security experts who understand the role of secure fencing and those who believe (wrongly) that sensors and drones are enough,2019-01-27 22:02:45,Twitter for iPhone,7533,27630
