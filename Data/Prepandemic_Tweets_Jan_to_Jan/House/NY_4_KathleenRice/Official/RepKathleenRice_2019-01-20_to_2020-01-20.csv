With the impeachment managers confirmed it's now time for our colleagues in the Senate to uphold the oaths they took to the Constitution.   The American people deserve no less than a fair trial where witnesses are called and Senators act as impartial jurors. https://t.co/qRrSoLuncv,2020-01-15 19:21:25,Twitter for iPhone,4,20

The House passed HR 8 &amp; HR 1112. Two bipartisan bills that would expand &amp; enhance background checks.

Once again Mueller laid out extensive evidence of obstruction by the President and made it clear that the President hasn't been exonerated.

In the last week we've learned of at least 2 American citizens who have been detained by CBP/ICE.  The administration's immigration policies are clearly broken.

These images are offensive and sickening and the Roosevelt School District must ensure that those responsible are fully held accountable.   Our schools must always be safe spaces for everyone. #NY04 https://t.co/l0tyYJBsie,2019-02-11 15:50:29,Twitter Web Client,4,15
Sending my thoughts and prayers to the family of Congressman Walter Jones. He was a deeply devoted public servant and an incredibly thoughtful and hardworking Member of Congress. He will be missed by all. May he rest in peace.,2019-02-11 01:32:43,Twitter for iPhone,3,22
Ignoring the deadline for the Magnitsky report is completely unacceptable and flies in the face of our nation's values and interests.  By failing to act the President only emboldens #Khashoggi's murderers. https://t.co/LLwQhEQiIh,2019-02-08 23:01:32,Twitter Web Client,15,35
Today the House passed the Veterans’ Access to Child Care Act which would make the program permanent &amp; expand it nationwide!  This bill will ensure that no veteran ever has to choose between medical treatment and child care.  I look forward to seeing it signed into law soon!,2019-02-08 17:16:20,Twitter Web Client,3,16
In 2011 the @NorthportVAMC was one of the first 3 facilities in the country to participate in the VA’s child care pilot program.  It was a total gamechanger for our veteran parents and caretakers.  #ChildCare4Vets,2019-02-08 17:16:20,Twitter Web Client,2,11
This is why I'll be reintroducing the Students &amp; Families Empowerment Act which would remove the arbitrary $2500 cap on deductions for student loan interest &amp; extend the repayment grace period to a full year.  Congress must do more to address this issue. https://t.co/ngPK2abMxz,2019-02-08 15:57:52,Twitter Web Client,9,30
The GOP's assault on the middle class continues.  Millions of families in NY &amp; across the country will pay thousands more in taxes this year because of the cap on #SALT deductions.  This is unacceptable. @ChuckGrassley is putting big corporations before hardworking Americans. https://t.co/Pwc1i9Vxhl,2019-02-07 20:07:43,Twitter Web Client,5,10
A major step forward for common sense life-saving legislation.  @HouseDemocrats are finally taking real action to prevent gun violence.  I could not be prouder to support this bill. https://t.co/6ItiEL8bUD,2019-02-07 18:47:04,Twitter Web Client,3,31
FACT: Women are the fastest-growing population of veterans. And 42% of female VA users said they struggle to find childcare when they need to attend medical appointments. We can fix that with the Veterans’ Access to Child Care Act. #ChildCare4Vets https://t.co/SeZ9jkFMic,2019-02-07 17:59:17,Twitter Web Client,8,17
Proud to join my colleagues in signing both these letters. Inmates are human beings and they deserve to be treated that way. There must be accountability for what happened at #MDC.

During tonight's #SOTU we heard more fear-mongering more divisive rhetoric and more partisan posturing with a few empty words about unity.   And we heard nothing about climate change or gun violence.  This is no different than the past two years and it's not going to cut it.,2019-02-06 04:24:38,Twitter Web Client,20,77
We’re wearing white to tonight’s #SOTU  to honor the suffragettes who came before us. I could not be prouder to serve alongside this historic class of women. Together we will fight for women’s rights and #EqualPay! https://t.co/QjKGp8peEV,2019-02-05 22:44:36,Twitter Web Client,13,65
Here's to hoping the President uses his #SOTU to address issues that actually matter to hardworking families – like healthcare infrastructure &amp; income equality – instead of continuing his divisive &amp; destructive fear-mongering.  The American people deserve responsible leadership. https://t.co/qB5jAJ0gbn,2019-02-05 17:36:43,Twitter Web Client,5,21
Our top priority in Congress must be to avoid another government shutdown.   But this bill would be a critical safeguard for the NY's federal employees many of whom went 5 weeks without pay during the last shutdown.

Congress will finally hold a hearing on an epidemic that kills tens of thousands of Americans every year. This is long-overdue.   It's amazing what can happen when the majority of the House is NOT beholden to the #NRA. https://t.co/GVtqW37VHV,2019-01-31 16:05:38,Twitter Web Client,87,161

10 years ago today the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act was signed into law. While this legislation was a big step forward in the fight for #EqualPay we still have work to do. In #NY04 women make 86 cents to a man's dollar. That's why I'm proud to support the Paycheck Fairness Act.,2019-01-29 22:03:49,Twitter Web Client,6,32

Absolutely right!  Contract workers &amp; their families are experiencing unimaginable hardship &amp; instability because of the shutdown. Congress must pass H.R. 339 which will ensure contractors receive the back pay they deserve.

Relieved that this shutdown is over but beyond frustrated at how needless and avoidable it was. This is the same bipartisan agreement we reached a month ago. We have to do better in the weeks ahead. We owe that to all the federal workers &amp; families who braved weeks of hardship.,2019-01-25 20:33:34,Twitter Web Client,15,51

I met with air traffic controllers in my district 2 weeks ago. #NY04 has the busiest TRACON in the country.   They faced staffing shortages even before the shutdown. And now they've been working 60-hour weeks w/out pay. Their situation is untenable. We need to #EndTheShutdown. https://t.co/tBMYZEyacb,2019-01-25 16:04:07,Twitter Web Client,12,18
Terrific day for NYS! When students like Karen can go to college Long Island wins. The #NYDreamAct will open doors for thousands of hardworking young people.
