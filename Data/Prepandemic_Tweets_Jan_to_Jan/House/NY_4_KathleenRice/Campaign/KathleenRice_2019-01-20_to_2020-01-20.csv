.@StopBigMoney has released their first legislative scorecard and I'm incredibly proud to receive an "A" rating for my efforts to end corruption in Washington.  We need a government that works for all of us not special interests. https://t.co/2aEOTzQFYy,2020-01-16 15:43:35,Twitter for iPhone,4,12

I'm excited to announce my support for @PeteButtigieg! Pete represents the new voice and fresh perspective that we need in Washington. He's focused on bold yet commonsense policies that will unite our country. And he has what it takes to beat Donald Trump. https://t.co/H2QqIps4Mk,2019-11-26 14:26:15,Twitter Web App,535,3756

Give me a break.  Our background checks bill has been sitting on McConnell’s desk for 200+ days.  The NRA has thwarted every effort at gun violence reform for decades.  And Trump has walked back every commitment he's ever made on this issue.  So you tell me who isn't helping. https://t.co/MyxoxBUQIx,2019-09-22 16:57:39,Twitter Web App,5,5
