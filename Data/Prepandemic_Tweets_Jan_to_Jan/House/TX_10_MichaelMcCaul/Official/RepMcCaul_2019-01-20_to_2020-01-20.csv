Fact → The ‘Democrat Politician Protection Act’ is a colossal Washington-knows-best one-size-fits-all power grab intended to do one thing: serve the interests of politicians not the American people. #HR1 You can read my full statement on this bill here: https://t.co/GIoD5n2oQn,2019-03-08 16:44:11,Twitter Web Client,0,2
