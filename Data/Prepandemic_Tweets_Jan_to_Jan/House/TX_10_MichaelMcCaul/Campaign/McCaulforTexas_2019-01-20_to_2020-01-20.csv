On China trade deal Sen. Chuck Schumer thinks @realDonaldTrump  "should throw it in the garbage." Sounds about right for someone who opposes the USMCA.   2 trade deals in 2 days.

When Osama bin Laden was killed we all came together to applaud that decision. Sadly House Democrats are too concerned with political calculations to give @realDonaldTrump credit for taking out Qasem Soleimani a terrorist responsible for the deaths of 600 Americans. https://t.co/dIKFXAeAtX,2020-01-14 23:44:00,TweetDeck,4,8
It's unacceptable that House Democrats are BLOCKING both of these measures:  1) Commend the US military for taking out Qasem Soleimani of Iran a terrorist responsible for the deaths of 600 Americans 2) Declare US support for pro-freedom protesters challenging Iran's tyranny https://t.co/8QHqCDyHvl,2020-01-14 22:06:44,Twitter Web App,3,6

The premise of this week's war powers resolution is flawed. We're not at war with Iran &amp; @realdonaldtrump is not trying to start one.
