@SecPompeo @LeaderHoyer @StateDept @HouseForeign We know a lot more now but @SecPompeo continues to ignore a duly authorized subpoena.   What else is he hiding?

@SecPompeo @LeaderHoyer @StateDept Less than a month later she was recalled for no good reason.   That’s why @HouseForeign began looking into this situation and Giuliani’s involvement. https://t.co/U3ASl5dUZB,2019-11-25 14:20:40,Twitter Web App,19,32

Hindsight is 20/20. Now that we know more facts—incl that @SecPompeo &amp; Giuliani were in contact—it’s clear why Pompeo was silent when Amb.

The scourge of gun violence can happen anywhere. Thankfully a violent shooting was prevented. It is important that if you see something you say something.

As with #CitizensUnited &amp; Shelby today’s #SCOTUS ruling will forever affect our ability to have free &amp; fair elections.

The Constitutional Amendment I’ve proposed #HJRes9 would do that and more. https://t.co/ggsRFd0CUC,2019-03-01 15:16:29,Twitter Web Client,66,184
The days of empty "thoughts and prayers" in response to #gunviolence are over.   @HouseDemocrats are committed to passing tougher gun laws that will keep Americans safe. https://t.co/cfq5XgcAjM,2019-02-28 19:45:27,Twitter Web Client,10,35
For President Trump to side with Kim about the murder of Otto Warmbier is outrageous and builds on the President’s bizarre record of cozying up to strongmen and tyrants. https://t.co/ujgjTIu8wc,2019-02-28 19:14:12,Twitter Web Client,45,135
Today we passed historic legislation to require universal background checks. I cast my vote for #HR8 in honor of 2 of my constituents: Shamoya McKenzie &amp; Michael Nolan 2 promising young lives cut tragically short by #GunViolence. We honor them &amp; the memories of thousands more. https://t.co/XyUMRJRcDe,2019-02-28 01:01:55,Twitter for iPad,49,295
After years of obstruction by #GOP leadership today we passed a major piece of #gunviolence prevention legislation w/#HR8 Bipartisan Background Checks Act.   It’s nice to finally be able to move the ball forward on gun safety w/o having to take over the House floor in protest. https://t.co/p76AMiEX9X,2019-02-27 21:35:53,Twitter Web Client,6,31
It’s time.   #Healthcare is a human right not a privilege.   As a founding Member of the House Medicare for All Caucus &amp; a longtime supporter of this measure I was proud to stand with @RepJayapal and 100 colleagues today as we reintroduced the #MedicareForAll Act. https://t.co/hKIv3GinEp,2019-02-27 19:04:39,Twitter Web Client,34,178
The Constitution is clear: Congress has the power of the purse.   If the President’s emergency declaration is allowed to stand it will undermine the balance of power between the President and Congress and set a dangerous precedent. #FakeEmergency,2019-02-27 00:54:33,Twitter Web Client,10,34
From the beginning this national emergency declaration was a farce.   It was a gross power grab by a desperate President who even after manufacturing a #FakeEmergency still couldn’t secure funding for his ridiculous wall.   I was proud to cosponsor &amp; vote YES on #HJRes46. https://t.co/Gz7UR6f01l,2019-02-27 00:52:55,Twitter Web Client,12,43
My thanks as always to Jon Stewart John Feal and all the remarkable people who come to Washington to fight for the thousands of responders &amp; survivors suffering from 9/11-related illness.

.@HouseDemocrats stand united against the #FakeTrumpEmergency which was a blatant power grab by @POTUS. Tomorrow we'll vote on the joint resolution intro'd by @JoaquinCastrotx that protects our Constitution's separation of powers.

A gross rambling speech that is dripping with xenophobia and falsehoods.   Declaring a national emergency at the border is a farce.

One year ago today 17 beautiful lives were taken from this world by #GunViolence.    One year later @HouseDemocrats move the first major piece of gun control legislation in decades.   This is how we must honor the memories of those lost in #Parkland &amp; everywhere else. https://t.co/Efql2i6ofE,2019-02-14 15:44:11,Twitter Web Client,7,21
We’ve all seen the horrific images of civilian casualties in the #Yemen war.   Ongoing military operations are bringing us no closer to a resolution.  The only way out of this mess is for parties to sit down &amp; work toward a political solution.   #HJRes37 will help do that. https://t.co/3kBlQbgyYX,2019-02-14 02:05:48,Twitter for iPad,5,26
Today the House stood in a moment of silence to remember the 1 year anniversary of the tragic loss at #Parkland. But the House has been silent for too long on #GunViolence due to the #GOP. @HouseDemocrats are changing that and it is my hope we will soon vote on #HR8.,2019-02-13 19:51:20,Twitter Web Client,18,56
The @SenateGOP are so stuck in their anti-science alternate universe they seriously believe tackling #ClimateChange is a farce that will hurt Democrats politically.
