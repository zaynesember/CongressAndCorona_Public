I would also like to announce a $13.6 million @USDOT grant for three connector roads near I-77 in @MooresvilleNC.   These new roads will make it easier and safer for folks to travel shop and build. #NC13 https://t.co/gArcXN3fPP,2019-11-06 18:52:36,Twitter Web App,6,11

Today I stood alongside Sen. @ChuckGrassley @SenThomTillis &amp; Rep. @jdanbishop to announce the Immigration Detainer Enforcement Act.   This bill takes away all the excuses from sanctuary cities.

America is a land of second chances. Barriers to employment should not follow a person long after they have served their time paid their debt to society and started a new life.   People deserve the freedom to redeem themselves. #CJR https://t.co/Q5z3KY97Cc,2019-10-24 14:55:52,Twitter Web App,9,27
@FinancialCmte I also asked Mr. Zuckerberg about Facebook's efforts to protect our data and prevent their proposed payment system (Libra) from being used for nefarious purposes like terrorism human trafficking or money laundering. @FinancialCmte https://t.co/Oeilnc1QVO,2019-10-23 19:40:07,Twitter Web App,17,109
Today I had the opportunity to question Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in the @FinancialCmte. I told the committee:   “If we are to remain a world leader in financial technology it is vital that this committee not embrace reactionary laws against #cryptocurrency.” https://t.co/0OBgURlaCu,2019-10-23 19:37:55,Twitter Web App,249,921
@FinancialCmte I also made sure that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will continue to prioritize getting out of taxpayer-backed conservatorship.  The longer Fannie &amp; Freddie are interfering in the private housing market the higher the risk of a taxpayer-funded bailout. @FinancialCmte https://t.co/MR4KpxDWN1,2019-10-22 20:17:33,Twitter Web App,22,42
Today in the @FinancialCmte we clearly debunked the myth that the Trump administration is trying to "end affordable housing."

For the first time in American history the impeachment of a duly-elected president will take place in secret.   This is profoundly unfair and not worthy of Congress.

I have finalized and sent a letter to Speaker Pelosi along with 20 of my colleagues asking her to bring the Green New Deal up for a vote in the House.

Mark thank you for your leadership on the 2nd Amendment - I am proud to support you. The truth is this bill wouldn’t do anything to solve the problem of gun violence. I will be voting against H.R. 8 on the House floor this week. https://t.co/56eSvYnsuV,2019-02-26 17:21:19,Twitter Web Client,3,10
The radical left has staked out an extreme position on abortion that was highlighted recently by the Governors of New York and Virginia and again last night in the US Senate.

Last night the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act failed to get the 60 votes required for passage in the US Senate.  This was a simple one.  It would have required doctors to care for babies who survived an abortion the same way they would for a baby in a hospital. 1/2,2019-02-26 15:28:05,Twitter Web Client,8,23
Yesterday I was in Kernersville visiting the VA Hospital and learning more about how they are serving our nation's heroes.

I visited the border just last month. I talked with border patrol about their lack of resources and saw some of the most vulnerable spots.

I believe that Congress can and should do better which is why I have co-sponsored legislation by Rep. Andy Biggs to keep the government funded so that we can keep working to better secure our southern border. 3/3,2019-02-14 21:08:09,Twitter Web Client,8,44
My biggest concern is that the bill contains less than $2 billion for wall funding. I am also worried about parts of the bill that would tie the hands of Department of Homeland Security agents trying to do their jobs. 2/3,2019-02-14 21:08:09,Twitter Web Client,2,21
Tonight I will be voting against the Conference Report that was released earlier today. I don't think that it adequately addresses the serious problems that are going on at our southern border and that I've seen firsthand. 1/3,2019-02-14 21:08:09,Twitter Web Client,4,35
Today I signed onto the El Chapo Act. This legislation would take money seized from the Sinaloa cartel in Mexico and divert it to fund border security including the wall on our southern border.

These tweets by @IlhanMN are an example of the anti-Semitism we've seen recently. It should have no place in our society but especially in Congress.
