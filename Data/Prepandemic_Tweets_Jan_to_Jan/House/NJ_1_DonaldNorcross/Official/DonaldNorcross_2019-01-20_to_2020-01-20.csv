ICYMI—Sec. of Education Betsy DeVos failed to answer simple @EdLaborCmte questions yesterday.  I was asking about her support of anti-union groups who try to prevent teachers from organizing for higher wages. She started talking about something different. #1u @AFTunion @NEAToday https://t.co/WvWkwBB8Tm,2019-04-11 15:57:11,Twitter Web Client,0,2
As Sec.

I stand with these NJ advocates &amp; everyone who wants to expand not diminish access to care.   By punishing providers who choose to offer the full range of reproductive care using non-federal funding the Trump Administration is jeopardizing the health of millions of Americans. https://t.co/QhUmP3aje2,2019-02-25 20:15:40,Twitter Web Client,2,8
We must fully fund the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund &amp; make it permanent.   Thank you @RepMaloney @SenGillibrand @SenSchumer @SenatorMenendez @CoryBooker for your leadership.

This response is infuriating! ⬇️  Summary: Mexico wouldn’t pay. A Republican-controlled Congress wouldn’t pay. Then GOP &amp; Dems wouldn’t make Americans pay. This is his “faster” — only — option left &amp; it’s a disgraceful unconstitutional option. https://t.co/OuZXzyasD4,2019-02-15 17:29:46,Twitter for iPhone,4,17
