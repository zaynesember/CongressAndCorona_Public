I am very disappointed that Speaker Pelosi has delayed @realDonaldTrump’s State of the Union. For the sake of bad politics she has stooped to a new low. However I look forward to hearing from @POTUS in the near future about what he hopes to accomplish during the 116th Congress!,2019-01-25 01:10:03,Twitter for iPhone,10,24

Time and again @POTUS has proven that he is willing to compromise and work with members on both sides of the aisle to end this partial government shutdown.
