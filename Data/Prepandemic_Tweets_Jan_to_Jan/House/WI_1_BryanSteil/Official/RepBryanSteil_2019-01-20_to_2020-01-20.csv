Today we remember the six million Jewish victims of the Holocaust and thank the heroes our WWII veterans who risked their lives to defeat Nazism. Let us honor the lives of those we lost and remain vigilant against all forms of evil and anti-semitism. #WeRemember https://t.co/krXY0cjT0q,2019-01-27 18:31:56,Twitter for iPhone,4,13

Now that we have a deal let’s get to work on a permanent solution to fund the government and secure our border.,2019-01-25 21:04:00,Twitter Web Client,0,15
Today I grabbed coffee with a local mother whose daughter serves in the Coast Guard. Her story is like many others throughout the country right now. We must do our jobs find common ground and end this shutdown. https://t.co/ORmrax7NRp,2019-01-25 18:10:31,Twitter for iPhone,2,13
Hitting the road this morning for a busy day in #WI01...I knew it was cold...I didn’t think it was THAT cold! https://t.co/z6B7vqAzTg,2019-01-25 14:21:18,Twitter for iPhone,3,11
A couple of things...  1- Today’s vote in the House was more political theater not a solution to end the shutdown 2- We should be in D.C. tomorrow and every day until we reopen the government  Let’s do our jobs stay in D.C. and end this shutdown!,2019-01-24 19:58:32,Twitter for iPhone,7,17
The Coast Guard's commitment to serving our country is admirable. Many are reporting to duty without pay to protect our nation. The shutdown should've ended 34 days ago but if it lasts a day longer we must pass this bill today so @USCG can receive pay. https://t.co/cpjGLB31m0,2019-01-24 17:33:46,Twitter Web Client,2,4
Every child should have the opportunity to attend a school that is best for them. In fact 81000 students in Wisconsin attend a private voucher or a charter school. #SchoolChoice https://t.co/qnbQCKqiQx,2019-01-24 15:05:21,Twitter for iPhone,5,11

Yesterday I toured Kinetic in Greendale. It’s critical that Southeast Wisconsin workers have access to quality affordable education so they can be prepared for jobs of the future. Closing the skills gap will result in higher wages for workers in #WI01! https://t.co/rJtcjVlpnx,2019-01-22 15:09:04,Twitter for iPhone,0,8
Attended today’s One Voice Many Stories #MLKDay celebration at @gatewaytech in Kenosha. Great to honor those in Southeast Wisconsin who continue to inspire and embody MLK’s spirit.   “Life’s most persistent and urgent question is ‘What are you doing for others?’” -MLK https://t.co/YbkmmfXwLX,2019-01-22 03:01:57,Twitter for iPhone,0,5
Today we honor the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr. I joined the Southeastern Wisconsin Baptist Pastors Fellowship for their Dr. King’s Celebration event on Friday—a great evening. We should all strive to incorporate MLK’s teachings into our daily lives and communities. #MLKDay https://t.co/DjLuMQ4DjG,2019-01-21 14:55:24,Twitter for iPhone,1,12

Today President Trump offered a path to end the shutdown. Now it is time for Senate Democrats and Nancy Pelosi to display a similar willingness to compromise and finally bring an end to this impasse. I'm hopeful that with the president’s offer real progress is finally possible.,2019-01-20 00:35:57,Twitter Web Client,9,20
