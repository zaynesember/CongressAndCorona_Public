. @RepJerryNadler we’ve served on this Committee and even as Chairman and Ranking Member alongside each other. If nothing more I ask that you at a minimum take the time to bring fact witnesses to testify about the alleged quid pro quo.,2019-12-12 22:54:26,Twitter Web App,14,36

You want to talk about an abuse of power?    What the House Democrats are doing here is a clear case of abusing their office for political gain.,2019-12-12 22:49:31,Twitter Web App,19,44
When Congress disagrees with a particular assertion of executive privilege the remedy is not impeachment. The remedy is to go to court and let the third branch of government decide who is correct.,2019-12-12 22:47:22,Twitter Web App,17,35
Executive privilege is a time-honored constitutionally protected right of each and every Administration. And it has been asserted time and time again by Administration after Administration.,2019-12-12 22:45:09,Twitter Web App,11,31
Let me make this clear — asserting executive privilege is not in any way shape or form obstruction.,2019-12-12 22:44:44,Twitter Web App,53,173
The second Article of Impeachment is nearly as ridiculous as the first. An obstruction charge requires a concerted effort to interfere with or impede a Congressional investigation.,2019-12-12 22:43:35,Twitter Web App,14,51

.@HouseDemocrats If that’s the best you’ve got you wasted a whole lot of time and taxpayer dollars all because the leftist Democrat base hates this President.,2019-12-12 16:40:39,Twitter Web App,24,54
Let me put it another way — the entire argument for impeachment is based on a charge that is not a crime (much less a high crime) and that has NEVER been approved by the House of Representatives in a Presidential Impeachment.,2019-12-12 16:39:04,Twitter Web App,18,40
In the Nixon and Clinton impeachments abuse of power was a tacked-on charge far less important in those cases than the actual high crimes charged against both men. Here it’s the main thrust of the House Democrats’ entire case.,2019-12-12 16:37:54,Twitter Web App,6,29
There is another significant difference between the abuse of power charges against Nixon and Clinton and those presented here.,2019-12-12 16:37:04,Twitter Web App,29,101
Based on the actual facts of this case (as opposed to the hearsay and innuendo compiled by the Intelligence Committee) it doesn’t appear that an abuse of power even took place and there certainly isn’t enough evidence to support an article of impeachment.,2019-12-12 16:36:02,Twitter Web App,7,22
Fourth despite all the efforts to establish evidence of a quid pro quo by House Democrats Ukraine did nothing to assure the release of the aid. There was no public announcement of an investigation. In fact it doesn’t appear that the investigation was even opened.,2019-12-12 16:34:46,Twitter Web App,5,29
Third Ukraine actually received the aid after the President was satisfied that Ukraine had taken meaningful steps to address corruption. Which again is an obligation required by law.,2019-12-12 16:28:33,Twitter Web App,16,37
President Trump was well aware of that fact and quite skeptical of giving Ukraine foreign aid long before the now-infamous July 25 phone call.,2019-12-12 16:27:12,Twitter Web App,6,22
Second it’s a widely known fact that Ukraine is one of the most corrupt countries on the planet. It’s why Congress required the Administration to certify that the Ukrainian government had taken steps to clean up corruption before military aid could be provided to the country.,2019-12-12 16:22:52,Twitter Web App,8,24
First there was no quid pro quo.,2019-12-12 16:20:53,Twitter Web App,7,24
In this case the evidence provided is even less convincing. In fact I’d argue it is 𝐰𝐨𝐞𝐟𝐮𝐥𝐥𝐲 𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐝𝐞𝐪𝐮𝐚𝐭𝐞.,2019-12-12 16:11:33,Twitter Web App,1,9
In the interests of fairness I believed that Bill Clinton had abused the power of his office but we failed to convince our colleagues. The facts didn’t satisfy the higher burden of proof and that particular charge was rejected by the full House.,2019-12-12 16:10:09,Twitter Web App,6,13
What they don’t mention is that the House of Representatives has NEVER adopted abuse of power as a charge in a Presidential Impeachment.,2019-12-12 16:09:07,Twitter Web App,4,12
In their newly authored memo on constitutional grounds for impeachment the majority on this Committee goes to great lengths to explain why abuse of power is an impeachable offense specifically mentioning it was one of the charges against both Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton.,2019-12-12 16:08:19,Twitter Web App,6,12
Impeachment is reserved for instances of “Treason Bribery and other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.” It’s not “Treason Bribery other high Crimes and Misdemeanors” OR whatever else Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff deem impeachable.,2019-12-12 16:05:58,Twitter Web App,16,50
The Constitution is pretty clear on what constitutes an impeachable offense.,2019-12-12 16:04:54,Twitter Web App,4,14
