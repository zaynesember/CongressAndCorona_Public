Big thanks to guest host @MarkSteynOnline for having me on "The Rush Limbaugh Show" to outline how Democrats have made a mockery of due process and the Constitution through their obsession with impeaching our president @realDonaldTrump. https://t.co/A7kg0GDt9u,2020-01-16 14:55:11,Twitter Web App,43,78
Great time talking with @seanhannity today about the Democrats' sham of an #impeachment and all the other priorities from infrastructure to the opioid crisis the House should have been focused on instead.  https://t.co/RoKZe41i3r,2020-01-15 21:30:27,Twitter Web App,21,10
I'm excited to start 2020 with my campaign in a stronger position than ever before to highlight my record of delivering results for hardworking Ohio families and establish a contrast with my opponents who are obsessed with impeachment and a radical agenda https://t.co/obaqltNEKB,2020-01-09 19:03:39,Twitter for iPhone,28,19
It’s official. For just the 3rd time in our nation’s 243-yr history a president has been impeached. Dems made history for all the wrong reasons. It's time to reject their partisan abuse of power and focus on delivering results for hardworking OH families. https://t.co/12uGVeFZuI,2019-12-19 14:11:34,Twitter Web App,3,9
I am fighting to combat the opioid crisis end sex trafficking create jobs lift wages and support Ohio small businesses. I look forward to earning the support of Ohio voters next year and continuing to fight for common-sense results for Ohio families.  https://t.co/4CcfOzXGFe,2019-12-11 13:58:54,Twitter Web App,20,10

Thank you @IngrahamAngle for having me on to discuss the impeachment farce! One Democrat even said they have to impeach @realDonaldTrump or he might be reelected. It's time to focus on results for hardworking families and end this hyper partisan charade.  https://t.co/WezAAna8Eg,2019-12-10 15:32:22,Twitter Web App,2,4
By pushing ahead with their impeachment craze without any semblance of fairness or due process Democrats prove their objective is to undo the results of the 2016 election. That's why I am fighting hard to defend our president and get DC back to work.  https://t.co/d0BVB5pfBt,2019-12-09 20:29:14,Twitter Web App,7,24
Great time attending the campaign kickoff for Hamilton County Prosecutor @VoteJoeDeters in Sharonville and running into our ORP chairman @JaneyMurph! https://t.co/lRsPn3pdpQ,2019-11-17 13:46:22,Twitter for iPhone,2,21
Democrats in the House are abandoning any semblance of bipartisanship and undermining due process in their hyper-partisan quest for impeachment. https://t.co/GDdw43yU7E,2019-11-12 20:55:37,Twitter Web App,2,6

I believe the people’s House should spend its time doing the work of the people rather than engaging in baseless partisan witch hunts.  Unfortunately far-left politicians like Nancy Pelosi and my Democratic opponents choose resistance over results.  https://t.co/1VIFbKDfsW,2019-10-31 16:22:51,Twitter Web App,2,10
Incredibly honored to have the support and endorsement of Hamilton County GOP chair @ChairmanAlex and Warren County GOP chair Jeff Monroe.

I believe the people’s House should spend it’s time doing the work of the people — delivering results. But not Nancy Pelosi and her allies like my opponents @NikkiFosterOH and @KateForCongress. They want to divide America with their obsessive push for #impeachment.,2019-09-24 22:24:56,Twitter for iPhone,6,14
This is the problem with the radical left. All they care about is tearing down the president with incendiary rhetoric. They have no interest in results and root against our economy everyday. https://t.co/xzSG3lvFJu,2019-09-24 22:07:59,Twitter for iPhone,6,24
Far-left Democrats like Nancy Pelosi and my opponent @NikkiFosterOH are obsessed with #impeachment. Enough with the sideshow in DC. I’m focused on what matters to hardworking Ohio families like combatting the opioid epidemic cutting taxes and supporting small businesses.,2019-09-24 21:28:43,Twitter Web App,3,8
