Dr. Maya Angelou said “When someone shows you who they are believe them.” The bipartisan claims the President offered last night make nice sound bites. He has yet to take actions that support those claims. #SOTU,2019-02-06 18:36:13,Twitter for iPhone,16,32
The President did not mention climate change or gun control in his #SOTU. These are critical issues that require immediate action. https://t.co/iWip1oMODG,2019-02-06 18:36:12,Twitter for iPhone,15,34
The President laid out a sweeping vision to end the HIV/AIDS epidemic in his #SOTU. Yet last year he proposed a budget cutting millions of dollars from programs aimed at prevention and support for individuals living with HIV/AIDS. https://t.co/prqtIYhmWV,2019-02-06 18:36:12,Twitter for iPhone,1,1
And the President has repeatedly prioritized bigotry over military readiness by banning trans individuals from serving their country. His rhetoric last night does not match his actions which put his personal agenda ahead of our country. #SOTU,2019-02-06 18:36:12,Twitter for iPhone,2,3
Last night the President said he supports our military. But he let military families go 35 days without pay while they still reported to work.

Hypocritical empty rhetoric. Those are the 3 words I chose last night to describe the #SOTU. POTUS continued to lie stoke fear and demonize immigrants all while making claims that are contradicted by his actions the past two years in office. https://t.co/mbZCqLTqai,2019-02-06 18:36:11,Twitter for iPhone,12,29

Our mission is urgent the moment ripe w/ hope for my Venezuelan friends. US &amp; global demcracies back speedy elections humanitarian aid and a peaceful transition to Guaido as interim president.

Trump is willing to sacrifice defense and troop readiness for a border wall boondoggle. Democrats are not. https://t.co/O9FNpINYxo,2019-02-01 18:50:48,Twitter for Android,27,94
Republican definition of a 'power grab': More people voting  When your policies are that bad you want voters to stay home.  https://t.co/2Nx2MXEKfw,2019-01-30 13:58:29,Twitter for Android,22,64
In a record year for women it’s vital that Moms in the House have a sisterhood of support. When family is a top priority in Washington Congress can help ensure families remain America's top priority.        https://t.co/dHIQ8vkwAD,2019-01-29 17:39:30,Twitter Web Client,14,68
We know 800000 federal workers and their families were hurt but the #TrumpShutdown needlessly wounded our businesses and economy. https://t.co/feKQSjru8V,2019-01-28 19:55:50,Twitter for Android,18,41
You know what was missing from these disappointing comments by @TomBrokaw? We all need to work on meeting each other halfway learning to live together harmoniously loving one another and weaving our beautiful American tapestry.

Florida has suffered yet another mass shooting and our hearts go out to the Sebring victims. But that can't be it. I'll oppose any responses that call for more guns on our streets or in our schools and continue to fight for basic gun reforms until this senseless bloodshed ends.,2019-01-23 22:11:42,Twitter Web Client,228,1120
Trump is trying to ban qualified patriotic Americans from protecting our nation. Today's SCOTUS decision allowing this ugly discrimination to proceed against transgender troops is a harsh reminder that this White House puts bigotry before national security. #TransMilitaryBan,2019-01-22 18:09:13,Twitter for Android,51,147
