The President is rightfully celebrating our nation’s military but he left Coast Guard members like Morgan Somma’s husband without pay for 35 days. Morgan is the Congresswoman’s guest tonight at the #SOTU.,2019-02-06 02:25:25,Twitter for iPhone,1,12
The President says he is working for the middle class. Yet he just presided over the longest shutdown in U.S. history destabilizing American families in service of his own agenda. His actions cut at the dignity of our federal workforce and cost billions of dollars. #SOTU,2019-02-06 02:22:20,Twitter for iPhone,16,44
Tonight while @RepDWStweets attends #SOTU her staff will tweet from her account. Today the Congresswoman shared her priorities for the nation: protecting our democracy our health and our economy https://t.co/rsOsliUegb,2019-02-06 02:04:34,Twitter for iPhone,0,1
I am grateful to Morgan for speaking out about the real human cost of the President’s impetuous decision. It is an honor to have her join me tonight as a representative of the 800000 federal workers who suffered through the longest shutdown in U.S. history. #SOTU https://t.co/aQFEq1FL5w,2019-02-06 00:20:15,Twitter Web Client,0,1
Just this week @USCG members offloaded 17 tons of seized cocaine at Port Everglades. These are the hard-working individuals whose paychecks the President used as a political bargaining chip. #SOTU https://t.co/9CdhNLM4uH,2019-02-06 00:20:14,Twitter Web Client,0,0
More than 16000 federal workers in FL went without pay during the #TrumpShutdown. One was the husband of my #SOTU guest tonight Morgan Somma. During 35 days without pay Morgan worried about how Coast Guard families would make ends meet.,2019-02-06 00:20:14,Twitter Web Client,1,1
The president I fear will use the #SOTU to divide distract and bully his way toward a border wall that’s no more than a totem to taxpayer waste cruel intolerance and personal vanity.   https://t.co/rsOsliCDoD,2019-02-05 23:42:07,Twitter Web Client,0,1
It has been 100 years since Congress passed the 19th amendment. Today @HouseDemWomen are wearing white to honor those who fought to secure this most sacred constitutional right. We are fighting for the economic security of women and families. #StateOfTheWoman #SOTU https://t.co/3rWITuscY5,2019-02-05 22:57:32,Twitter for iPhone,7,24
I am prepared to fight what would be a reckless and dangerous decision. There is no national emergency requiring a border wall – just a President determined to erect a monument to ego and xenophobia at the expense of our nation’s military readiness. #SOTU,2019-02-05 21:54:56,Twitter Web Client,2,1
As the chair of the Appropriations subcommittee that oversees funding for the VA and military construction I know the critical projects which would have their funding put at risk if the President declares a national emergency tonight. #SOTU,2019-02-05 21:54:56,Twitter Web Client,1,1
I joined @RepTedDeutch to talk about the #PACTAct a bipartisan effort to #ProtectOurPets. The federal government must take this seriously for the sake of animal rights and public safety. Thanks @senatornanrich @browardsheriff @humanenbroward and @HumaneSociety for teaming up. https://t.co/Klh8tNiZWY,2019-02-04 22:47:58,Twitter for iPhone,1,1
History left untold is history erased. We must highlight the untold stories that show the work ingenuity strength resilience and power of black people – who traveled to unfamiliar destinations for a better life for their families &amp; themselves. #BlackHistoryMonth https://t.co/f8E3uh0XiI,2019-02-02 19:17:19,Twitter Web Client,4,7
Finally! Voters elected @HouseDemocrats to take action on America's gun violence epidemic. This is what Democracy looks like.  #HR8 https://t.co/KPI0aehVcE,2019-01-31 20:23:04,Twitter Web Client,1,1
When we stand together we can do anything! It’s been 10 years since the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act became law – but we're not done. It’s time to make #EqualPay the law of the land and pass the #PaycheckFairness Act! https://t.co/dbZo4BQxJd,2019-01-30 19:41:38,Twitter Web Client,2,4
In Washington we are united behind a free and democratic #Venezuela. Proud to stand with interim President Juan Guaido’s Chargé d’Affaires of the Government of Venezuela Carlos Alfredo Vecchio. https://t.co/8l3OEGe1tg,2019-01-30 00:29:02,Twitter Web Client,4,17
Proud of my #sistersurvivor @repgwenmoore for bravely sharing her battle with #cancer. Thankful she is in remission. She has been there for me and I will be there for her. Cancer doesn’t know who it’s messing with! #beatcancer https://t.co/UyQ5QW6fXt,2019-01-29 18:37:21,Twitter for iPhone,0,3
Families of all sizes were financially hurt by the #TrumpShutdown including the @USCG members we count on to protect our borders. I met with Coast Guard families today who felt that pain and for them I’ll do all I can to avoid another needless painful shutdown. https://t.co/Q0PC2yPPnk,2019-01-28 17:40:55,Twitter Web Client,2,8
On #HolocaustRemembranceDay we honor millions of Jews and other victims murdered in history's worst genocide. This atrocity started w/ dehumanizing words &amp; ideas. Today we see a resurgence of this type of hatred. Only education remembrance will counter these forces. #WeRemember https://t.co/iHcpWpQTrl,2019-01-27 21:28:03,Twitter Web Client,0,3
Today 800000 families didn’t get a second paycheck due to the #TrumpShutdown. Now he's causing countless Americans to miss flights home see loved ones and conduct vital business. How many lives will Trump harm for his border boondoggle? It’s beyond time to #EndTheShutdown. https://t.co/yoB4ukbqvW,2019-01-25 17:14:44,Twitter Web Client,5,8
A #SebringShooting can get lost amid Trump's White House mayhem. This too-common violence must be addressed to honor the tragic victims and to stem America's gun death epidemic. So much we can do. A good start: #HR8  https://t.co/jBM5tTpSmN,2019-01-24 22:48:31,Twitter Web Client,5,5
A furloughed worker in my community lived paycheck-to-paycheck. Home fixes sapped her savings. She already missed a mortgage payment and faces a 2nd lost paycheck. The cruel #TrumpShutdown hurts too many innocent families. #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/neW13sYuA3,2019-01-24 16:29:58,Twitter Web Client,3,4
The #TrumpShutdown has dragged on more than a month. @realDonaldTrump must stop holding American families &amp; our economy hostage to his wasteful ineffective wall. #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/tIPQ7u6sSq,2019-01-23 16:46:30,Twitter Web Client,0,0

I’m NOT the only one who &lt;3s Roe. Surveys regularly show a majority of voters want to protect a woman’s right to an abortion. And I will proudly stand with that majority to #FightForRoe. #Roe46,2019-01-22 18:30:51,Twitter Web Client,8,19
No one furthered racial and economic justice in America’s quest for true democracy more than Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. His courage to fight bigotry poverty &amp; war energize today's fight for voting and civil rights battles that still carry the stain of racial injustice. #MLKDay https://t.co/bqm3NxU8hO,2019-01-21 14:36:08,Twitter Web Client,0,1
