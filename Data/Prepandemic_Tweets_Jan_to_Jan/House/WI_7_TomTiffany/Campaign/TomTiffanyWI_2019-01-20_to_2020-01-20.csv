The cost of college is outrageous. I get it I have two daughters in college. Just like we froze tuition in Wisconsin we have to get the federal government out of the student loan business that drives up the price of college! #NBFDebate,2019-12-13 01:55:05,TweetDeck,0,2
As a dad I saw the miracle of life enter this world at the births of my three daughters. Their lives are precious to me. You can count on me to fight for life and defund Planned Parenthood. #NBFDebate #prolife https://t.co/mTSvXqxSLB,2019-12-13 01:50:48,TweetDeck,2,1
Chris and I sent our daughters to public school. But I also support parents who send their kids to private online or charter schools — or if they homeschool. Government shouldn’t get in parents' ways. #NBFDebate #itrustparents https://t.co/VzKzcfBVZY,2019-12-13 01:44:45,TweetDeck,5,13

In Wisconsin I’ve turned a $3.6 billion deficit and turned it into a balanced budget tax cuts and a surplus.
