Nobody who puts in honest work at a full time job should be living in poverty. But sadly that's the case for too many Americans.

Very pleased that @Lyft has taken my recommendation to expand its Grocery Access Program to Indianapolis as well as other cities across America.

Very alarmed by the @nytimes report that Pres. Trump didn't want to talk to his advisers about Russian efforts to hack the 2020 election.
