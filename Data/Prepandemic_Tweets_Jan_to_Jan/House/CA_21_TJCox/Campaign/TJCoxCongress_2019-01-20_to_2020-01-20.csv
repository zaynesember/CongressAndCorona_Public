My door is always open for my brothers and sisters in labor.   Yesterday I met with the leaders of @SEIU521 and we discussed how legislation I’m working on like equal pay and ensuring worker’s rights to organize will deliver for working families. https://t.co/kARrEOIAY2,2019-11-09 18:40:26,TweetDeck,13,30

We MUST #ReformFirst if we have any hope of building a system that puts working families first. I'm glad folks are getting on board to support the #ForThePeople Act and fix our political system. @StopBigMoney https://t.co/DHIOGgYb9f,2019-07-31 19:00:00,TweetDeck,12,23

The USCMA is critical for farmers and ranchers in the Central Valley - it is not “whatever”. Millions of jobs depend on Congress doing *its* job and passing this trade deal  https://t.co/ryGe1wqQ9V,2019-04-05 14:51:53,Twitter for iPhone,7,16

This is completely unacceptable and would strip healthcare away from hundreds of thousands of people in the Central Valley. The ACA will never  be safe until we have new leadership in the White House https://t.co/ifWturEK0R,2019-03-26 15:49:56,Twitter for iPhone,25,69

Proud to be in the first group of candidates to be endorsed for re-election in 2020! The people of the Central Valley work hard. They deserve leaders who will go to bat for them not for corporations and corporate priorities - that’s why I’m fighting every day #ForThePeople https://t.co/YR6JbjogGp,2019-03-20 19:13:24,Twitter for iPhone,14,47
The President’s demonizing our immigrant communities is one reason they lost #CA21 last November (his plan to undermine our healthcare system was another). As the son of immigrants I will always stand with our immigrant neighbors against this reckless hateful rhetoric https://t.co/8NG9sO8Ydv,2019-03-14 17:22:17,Twitter Web App,7,31

We win when we engage voters on the issues that matter to them. We lose when we take the support of any group for granted. Dems have to deliver on the promises we made in 2018 and continue to engage those who chose us to lead  https://t.co/xb2xWpoqj3,2019-03-11 14:47:58,Twitter Web App,7,28
We won by outworking our opponent - speaking to every voter we could in whatever language they knew best about the issues that matter most to them. And we aren’t stopping now https://t.co/LwNsKPxayt,2019-02-26 21:51:22,Twitter for iPhone,18,76
