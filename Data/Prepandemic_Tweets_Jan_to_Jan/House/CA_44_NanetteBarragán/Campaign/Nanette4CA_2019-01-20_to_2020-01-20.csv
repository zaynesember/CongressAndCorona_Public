Congratulations to Democratic Governor-elect Andy Beshear. As Trump said this is a bad sign for Trump. Let’s make this a bad sign for Moscow Mitch too. #kyelection #KYGov https://t.co/c7XyUclKhv,2019-11-06 03:25:08,Twitter for iPhone,3,10

What a wonderful honor to be there to see this moment and to hear the outpouring of support Chef Andres received at Nats stadium. As the daughter of immigrants this moment made me proud. #WorldSeries2019 https://t.co/R7lmouR9gD,2019-10-28 05:48:00,Twitter for iPhone,1,16
Our thoughts and prayers for your speedy recovery President Carter. Your voice of reason human rights and dignity is appreciated and critical during these difficult times. Stay strong! https://t.co/hm0nAIpgRW,2019-10-22 12:03:51,Twitter for iPhone,1,2

Sad but not surprised. This administration doesn’t seem to be tell the truth to anyone even Congress. It’s like a drip of information to hide the horrors of their zero policy. We must make sure this doesn’t happen again. https://t.co/sbKpxGK09v,2019-10-21 02:55:46,Twitter for iPhone,0,5

Watch as our committee marks up HR3 a critical bill needed to lower prescription drug prices #ForthePeople. This bill would allow the negotiation of drug prices to lower costs.

@nesto_92 One of my favorite memories of my dad. He paced up and down the hallway unable to watch from being nervous. Will never forget his scream of joy when he heard of the homerun moments after.,2019-10-16 04:53:11,Twitter for iPhone,2,1

And we wonder why hate crime is on the rise why a man drives thousands of miles to shoot immigrant communities why media is targeted and disrespected. This is what the President’s rhetoric encourages. It’s Wrong. Unacceptable. Unpresidential. We should all #SpeakUp #Speakout https://t.co/i9BSLWfHcA,2019-10-15 15:52:58,Twitter for iPhone,0,0
Make no mistake this President makes us less safe. Terrorist are a much bigger threat than migrants fleeing violence who have tried to present themselves for asylum.  https://t.co/vTF4d1YMPM,2019-10-15 15:36:56,Twitter for iPhone,0,0

Stop the lies. The President loves to start a fire then pretend like he is coming in to save the day. The bloodshed is on him and this Administration. That includes you Mr. VP. As women and children were killed he stood by and said let it continue. https://t.co/WDyM2kDslp,2019-10-15 04:31:29,Twitter for iPhone,1,8
God bless our US forces the Kurds &amp; our Homeland. Members of Congress should be briefed on the impact to the US terror threat given reports that terrorists are escaping in Syria due to the President’s betrayal of our allies. All while the President golfs &amp; says let it continue. https://t.co/OqERYRJkY0,2019-10-13 15:25:06,Twitter for iPhone,0,1

Can’t remember a President who had such disregard for the suffering of children. Anything to deter no matter the price. Forcing women and children to undergo these conditions by sending them off US soil doesn’t make this okay. https://t.co/OfvrXvl8c9,2019-10-13 04:53:18,Twitter for iPhone,5,7

Great day for federal workers but . . . President saying if he doesn’t get wall funding in the next three weeks he may shut down the government again. No compassion more threats. One word: sick. #TrumpShutDown,2019-01-25 19:39:34,Twitter for iPhone,5,18
McConnell being told by Trump what bills to bring to the floor and which not.

Great thread. Sunday on @CNNSotu I mentioned POTUS effectively moving towards a ban on asylum w/ proposal (I saw Admin turning asylum seekers away at POE Otay Mesa). Senate bill confirms - limits asylum &amp; endangers kids fleeing violence. Bad bill. POTUS misled Americans again. https://t.co/lwP2XJqmMq,2019-01-22 14:37:21,Twitter for iPhone,10,18
Mr President your #TrumpShutdown is allegedly about security but let’s be clear it is making us less safe. As a member of @HomelandDems let’s invest in airports seaports &amp; POE where the highest risks exist. End the shutdown and let’s give families the security of a paycheck. https://t.co/ECGF8CDipe,2019-01-21 15:39:38,Twitter for iPhone,3,4
