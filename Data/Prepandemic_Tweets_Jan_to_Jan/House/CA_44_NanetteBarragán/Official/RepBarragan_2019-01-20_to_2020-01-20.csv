The policy of separating children &amp; their parents causes devastating long term trauma. In some instances these children are also physically or sexually abused. It’s unconscionable.

To say states like California can’t impose more ambitious standards on emissions is a direct threat to our public health.

As someone who has visited our Southern border several times the only emergency is the crisis that was created by this administration’s cruel immigration policies that separate families &amp; put innocent children in cages.

When I think of climate change I don’t think in terms of green. I think in terms of black and brown. I don’t just see it as an environmental crisis I see systemic environmental racism that needs to be acknowledged and addressed. #ActonClimate #ClimateFriday @EnergyCommerce https://t.co/oJkILwOvLV,2019-02-08 15:37:56,Twitter for iPhone,108,259
