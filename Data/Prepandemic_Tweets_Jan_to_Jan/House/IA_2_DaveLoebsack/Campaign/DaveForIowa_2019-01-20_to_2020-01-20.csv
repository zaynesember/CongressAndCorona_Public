To the survivors of sexual assault please know that we stand with you and will support you in whatever way needed. The folks of Iowa’s 4th Congressional District deserve a Representative who will put the needs of the people before their hate-filled violent rhetoric. (2/2),2019-08-14 22:15:01,Twitter Web App,7,18
Once again Steve King has opened his mouth and once again he has become an embarrassment to our state. His misogynistic and racist comments do not represent the opinion and values of Iowans. (1/2)  https://t.co/ezzrXQxfrk,2019-08-14 22:15:01,Twitter Web App,10,29
