This impeachment has always been about one thing: Democrats’ utter dislike for @realDonaldTrump.  Speaker Pelosi sealed the deal when she declared this president is “impeached for life.” https://t.co/vWbW0OYRPd,2020-01-19 16:00:00,Twitter Media Studio,4954,14611
This impeachment has been a sham from day one.    The Senate will soon see these are the weakest articles of impeachment ever done.   House Democrats aren’t worried about the constitution. They’re worried about the 2020 election. https://t.co/94VZmLAAka,2020-01-18 15:30:00,Twitter Media Studio,5016,16113

Wrong again Chairman Nadler.   The Senate is not on trial. The weight of the weakest impeachment articles in American history falls on House Democrats.  The Senate will do their job. House Democrats failed at theirs. #ShamImpeachment https://t.co/wDS36CzBii,2020-01-17 14:13:49,Twitter Media Studio,10232,28332
Democrats' impeachment fixation comes at a dangerous cost.  A ban on fentanyl—which could save countless lives—expires next month. The Senate passed an extension on the ban but the House has yet to play its part.  We must act now. https://t.co/XLHEjHEMP4,2020-01-16 22:00:25,Twitter Web App,3819,8450

Don’t be fooled. This #ShamImpeachment is not a somber moment for Democrats.   If they were truly reverential they wouldn’t hand out commemorative pens.   They’re not reverential. They’re celebrating. https://t.co/Lz8nEcsV5w,2020-01-16 15:04:39,Twitter Media Studio,4009,11681

An innocent 92-year-old woman was murdered by a man—in the U.S. illegally—who was protected by NYC’s reckless policies.

Democrats claimed that impeachment was their “solemn duty” only to then use the articles as political leverage.   Their true intentions are clear: Democrats would rather take cheap shots against @realDonaldTrump in 2020 than pass legislation that serves the American people. https://t.co/WJwBsCDsew,2020-01-06 23:23:22,Twitter Media Studio,2399,6268
Where was Speaker Pelosi’s call for a war powers resolution when the Obama Administration unilaterally authorized drone strikes?   Don’t be mistaken.

Speaker Pelosi is haunted by the justice she denied the #ShamImpeachment articles that are now conveniently less “urgent” and the Senate trial she can’t control.   Not a good start to 2020 for House Democrats. https://t.co/TpyVdQxLNU,2020-01-05 21:36:53,Twitter Media Studio,3937,11207

Even more ridiculous than refusing to read #MuellerReport is Nadler’s claim @POTUS asserted privilege over McGahn’s testimony.

There seems to be some confusion about Vol 2 p 8. This isn’t a matter of legal interpretation; it’s reading comprehension. The report doesn’t say Congress should investigate obstruction now.
