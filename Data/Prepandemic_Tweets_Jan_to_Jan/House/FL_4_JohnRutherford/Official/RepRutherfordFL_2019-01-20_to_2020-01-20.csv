A treaty with ourselves is not a treaty. This is the right call by @realDonaldTrump and a strong response to Russia's aggression and dangerous disregard of our agreements. #INFTreaty https://t.co/ez13rbamnV,2019-02-01 17:40:43,Twitter Web Client,5,11

The wall technology and border agents all work together to achieve operational control of our border. If you remove one of these from the equation our borders become less secure our country less safe and our communities at a greater risk of drugs and crime.,2019-01-30 20:17:32,Twitter Web Client,3,19
I have never seen a drone put handcuffs on a criminal. We need more agents on the ground to make arrests and process individuals who enter our nation illegally.,2019-01-30 20:17:32,Twitter Web Client,4,19
Drones alert systems and other technology monitor our border and direct officers to illegal crossings when and where they occur. But it’s not enough.,2019-01-30 20:17:31,Twitter Web Client,0,6
Walls fencing and other physical impediments discourage illegal crossings. They force traffickers and criminals to spend significant time and effort digging tunnels and climbing offering law enforcement the time to detect individuals attempting to illegally cross the border.,2019-01-30 20:17:31,Twitter Web Client,4,12
As a former Sheriff I know that the best security plans require a multi-layered approach. This remains especially true for our southern border.,2019-01-30 20:17:31,Twitter Web Client,0,4

.@SpeakerPelosi sends Congress home on the day federal employees miss another paycheck. We should be staying in Washington working to find a solution to #EndTheShutdown.,2019-01-24 15:08:16,Twitter Web Client,7,32
.@realDonaldTrump has offered a compromise to end the shutdown. Instead of coming to the table @SpeakerPelosi is playing politics with the State of the Union. In the meantime our federal employees are set to miss their second paycheck. Enough!,2019-01-23 20:24:35,Twitter Web Client,16,54
