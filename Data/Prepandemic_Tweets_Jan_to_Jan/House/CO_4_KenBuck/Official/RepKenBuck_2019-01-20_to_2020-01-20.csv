Following repeated anti-Semitic remarks Democrats produced a resolution that was so watered-down it failed to address a very real problem.

This isn’t just a terrible policy it’s another attempt by Democrats to rewrite the underlying rules of the U.S. political system to steal our elections and skew those rules to only benefit themselves. #NOTForThePeople #HR1,2019-03-07 20:04:49,Twitter Web Client,68,173
#HR1 is #NOTForThePeople it is designed to take your taxpayer dollars and put them towards a special piggy bank to finance campaigns and political agendas of other candidates. This is a direct violation of every Americans’ Constitutional right to freedom of association.,2019-03-07 17:41:22,Twitter Web Client,51,85

If a child finds a firearm in a park and their parent surrenders the gun to a nearby police officer the transfer shouldn’t be criminalized!

We cannot keep adding to our national debt &amp; annual deficit. It is not only unsustainable but it is an unfair burden to place on future generations.

Next week Democrats will bring flawed #HR8 to the House floor. It WON’T stop criminals! It WILL criminalize a friend or step-parent loaning a gun to a victim of domestic violence so she can defend herself! #2ndAmendment,2019-02-22 17:27:49,Twitter for iPhone,16,51

"If illegal immigrants are going to get guns then we better tell ICE...so that ICE can arrest them and deport them and make this country safer."

The American people deserve better than this terrible deal. I will be voting NO on this bill that continues the pattern of reckless spending ties our ICE agents’ hands and fails to secure our southern border.,2019-02-15 01:48:41,Twitter for iPhone,20,71
It took Democrats less than TWO months to break their new rule requiring all Members have at least 72hrs to review bills. This 1169 page bill was filed at 12:05AM &amp; had a new division added at 1:20AM. We aren’t even getting 24hrs to review all the terrible things in this bill!,2019-02-15 01:10:02,Twitter for iPhone,19,31
How is this deal a compromise? It funds only 55 miles of fencing for $1.375 billion along a limited section of the border in exchange for preventing ICE from doing their jobs including deporting MS-13 gang members. All while continuing out of control federal spending.,2019-02-15 00:01:19,Twitter for iPhone,14,39
So Andrew McCabe and his cronies at the Justice Department conspired to invoke the 25th Amendment to target and remove @POTUS from office. This is nothing short of a coup by the FBI. It is absolutely disgraceful &amp; everyone involved deserves to be prosecuted to the fullest extent.,2019-02-14 21:25:28,Twitter Web Client,17,40
Here in Washington we have a duty to the Constitution and to the American people to declare &amp; oversee our country’s war efforts.

Today @JudiciaryGOP considered my amendment to #HR8 to 'Restore Individuals’ Second Amendment Rights.' This is about giving non-violent criminal offenders a second chance and restoring individuals' gun rights. Watch my remarks here: https://t.co/7DgCdQ0kGG,2019-02-13 19:13:52,Twitter Web Client,10,16
Our national debt just topped $22 trillion dollars for the first time. This is unfair to the American people. Even worse it is an unfair burden to place on our children. I believe both parties need to come together and find ways to limit and reduce spending.,2019-02-13 02:13:19,Twitter for iPhone,25,82
I am deeply saddened by the passing of my dear friend and colleague @RepWalterJones. He was a dedicated public servant to the people of North Carolina for over two decades and he will be missed by many. May God bless him and grant his family peace.,2019-02-11 02:43:53,Twitter for iPhone,4,12

.@HouseJudiciary is meeting today to discuss legislation to prevent mass violence. #HR8 claims to be a solution but solves nothing. It’s disingenuous to advocate for new laws that won’t work while refusing to enforce current laws that would prevent violent crimes.,2019-02-06 16:29:12,Twitter Web Client,1,10

As the situation in #Venezuela worsens we stand ready to act. The #Maduro regime's decision to violently crack down on its citizens must not be tolerated.

Glad I could join my colleagues to discuss a constitutional issue that needs to be addressed and I hope we can pass this War Powers Resolution in the House to reclaim our legislative authority over war-making activities in Congress for the sake of our men and women in uniform. https://t.co/JMQZJUlZmo,2019-01-30 20:11:57,Twitter Web Client,1,6
House Judiciary held its first hearing on #HR1 to “restore our democracy.” This bill does the exact opposite. Instead of protecting the integrity of our elections it encourages voter fraud &amp; undermines the American electoral system. Here are my remarks: https://t.co/B3BYbG9rJI,2019-01-29 22:33:44,Twitter Web Client,17,22
Our elections should be fair and free from all forms of manipulations. H.R. 1 on the other hand promotes voter fraud and uses taxpayer money to fund partisan political campaigns. @JudiciaryGOP,2019-01-29 17:13:15,Twitter Web Client,26,49
