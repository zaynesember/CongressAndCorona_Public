Furthermore the current occupant of the White House is afraid to push for gun safety because he like House and Senate Republicans is controlled by the NRA.,2019-09-03 19:57:25,Twitter Web App,5,19
Since taking back control of the House Democrats have passed common-sense gun safety legislation that has been sent on to the Senate only to see Moscow Mitch and Republicans like Cruz threaten public safety by not acting on these bills.,2019-09-03 19:57:23,Twitter Web App,4,15
Unlike Cruz these gun owners are not influenced by NRA money and understand that gun safety does not threaten their 2nd Amendment rights.,2019-09-03 19:57:23,Twitter Web App,3,12
Cruz is inaccurate when claims that guns safety legislation disarms law-abiding gun owners. Cruz employs this talking point to create fear amongst gun owners but it's not working. Polls show that over 80% of gun owners support some forms of gun safety legislation.,2019-09-03 19:57:23,Twitter Web App,3,10
Additionally he points to Chicago as an example of gun safety legislation not working. The fact is close to 60% of the guns recovered in Chicago by law enforcement actually come from states with more relaxed gun safety legislation.,2019-09-03 19:57:22,Twitter Web App,3,13
