For too long these lenders have preyed on low-income families and helped keep them trapped in a cycle of poverty. While these lenders might have their place we need STRONG rules governing their conduct and SEVERE punishments for breaking the rules. https://t.co/Ccb8k51lun,2019-02-07 18:43:35,Twitter Web Client,33,41

The majority of Americans are clear. They do not want a medieval #TrumpBorderWall; they want the smarter #bordersecurity plan offered by @HouseDemocrats because it’s a modern solution to a modern challenge. https://t.co/Un3NfwDyMS,2019-02-04 21:17:25,Twitter Web Client,4,12

I stand with our scientists. #Climatechange is real man-made and dangerous. @POTUS seems to be confused by the difference between ‘weather’ and ‘climate;’ maybe he should read his briefing memos. https://t.co/4zAOZ50Ofo,2019-02-01 18:03:55,Twitter for iPhone,13,24
I have the highest level of respect for the men and women of our intelligence services. Once again @POTUS disrespects their service while continuing his dangerous lies to the American people about our #nationalsecurity. https://t.co/N0nwIO5nQH,2019-01-30 22:03:19,Twitter Web Client,8,9

Since 2016 (and likely before) foreign governments have been working to undermine our democracy. Sadly President @realDonaldTrump has done NOTHING to prevent future attacks or punish past attacks. It’s time for Congress to step up. https://t.co/mmDbLdxTGo,2019-01-30 15:13:55,Twitter Web Client,3,6
Six years ago today a stray bullet ended the remarkable life of Hadiya Pendleton.

For a “Middle America” President his Cabinet is woefully out of touch w/ real American families.
