By expanding junk insurance plans the Trump Admin is undermining the insurance market risking destabilization and skyrocketing costs for those who depend on comprehensive coverage including those with pre-existing conditions.

"With his declaration of a national emergency at the southern border President Trump takes executive overreach to dizzying new heights. " I couldn't agree more. #FakeTrumpEmergency https://t.co/LSZiddY7y0 https://t.co/cK5FgBygj1,2019-02-16 22:01:53,Twitter for iPhone,0,0
As I see it going around Congress to build this wall is UNCONSTITUTIONAL.  I’m sure the courts will agree.,2019-02-16 02:03:00,Twitter for iPhone,4,10
The President previously signed funding bills that didn't include funding for his wall and funded other priorities. Money cannot and should not be reallocated without the express approval of Congress and the Appropriations Committee.,2019-02-16 02:03:00,Twitter for iPhone,4,11
The Constitution is very clear. Congress has the power of the purse not the President. This #FAKENationalEmergency is going around Congress &amp; the @AppropsDems @SenateApprops to waste money building an unnecessary wall along the southern border.,2019-02-16 02:03:00,Twitter for iPhone,8,17
The reality of the #FakeTrumpEmergency? It makes America less safe by stealing billions from crucial military construction projects that ensure our troops have the essential training readiness &amp; quality of life necessary to do their jobs effectively.,2019-02-15 19:27:29,Twitter for iPhone,4,18
I stand with @SpeakerPelosi &amp; @SenSchumer to defend ourConstitution. This “national emergency” scam violates our system of checks &amp; balances and undermines our Founders’ vision for our country. QT: https://t.co/GcZXe5bgxC,2019-02-15 18:55:55,Twitter for iPhone,4,19
The president's insistence on building a wall dragged us through the longest shutdown in history. Now he wants to declare a #NationalEmergency that will reallocate resources from other places to fund it including from #PuertoRico's aid funds. This is absurd and disgusting.,2019-02-15 05:11:34,Twitter for iPhone,2,10
Many of my constituents in #TheBronx have benefited from their services and as Chairman of the @AppropsDems CJS subcommittee funding this agency is one of my top priorities.,2019-02-14 03:01:12,Twitter for iPhone,0,2

Safety net hospitals in #TheBronx rely on #MedicaidDSH funds to provide low-income and uninsured patients with high-quality healthcare services. Congress must act soon to prevent cuts that will severely impact our most under-served populations urban and rural alike. @GNYHA,2019-02-10 20:48:02,Twitter for iPhone,22,36

Last night's speech was not the unifying message that the President promised. Just many of the same empty statements we’ve heard before. Actions speak louder than words &amp; his policies contradict what he supposedly stands for and wants to work on: https://t.co/2J1roNqxBh #SOTU https://t.co/gpek5Jui14,2019-02-06 16:17:48,Twitter for iPhone,0,3
The president said this would be a unifying speech but continues to divide our nation with immigrant fear mongering. We do not want open borders we want to protect our border but a useless wall is not the answer. #SOTU,2019-02-06 02:51:45,Twitter for iPhone,21,77
Glad to hear full receivership wasn't part of the deal between @HUDgov @NYCHA &amp; @NYCMayor.I welcome this commitment to provide more funds &amp; oversee their progress towards a better @NYCHA.

@HouseDemocrats have passed yet another bill to reopen the government &amp; #EndTheShutdown. Over 800k federal employees have been held hostage &amp; not gotten paid for more than a month because of the #TrumpShutown.
