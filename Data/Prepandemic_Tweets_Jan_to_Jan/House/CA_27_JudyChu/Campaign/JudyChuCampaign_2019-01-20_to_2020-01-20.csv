I was proud to join @UNITEHERE11 to fight for airline catering workers who can't wait to access health care or overdue raises while @AmericanAir posts record profits.

I stand with the Kaiser workers!  So many came out this weekend to express their voices for a higher quality of life in which they can support their families. Kaiser workers took such good care of my parents in their last years. I want to make sure we take care of them.,2019-09-04 02:43:36,Twitter for iPhone,0,3
