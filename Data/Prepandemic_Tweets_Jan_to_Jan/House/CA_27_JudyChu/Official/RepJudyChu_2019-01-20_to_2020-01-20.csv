With more women in Congress than ever we're wearing suffragette white to the #SOTU to remind Trump that we will not let our hard-earned rights be rolled back or undermined. https://t.co/uixFX7W5Bh,2019-02-05 23:32:12,TweetDeck,179,623
I support this goal wholeheartedly but first Trump &amp; Pence will have to backtrack on their past policies. We need better sex education and access to prevention to achieve this goal. That also means continuing to support @PPFA and the ACA. https://t.co/kE7aEZBIUX,2019-02-05 18:00:17,TweetDeck,5,40
Happy Lunar New to the millions in the US and around the world who are celebrating today. As we welcome the Year of the Pig -   a symbol of wealth compassion diligence and generosity - let's also celebrate the rich heritage of AAPIs &amp; their many contributions to our country. https://t.co/rKNZLtDApJ,2019-02-05 16:00:13,TweetDeck,15,63
There is a real opioid crisis in our country but by focusing on his wall Donald Trump is ignoring it. My guest to tonight's #SOTU @RyanForRecovery has an op-ed in today's @USATODAY urging Trump to drop the xenophobic distraction &amp; focus on real causes https://t.co/qR7QELPsBk,2019-02-05 14:22:59,TweetDeck,50,118
My #SOTU guest will be recovery advocate Ryan Hampton. After watching a friend die in a sober living home Ryan &amp; I worked on a new law to help others struggling w/ addiction. He'll join me to urge Trump to focus on the real causes of the opioid epidemic not a xenophobic wall https://t.co/PW2IWWYgz1,2019-02-04 18:00:14,Twitter Web Client,14,52

This is great. I was a math major until I saw a flyer for my first Asian American studies course. Learning about our history like the Chinese Exclusion Act the harm of stereotypes and the need for social services put me on a path I never anticipated. https://t.co/4Gcov2Fkke,2019-02-01 21:34:02,TweetDeck,22,90
You're describing asylum seekers with a legal right to be here. The crisis is that you keep imprisoning them retraumatizing them and separating them from loved ones. https://t.co/COaRsWzklX,2019-02-01 20:00:32,TweetDeck,31,80
Currently on the House floor: A resolution that says prolonged shutdowns cause harm to the economy &amp; families and should not be used as a negotiating tactic.   There shouldn't be a single member voting against this. We don't govern by hostage taking.,2019-01-30 17:31:52,TweetDeck,55,151
Lily Ledbetter fearlessly fought to reopen the courtroom doors for women who were paid less than men. But we shouldn’t have to sue for equal pay. Today we are introducing the #PaycheckFairness Act to close the wage gap that leaves women earning less for the same work. https://t.co/BgfOw4enKb,2019-01-30 14:16:23,Twitter for iPhone,92,256
My thoughts are with @JussieSmollett and the millions of others who know the pain of being attacked - either physically or verbally - by somebody who is angered by their race religion or orientation.

What would happen to women and women's health if the ACA went away? That was my question in today's @WaysMeansCmte hearing on preexisting conditions. The answer is a return to the days where just being a woman meant having to pay more for insurance. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/8OEFfBmLip,2019-01-29 20:54:06,Twitter for iPhone,7,18
Words NOT USED in @ODNIgov statement to Congress on "national security threats facing our nation":  Border Immigrant Refugee  Immigration is not a threat. There is no border crisis.

On the same day the President smugly called for more global warming his intelligence chief says that more global warming threatens our infrastructure health and safety.

A refugee from Somalia a country included in Trump's bigoted Muslim Ban Rep. @Ilhan Omar is a living example of how the prejudice of this ban only holds our country back.

Thanks to the pointless #TrumpShutdown which ended when he accepted the offer we had made since day 1 the US economy lost $8 BILLION this quarter. This is according to the nonpartisan CBO. What a waste. Shutdowns are not policy making tools. https://t.co/z0fm0yh1H2,2019-01-28 18:44:02,TweetDeck,17,32

On behalf of the 800000 federal workers millions of contractors and their families &amp; communities I'm so relieved Trump has agreed to back down and reopen the government. Taking hostages is no way to govern. Now it's time to reach a  deal that ends governing by crisis,2019-01-25 19:46:09,TweetDeck,27,102
Commerce Sec. Ross doesn't know why furloughed workers needed to go to food banks. So I went for myself. People lined up in the rain for help with food groceries &amp; utilities. Others like my constituents have to sacrifice medical care or car repairs to get by. #EndTheShutdown! https://t.co/Hg72FUVjuu,2019-01-25 19:14:57,TweetDeck,10,49
This is the air traffic above the Western US right now. Thanks to the #TrumpShutdown air traffic controllers are furloughed and the safety of our skies is at risk.

Volunteering at @WCKitchen today I met seasoned veterans of the FBI and DOJ. They’re the ones who keep our courts functioning and our judicial system working.

A line of federal workers waiting in the rain for help with food and other essentials at @WCKitchen. There are hundreds here.

I’m at the Food kitchen set up by @chefjoseandres just feet from the White House. In addition to serving over 11000 meals yesterday alone they are providing groceries diapers tampons pet food and help with utilities.

You should speak to more workers like my constituent Eric who works on maritime security issues. He can't skip his son's tuition payments so he's cutting back on other expenses to "weather the storm." His colleagues are using their savings or taking out loans. #EndTheShutdown! https://t.co/ZafXp1qATU,2019-01-24 14:44:16,TweetDeck,8,41
Just voted again to reopen the government. No workers should suffer while we debate real border security that actually works. I hope the Senate does the same soon. #EndTheShutdown,2019-01-23 20:28:19,Twitter for iPhone,61,209
Thanks to laws that restrict access to abortion 1 in 3 women of repro age - mostly poorer women of color - could be condemned to a pre-Roe existence.

Transgender Americans have served our country for years in the military. They are brave talented capable and valued.
