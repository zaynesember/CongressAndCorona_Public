If @USDA's proposed SNAP cuts stand:  11% of Nevadans on SNAP will lose their benefits.  1300 NV low-income students will immediately lose access to free school lunches.  Retailers will lose an estimated $9 million monthly from loss of revenue.  These cuts are bad for everyone. https://t.co/cZbIL8L8go,2019-10-17 01:00:00,TweetDeck,10,35
.@RepKimSchrier nails it. If these cuts to SNAP stand over one million children will lose access to school meals.  Kids from low-income families getting free school lunches are not the enemy but that’s what this cruel policy indicates. https://t.co/a3NCHf3rHN,2019-10-17 00:00:00,TweetDeck,8,10

.@USDA wants to slash SNAP benefits for millions of low-income families.   On average a family of four receiving SNAP benefits has an annual income between $33000 - $51000.

Nevada is ground-zero for predatory for-profit school closures. Dozens of NV #4profit schools have gone under in the last decade.   It has saddled our students with debt &amp; incomplete educations.

Only 51% of @ClarkCountySch graduates go on to pursue higher education.

There are a number of ways to prevent and reduce opioid abuse addiction and death. The problem is that our communities--like southern Nevada and our rural communities—just don’t have the resources or the funding to implement the solutions that we know work.,2019-08-15 19:45:48,Twitter for iPhone,0,2
Opioid addiction is hitting our veteran population harder than any other and it’s largely because of how our country has decided to treat them--by throwing prescription painkiller after prescription painkiller at them rather than giving them comprehensive medical treatment.,2019-08-15 19:44:37,Twitter for iPhone,4,12
At least one Nevadan loses their life to opioids every day &amp; that’s especially painful b/c we know it’s preventable. And for no group of people is that more true than for our veterans.,2019-08-15 19:44:00,Twitter for iPhone,1,2

84 years ago today the Social Security Act was signed into law to give Americans much-needed stability and security. Today without social security 2 in 5 older Americans would be living in poverty.   We have to protect Social Security. #SocSec84.,2019-08-14 21:45:00,TweetDeck,4,17
Places of worship should be a refuge for communities. But last week Rabbi Hundley had to share the unimaginable w/his congregation that their synagogue was the target of an antisemitic terrorist attack.

The teacher shortage in @ClarkCountySch is real. Teachers are underpaid and overworked and it falls on us to do something about it and make teaching an actual priority.

Teachers shouldn’t need to “get creative” to pay for school supplies. A $250 school supply tax deduction just isn’t enough for teachers who are already underpaid.   It’s simple: We need to pass legislation to help our teachers. https://t.co/HtQ0TNBzdw,2019-08-11 19:45:00,TweetDeck,7,19
