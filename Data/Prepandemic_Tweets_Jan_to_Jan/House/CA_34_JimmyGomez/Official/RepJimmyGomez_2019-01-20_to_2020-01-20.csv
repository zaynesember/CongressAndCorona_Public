#RepresentationMatters because it's empowering for children to see people who look like them on 🎥 and 📺.  This is hardly the case for Latino children who are often mis- and underrepresented.

In 2010 750000 Latinos weren’t counted in the census including 400000 children under 5.

18k.  That's how many people @WhiteHouse will allow to seek refuge in our country. To put that number in perspective @STAPLESCenter holds 21k. @realDonaldTrump's ignorance is endangering the lives of those in search of a better life.

The #FakeTrumpEmergency takes $3.6 billion AWAY from military families and construction projects so @realDonaldTrump can get his wall.

#UkraineScandal gets more egregious w/ every passing day.

Threatening to fire top @NOAA officials for going along with @realDonaldTrump’s mistake on Alabama is:  ❌ Irresponsible ❌ Reckless ❌ Ignorant  These aren’t the actions of an American president.

Let’s be clear about this:  1️⃣ White supremacy is NOT mental illness.  2️⃣ The overwhelming majority of people with mental illness are NOT violent.  3️⃣ Those who live with mental illness are FAR more likely to be victims of violent crime.  4️⃣ WHITE SUPREMACY IS NOT MENTAL ILLNESS. https://t.co/RTcZhLUL8U,2019-08-05 18:14:10,Twitter for iPhone,17,48
A few questions:  Why did @realDonaldTrump fail to mention the urgent need for universal background checks?  Why does he think video games pose a greater risk than a lack of sensible gun laws?

Clearly racism inside the @WhiteHouse extends beyond the Oval Office.

Since the #Columbine shooting 20 years ago 223k students have been exposed to gun violence at school.  We cannot let this be the new normal.

California has been a national leader on #PaidFamilyLeave since 2002.  It’s important to learn from our state’s experience — and the expertise of the groups who joined me at today’s #PaidFamilyLeaveRoundtable — as we begin the push for a national paid family leave law. https://t.co/sxYtHpFbDk,2019-04-19 00:09:40,Twitter for iPhone,11,24
My take on the #MuellerReport: https://t.co/F5FfdwBtnz  As my team &amp; I analyze Mueller’s findings I urge people to read the report &amp; reach their own conclusions.  Make no mistake: Congress will continue to investigate allegations of misconduct &amp; hold the @WhiteHouse accountable. https://t.co/XW66BXBO96,2019-04-18 20:51:40,Twitter for iPhone,5,17

THIS is what REAL oversight looks like.  Stephen Miller has been on my radar since the moment I was sworn in to office.

If I wanted to watch a @realDonaldTrump loyalist “interpret” the #MuellerReport I’d turn on @FoxNews.  Yeah no thanks.  Attorney General Barr needs to:  ✔️ #ReleaseTheReport in its entirety  ✔️ Let Americans make up their own minds  ✔️ Put the people before the president https://t.co/ouIh9tvJHV,2019-04-17 22:08:11,Twitter for iPhone,9,37

If there’s anything we’ve learned from this administration it’s that they can’t or won’t answer questions from Members of Congress w/ a “D” after their name.

The unconstitutional #MuslimBan does not – and never will – have a place in our country.

I wonder what the final straw was for @SecNielsen.

Today’s @WaysMeansCmte hearing is on Trump’s 2020 Budget Proposal with Secretary Mnuchin...Do they really want to defend over $1 trillion in cuts to Medicare Medicaid and other programs? https://t.co/dpM5COW0ig,2019-03-14 13:11:35,Twitter for iPhone,13,18
There are over $1 TRILLION in proposed cuts in #TrumpBudget that will continue to line the pockets of the wealthy and cripple America's #WorkingFamilies.  @HouseDemocrats will reject this harmful budget and any other budget proposal that is not #ForThePeople. https://t.co/KJPXUG719V,2019-03-13 23:46:31,Twitter Web Client,4,10

Legendary @TeamUSA star @Carl_Lewis and @Nike swung by my #DC office where we talked about the importance of physical activity and the overwhelming benefits it has to keeping a healthy mind &amp; body.

I fly between Los Angeles and Washington every week twice a week — and I’ll tell you I would NOT want to fly on a Boeing 737 MAX 8 right now.  So why should anybody else have to?

I don’t trust the word of ANYONE who is — or was — in Trump’s inner circle.  The only thing that matters is EVIDENCE of wrongdoing — and Michael Cohen brought that before the @OversightDems.

Good morning from #SXSW!  At @EUintheUS’s breakfast I reiterated the importance of protecting consumer data — ESPECIALLY when it comes to @Amazon Rekognition.

I’m with you @RepCummings.  @WhiteHouse’s refusal to provide @OversightDems info on security clearance abuses is DEEPLY troubling.

Clearly @OversightDems are committed to getting the facts from @realDonaldTrump about his financial engagements.  Here's my question:  Why isn't @HouseGOP?

Why did Jared Kushner fail his background check and — more importantly — why was he STILL granted a security clearance?   Is the West Wing compromised by someone who shouldn’t have a security clearance in the first place?   @OversightDems will get to the bottom of this. https://t.co/8UFUKOQ5t0,2019-03-02 01:07:18,Twitter for iPhone,88,382
I’d like to thank the 33 organizations who joined my #2020Census call with @NALEO.

The #CohenHearing provided the public with a new insider's perspective on how @realDonaldTrump thinks and operates.

According to Michael Cohen Trump won't release his #TaxReturns because he's afraid the scrutiny of them will lead to him facing "taxable consequences and penalties."   My other committee @WaysMeansCmte has the power to obtain Trump's tax returns.   I think it's time we did so. https://t.co/0NVDrQu5N4,2019-02-27 23:53:37,Twitter Web Client,1181,3762

306 days have passed since the start of the #FamilySeparationCrisis.  Thousands of kids remain separated from their parents -- some of whom have been lost in the system. This is choosing anything BUT “greatness.” #SOTU,2019-02-06 02:16:42,Twitter Web Client,46,91
#IncomeInequality #ClimateChange skyrocketing health care costs aging infrastructure and a broken immigration system — these are some of the biggest issues facing America.

Trayvon Martin would have turned 24 today.  His birthday is a reminder to us that far too many black lives are unjustifiably cut short in America.

2) Sandra’s story isn’t just my family’s story but also the story of many of my constituents in #CA34 California &amp; across the US.  It’s a story that needs to be heard.

1) Why did I invite Sandra Diaz as my #SOTU guest?  Her story — one of an undocumented immigrant who worked in the laundry room of Trump’s Bedminster golf club — reminds me of my mom.

This was @realDonaldTrump’s plan to “fix” the border crisis:  ❌ Separate families  ❌ Keep children in warehouses  ❌ Deport parents  ❌ Deny medical care &amp; compassion  They’re not helping secure our borders they’re creating a humanitarian crisis at the border. #OurHispanicSOTU https://t.co/5o6kJhigz4,2019-02-05 16:47:19,Twitter for iPhone,25,44

Trump didn’t care that the #TrumpShutdown:  ❌ Stole paychecks from 800k federal workers ❌ Disrupted air travel for MILLIONS ❌ Cost our economy BILLIONS ❌ Forced Americans to food lines  He cared more about looking good than doing good.
