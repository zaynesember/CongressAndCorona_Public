Tonight @POTUS reminded us that extraordinary bipartisan accomplishments are possible and I couldn't agree more. My first month in office has proven there are many issues that bring us together as Americans and I know we can bring real tangible change to Washington. https://t.co/nvvF7FTXPe,2019-02-06 04:00:31,Twitter Web Client,3,9

Met @SecWilkie at the White House to examine how we can improve veteran care. By modernizing the appeals process utilizing electronic records and expanding healthcare access we can give our veterans the care and treatment they deserve. https://t.co/vZjOUjuZUj,2019-02-05 21:52:09,Twitter for iPhone,0,6
We must have great schools to have a successful community &amp; public schools are a beacon in bringing businesses to Collin County.

As border security negotiations get underway I stopped by @NBCDFW to discuss our options moving forward. As a Marine I served at the US - Mexico border.

Introduced legislation w/ Rep. @Malinowski to limit US troop reduction in Syria. I served in Iraq where we lived the creed “leave no one behind” - This applies to Americans fighting overseas as well as those fighting with us for the cause.
