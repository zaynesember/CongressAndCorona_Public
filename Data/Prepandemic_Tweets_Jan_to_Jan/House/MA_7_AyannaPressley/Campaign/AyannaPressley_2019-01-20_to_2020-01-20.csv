So many who have labored in love fought for justice and shook the table have been relegated a footnote in history.  Not anymore.

Last week I visited @EMKInstitute BYOC exhibit. I turned to my team &amp; said ‘This is real. We’re in Congress.’  It felt surreal to have a dedicated chair crafted by a local artist bearing my name there. https://t.co/LIbng6zsmX,2019-11-30 22:16:58,Twitter for iPhone,32,509
Her example has been a constant source of strength and inspiration. My current DC office was her 1st Congressional office and I often wonder about where she sat what she grappled with if she stood and looked out this window #ShirleyChisholm https://t.co/Vrbxhhg1HQ,2019-11-30 22:16:53,Twitter for iPhone,27,499

The same 5 or 10 names are mentioned each time all worthy. OutKast only comes up in Atlanta but the South is usually overlooked in these debates East &amp; West Coast dominate &amp; usually not 1 female MC is named.

Too often those on the frontlines of the fight for economic racial and social justice have been relegated to the footnotes of history.  Not in this movement.
