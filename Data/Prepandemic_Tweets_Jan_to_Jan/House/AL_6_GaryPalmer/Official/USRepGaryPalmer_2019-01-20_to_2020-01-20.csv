After 28 days Speaker Pelosi has transmitted the articles of impeachment to the Senate. The Democrats' #ShamImpeachment case is clearly not urgent and has clearly been partisan and political from the start.   https://t.co/XP4G358jj5,2020-01-15 21:50:00,TweetDeck,20,29

It should now be clear to #Iran that the US will defend its own. @POTUS has learned from others' mistakes &amp; made clear we will respond to threats against US citizens.

From the beginning of this #ShamImpeachment process against POTUS there has been no evidence of treason bribery or other high crimes or misdemeanors.

None of this is about evidence or fairness but about determination to remove a president Democrats do not like. This is not how you impeach a president and this is certainly not justice.  #ShamImpeachment,2019-12-10 21:27:57,Twitter Web App,10,38
Democrats resolved on #Impeachment on POTUS's inauguration day. Rep. Al Green even said today “If the Senate does not convict that does not mean it’s over” and then suggested the House could pursue impeachment again on other grounds if the Senate didn't vote to remove POTUS.,2019-12-10 21:27:57,Twitter Web App,8,28
House Democrats have now unveiled #ArticlesOfImpeachment against President Trump despite continued lack of evidence. This is an embarrassing day for the House of Representatives and just one more phase in what has been a blatant miscarriage of justice from the start.,2019-12-10 21:27:57,Twitter Web App,90,292

I’m opposing #HR1 because it: 🔘Undermines free &amp; fair elections 🔘Funds campaigns w/ taxpayer $$ 🔘Hinders states from overseeing voter laws 🔘Doesn’t guard against or punish voter fraud #HR1 benefits politicians not the people #NOTforthePeopleAct ➡ https://t.co/nlLaWCbjap,2019-03-06 22:30:45,Twitter Web Client,4,14

I'm speaking on the House floor today to ask for unanimous consent on HR 962 which seeks to protect newborn children from infanticide. This should be an easy "yes" vote. The right to life is fundamental to our country's values. #BornAliveAct https://t.co/nFea8DbppI,2019-02-26 20:09:45,Twitter Web Client,53,186

I could not in good conscience support HJRes31 because it increases spending in areas unrelated to national security when thousands are dying from drugs coming across our Southern border &amp; others are suffering injuries &amp; death at the hands of people who came here illegally.,2019-02-15 02:10:04,Twitter for iPhone,9,47
Today the House passed my bill the SAID Act. It would provide transparency &amp; accountability where there is currently no uniform standard for recordkeeping within federal agencies.

Honored to attend the State of the Union last night. The President's call for unity was timely: "We must choose between greatness or gridlock results or resistance vision or vengeance incredible progress or pointless destruction. Tonight I ask you to choose greatness." #SOTU https://t.co/XZaYIPIiYt,2019-02-06 15:09:46,Twitter Web Client,4,20

I‘m glad POTUS has found a temporary solution to reopen the govt. The shutdown has put many in a difficult position &amp; this will be a necessary relief. In the next 3 weeks I hope we can put partisanship aside &amp; reach a deal that will keep the govt open AND ensure a secure border.,2019-01-25 21:47:18,Twitter for iPhone,4,33
As we celebrate MLK Jr.’s legacy today we continue to look toward the completion of his vision expressed in his “I Have A Dream” speech. We can also reflect on his inspiring leadership through quotes like this:   “A man who won’t die for something is not fit to live.” #MLKDay https://t.co/8A7ZFkPcfC,2019-01-21 14:55:35,Twitter for iPhone,4,10
