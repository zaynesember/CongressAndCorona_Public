In light of the new documents handed over by Lev Parnas I am even more troubled by the President’s campaign to smear and intimidate Ambassador Yovanovitch than I was during her hearing in November.

That’s why I’ve introduced H.R. 5599 the Fulfilling the Promise of the Housing Trust Fund Act with Rep. Lacy Clay @RepBlumenauer @RepPerlmutter to revitalize the Housing Trust Fund. Every family in America should have a safe affordable place to live. https://t.co/rmJQ88Fegq,2020-01-15 14:38:18,Twitter Web App,5,23
At the height of the financial crisis in 2008 Congress established the Housing Trust Fund to fund more construction of affordable housing but its scale has been far inadequate to the need. Expanding this critical tool is an economic and moral imperative.,2020-01-15 14:37:09,Twitter Web App,4,20
However only building market rate housing won’t ease the burden for those who can barely pay rent or cannot afford a home at all.   We need to match that market rate construction with significant investments in affordable housing.,2020-01-15 14:35:33,Twitter Web App,1,20
Housing costs across the nation are skyrocketing. For a decade new home construction simply hasn’t kept pace with demand and now the nation’s housing market is missing millions of homes.

@nytimes I’m glad Chair Powell and the Fed are taking their full employment mandate seriously and recognize that American workers still haven’t gotten the raise they deserve. https://t.co/aoGngc4xWT,2019-12-14 18:44:19,Twitter Web App,10,25
@nytimes We’re winning the argument: Unemployment has continued to decline far below what experts had targeted and we still haven’t reached full employment.   As Chair Powell told me in June “Wages are missing ten years of growth.” https://t.co/pLTDnb6DOO,2019-12-14 18:42:01,Twitter Web App,9,24
@nytimes The Fed’s mandate is “full employment.” But what does that mean?  To experts? A target unemployment rate.  To me it means anyone who wants a job has one so employers have to raise wages to attract workers. That’s why I’ve asked the Fed Chair: “When does America get a raise?” https://t.co/fyfzKCryuy,2019-12-14 18:39:05,Twitter Web App,12,27
@nytimes Before incomes fully recovered experts declared victory:  "As Fed officials and economists declared that the economy was at or near full employment some predicted that job gains would soon slow and wages would rise much more quickly.

The bottom line: this bill is a responsible solution that will reduce drug prices for thousands of Washingtonians improve Medicare coverage and make smart investments to improve the health of all Americans. I'm proud we passed  #HR3 out of the House today. (14/14),2019-12-12 21:06:12,Twitter Web App,1,25
Lastly the bill uses these savings to invest in biomedical research to find cures for the most devastating diseases. And it makes investments to respond to some of our most urgent health issues: health worker shortage maternal mortality crisis and opioid epidemic. #HR3 (13/14) https://t.co/l8YsFFxv7x,2019-12-12 21:03:32,Twitter Web App,1,17
The savings from lower Medicare drug spending are so large that #HR3 also expands Medicare to cover dental vision and hearing care for all beneficiaries. These are critical elements of total health care and including them in Medicare is a great achievement. (12/14) https://t.co/bj73IXNcuF,2019-12-12 21:01:51,Twitter Web App,2,12
For Medicare the savings are plowed back into improved benefits for seniors. For Medicare beneficiaries the bill creates a limit on out-of-pocket spending and adds new subsidies for low-income seniors. #HR3 (11/14) https://t.co/Fg4e8Ai1xb,2019-12-12 21:00:23,Twitter Web App,3,14
These lower prices will be available to both Medicare beneficiaries and individuals with private insurance. This will translate into lower premiums and lower cost sharing for people with private insurance. #HR3 (10/14),2019-12-12 20:57:13,Twitter Web App,3,16
The bill also imposes financial penalties on drug companies that dramatically hike their prices. To give context the average annual cost of prescription drugs rose nearly 58% between 2012 and 2017. That number should concern all of us. #HR3 (9/14),2019-12-12 20:55:45,Twitter Web App,2,14
Now onto the details:   This bill requires HHS to negotiate prices for 50-250 drugs per year (drugmakers will face stiff financial penalties if they refuse to negotiate). Budget experts say the lower prices will reduce fed spending by $456 billion over the 2020s. #HR3 (8/14),2019-12-12 20:54:53,Twitter Web App,2,14
For years my colleagues—including my friend the late Elijah Cummings—worked to make drug price negotiation a reality. Many of these ideas inspired the bill we passed today #HR3 which is why it is formally named the Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act (7/14),2019-12-12 20:53:02,Twitter Web App,1,24
Medicare which provides health coverage to 60 million Americans lacks the power to negotiate drug prices. Almost $1 of every $5 spent in Medicare now goes to prescription drugs and the total cost over the next decade will be in the trillions of dollars. #HR3 (6/14),2019-12-12 20:51:25,Twitter Web App,3,18
Parts of our government already negotiate drug prices. The VA is allowed to negotiate prices for the drugs it buys for veterans and drug companies are required to provide price discounts to Medicaid. As a result the VA and Medicaid pay much lower drug prices. #HR3 (5/14),2019-12-12 20:49:58,Twitter Web App,2,13
These problems don’t happen in other countries. The reason prescription drugs are cheaper abroad than in the U.S. is because those governments take a more active role in negotiating lower prices. #HR3 (4/14) https://t.co/YwlOZdxMLv,2019-12-12 20:48:48,Twitter Web App,5,19
I also hear from constituents who work in the health care industry and see firsthand the impacts of our broken prescription drug market. I received this letter last month from Gordon from Tumwater and found it particularly moving #HR3 (3/14) https://t.co/uRINbmC3h2,2019-12-12 20:46:57,Twitter Web App,2,16
I constantly hear from Washingtonians who are outraged about drug prices in America. I’m especially affected by those reliant on a medicine whose price suddenly skyrockets and constituents who ration medications or forego treatment altogether because of costs. #HR3 (2/14) https://t.co/aBvzDeYzhI,2019-12-12 20:44:54,Twitter Web App,1,15
Today is a historic day in the House. We passed #HR3 a bill that drives down prescription drug costs and uses $500B in Medicare savings to expand benefits for seniors.  Before I get into the details of the bill let me explain what these reforms mean to me: (1/14) https://t.co/nVm60PXoEF,2019-12-12 20:41:37,Twitter Web App,28,141

We need to #EndTheShutdown. I am relieved that the Senate Majority Leader and President Trump have finally agreed to do that. I hope everyone learned from this disaster that government funding bills are not the way to advance controversial policies. https://t.co/ihDnwxC0Uu,2019-01-25 22:01:00,TweetDeck,3,18
While I wish this agreement hadn’t taken 35 days and harmed hundreds of thousands of people as well as our economy I am encouraged by this bipartisan agreement. It is a step in the right direction. https://t.co/FiW1e1ahGw,2019-01-25 21:10:00,TweetDeck,4,17
I support the plan to reopen the government for 3 weeks without any additional changes to spending levels. Let’s reopen the government and focus on agreeing to long-term funding commitments in order to provide financial certainty and security to federal workers and our economy.,2019-01-25 20:57:00,TweetDeck,4,46

16000 federal workers in WA state haven't gotten their paychecks because of the #TrumpShutdown. I'm grateful for today's action by @GovInslee and @ESDwaWorks and for the outpouring of support from communities and businesses in the South Sound to help our neighbors. https://t.co/ZsBr8iSvTu,2019-01-25 00:28:00,TweetDeck,14,35
The government shutdown is making us less safe.   "One overriding fact is clear when you listen to FBI agents: financial security is national security."   It’s time to #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/x3P4enThHK,2019-01-24 20:15:00,TweetDeck,5,17

The strength of our military comes from recruiting the best and brightest across the nation not from restricting service on the basis of race sex sexual orientation or gender identity. You can count on me to fight the discriminatory #TransMilitaryBan at every turn. https://t.co/oY2Bl8ns5r,2019-01-23 01:10:00,TweetDeck,15,58
