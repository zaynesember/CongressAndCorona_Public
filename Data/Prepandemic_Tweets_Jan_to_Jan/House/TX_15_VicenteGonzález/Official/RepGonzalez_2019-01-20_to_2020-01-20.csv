Congress must reassert its vested powers and uphold its duty to check the power of the Executive and provide oversight when a sitting President attempts to circumvent the power of the purse via a national emergency declaration.,2019-02-28 21:20:12,Twitter Web Client,1,1
Proud to join the bipartisan effort led by @RepTomReed/@RepJoshG to claw back power from the Executive Branch. By amending the National Emergencies Act Congress will have to approve emergency declarations within 60 days – similar to the War Powers Act. https://t.co/EYJzfGKVcw,2019-02-28 21:20:12,Twitter Web Client,2,3

The 15th District of Texas which is located on the U.S.-Mexico Border does not need a border wall to enhance safety. We needs smart practical border security solutions.

It is critical that Congress do everything in its power to protect federal employees – that includes the federal courts.

If @realDonaldTrump had spoken to more of those who work on the frontlines when he visited TX he might have gained a wider perspective of the actual security needs on the US-MX Border.

So far the government shutdown is costing the U.S. economy about $26 billion—according the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) that amount is almost equal to the average cost of damage from a hurricane. We must come together to reopen the government. #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/oYZErrQphm,2019-01-24 15:47:21,Twitter Web Client,3,3
