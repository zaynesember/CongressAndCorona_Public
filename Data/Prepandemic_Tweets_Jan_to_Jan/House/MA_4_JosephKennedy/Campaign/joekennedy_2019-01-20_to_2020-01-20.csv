There was a young president who looked up at the moon half a century ago and said: “let’s go there.”   We did that—with less technology than we have in an iPhone today.

And it's worth pointing out that Congressional Republicans aren't objecting to this attempt to take coverage away; they only object before elections when they might have to take responsibility for their position.

We can't let this get buried in the news: The Trump admin is trying to gut the entire ACA - Medicaid expansion required coverage for pre-existing conditions pregnancy Rx drugs &amp; more.

Attorney General William Barr mislead Congress and the American people to protect Donald Trump.  It's long past time to hold this administration accountable for their contempt for truth and justice. William Barr should resign today.  https://t.co/Tc0iXd2zAO,2019-05-01 22:01:19,Twitter Web Client,24,111
The GOP tax swindle funneled trillions up to the richest 1%. Trump’s budget would force the most vulnerable to pay for it by slashing Medicare Medicaid &amp; Social Security.  There’s the GOP plan plain as can be: Give to the rich. Take from everyone else. https://t.co/sNyW3w4lFe,2019-04-25 17:07:14,Twitter Web Client,17,43

If we’re going to restore the American people’s faith in our institutions &amp; the rule of law Barr must make the entire report public and Special Counsel Mueller must testify before Congress.

Yesterday Attorney General William Barr released a redacted version of the Mueller Report that describes at least ten episodes in which Donald Trump tried to short-circuit our justice system.   And that’s just in the part we can see.,2019-04-19 19:30:42,Twitter Web Client,18,106

Last Friday Donald Trump's hateful ban on transgender troops took effect. Make no mistake: this is a grim moment in our nation's history. The ban is a cynical policy designed to divide Americans by bringing out our very worst.,2019-04-16 13:26:04,Twitter Web Client,53,262

If we're going to work toward a better world for all people where appreciating women is more than an annual novelty then it's time to step up. Because it's the least we can do for the women in our lives.,2019-03-08 16:50:44,Twitter Web Client,8,35
It means acknowledging that male privilege is real. Using that privilege to fight for leadership opportunities for women. Calling out sexism especially in spaces where no women are present.

Today is International Women's Day - a great opportunity to celebrate the strong women in my life and to share my appreciation with you.  But that's not nearly enough.

I’m proud to join over 100 of my colleagues in co-sponsoring the new #MedicareForAll bill. I'm deeply appreciative to @PramilaJayapal for her leadership.

I'm fighting for a new system: A moral capitalism judged not just by how much it produces but how widely it empowers. By how many people it lifts out of poverty not how many of the rich it makes richer. https://t.co/sI3ejiHyUO,2019-02-21 13:06:56,Twitter for iPhone,40,189
But stock prices don't tell a country's full economic story. Medical bankruptcies and foreclosures and stagnant paychecks do too. Student loans. The cost of daycare and doctors. Wages that won't budge. Jobs displaced. Retirements on edge.,2019-02-21 13:06:55,Twitter for iPhone,29,128
Donald Trump bragged during his State of the Union address that our country is "considered far and away the hottest economy in the world." From one standpoint he's right.

This week the Supreme Court allowed Donald Trump’s ban on transgender troops to proceed. As if gender identity has anything to do with love of country. As if he has any right to comment on another American’s courage.,2019-01-27 15:32:02,Twitter Web Client,63,266
President Trump inflicted real pain on thousands of American families over a campaign promise he couldn't keep. 35 days of missed paychecks disrupted federal services &amp; national security threats.

We must demand insurers treat behavioral health equal to physical health. Protect Medicaid the largest single-payer of mental health treatment.

As we fight against GOP efforts to dismantle the ACA &amp; push for universal care one thing is critical: We must keep mental health care at the center of that conversation.
