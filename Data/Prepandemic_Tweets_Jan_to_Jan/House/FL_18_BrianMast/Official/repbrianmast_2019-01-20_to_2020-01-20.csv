@sassywpl @Illiberalality @brianmast What is a lie about this? I included the quote from the actual bill. https://t.co/E70AtvKD1U,2019-01-23 23:50:37,TweetDeck,0,1
@Illiberalality If you purchased a firearm through a dealer that already required a background check this bill wouldn't change anything for you; it wouldn't make it take any longer or make the process any harder to make the purchase.,2019-01-23 23:49:45,TweetDeck,0,0

HAPPENING SOON: I will join @LizMacDonaldFOX on the @EveningEdit at 6pm to discuss the need to pay the servicemembers of our Coast Guard!,2019-01-23 22:50:00,TweetDeck,4,12
@Illiberalality Nor should you.  I would never support a gun registry.  In fact the bill I do support for background checks specifically says no gun registry: https://t.co/wkHaTyrEpX,2019-01-23 22:36:45,TweetDeck,1,4
@LizzieBelle66 I don't support gun registries.  Period.  And in fact this is what the bill says on the topic: https://t.co/qBI0iKOMn8,2019-01-23 21:18:31,TweetDeck,3,4

We've made great progress for our nation’s veterans but there's MUCH more work to be done!

Today we honor the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr. As a Member of Congress I know I was not sent to Washington to do just what’s easy — I was sent here to take action and that's exactly what I will continue to do each and every day. #MLKDay https://t.co/6XowIVEfcE,2019-01-21 15:15:00,TweetDeck,8,20
Did you see this? → Last week we introduced a bipartisan bill to address the health crisis facing our veterans who were exposed to burn pits and toxic airborne chemicals.
