John Dingell’s lifetime of service helped drive a century of progress in America. This is a heartbreaking loss for the entire country and my thoughts are with my friend @RepDebDingell during this difficult time. https://t.co/xFSrPouDCu,2019-02-08 17:22:08,Twitter for iPhone,2,8
Our bipartisan bill will not only expand environmental conservation it will also create jobs in the Inland Empire. Proud to have worked with @RepPaulCook on this local priority and grateful to have the support of @SenFeinstein and @SenKamalaHarris. https://t.co/e2cFXzKKAl,2019-02-07 22:45:44,Twitter Web Client,8,18
This week I responded to a 13-year-old in our community who wrote to me “People deserve the right to work without being afraid the government might shut down.”  He’s absolutely right. I told him I’ll continue working to ensure we avoid another senseless shutdown. #DearPete https://t.co/Kw0cFM4bk2,2019-02-06 20:59:15,Twitter for iPhone,3,27
Honored to be joined for tonight’s #SOTU by Sr. Hortencia Del Villar Director of Social Concerns of the Catholic Diocese of San Bernardino and immigrant-rights advocate.

Let's be clear - @realdonaldtrump's failure to fulfill a campaign promise does not constitute a national emergency. It's time for him to let Congress do our job and provide funding for smart effective solutions at the southern border. #SOTU https://t.co/pBYu6Iy2Ue,2019-02-05 18:01:30,Twitter Media Studio,22,55
On this day 106 years ago Rosa Parks was born. Her famous act of bravery helped spark a movement that would change America and the world forever. #BlackHistoryMonth https://t.co/f3nfXzr2Pc,2019-02-04 22:30:04,Twitter Web Client,1,12
Right now only about 17% of commercial vehicles are scanned at ports of entry.   Investments in technology at our ports will stop these types of shipments in the future. @realDonaldTrump's wall will not. https://t.co/f6jVDpYRAk,2019-01-31 19:39:04,Twitter Web Client,15,31
As members of the conference committee our job is to worry about the facts not semantics.

By utilizing technology at our southern border we'll be addressing a modern problem with modern solutions. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to produce a compromise that enhances border security in smart effective ways. https://t.co/QeHaFxyKNU,2019-01-30 23:22:29,Twitter Media Studio,11,48
Honored to receive @NatlHeadStart’s 2019 Pledge Award.  One of my first jobs was working as a Head Start teacher’s aide where I learned that we have a responsibility to ensure that every child has an opportunity to succeed. Years later I took that lesson with me to Congress. https://t.co/tu4KH0HxLJ,2019-01-30 15:45:57,Twitter for iPhone,3,26
I'm committed to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to find smart solutions that will enhance security at our southern border while upholding the values that make our country great. I look forward to getting started. https://t.co/0dxMsQZril,2019-01-29 18:59:16,Twitter Media Studio,8,23
Bill dedicated much of his life to our community and his legacy of service won’t soon be forgotten. It was an honor to know him and to work with him to address regional concerns. My thoughts are with his loved ones during this difficult time. https://t.co/dnB9eNrqSC,2019-01-28 20:55:59,Twitter Web Client,2,6
Moving forward it is my hope that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will work together to reach an agreement to enhance border security through evidence-based solutions. I look forward to being a part of those efforts.,2019-01-25 21:49:10,Twitter Web Client,3,20
I’m glad that the president has finally decided to end his disastrous shutdown but hundreds of thousands of Americans including many here in the Inland Empire suffered needlessly for 35 days because of his refusal to compromise on his demands for a border wall.,2019-01-25 21:49:10,Twitter Web Client,3,27
“Each missed paycheck is another two weeks that my daughter will go without medication and treatment.”  Graciela’s is one of the many #ShutdownStories that I’ve received from our community since the president shut down the government. People are hurting. Time to #EndTheShutdown. https://t.co/xP8K3cfQai,2019-01-25 00:31:01,Twitter Media Studio,17,41

Joined my friend @RepDarrenSoto to serve meals to federal employees @WCKitchen. Grateful for the generosity of people like @chefjoseandres who make this happen but federal employees still deserve better. It’s time for @realDonaldTrump to #EndTheShutdown and open the government. https://t.co/gP08Z7kumC,2019-01-23 23:24:59,Twitter for iPhone,17,79
I’m in Washington this week voting with my House colleagues to #EndTheShutdown but I made sure I had some time today to take questions from students at @OrangewoodHS in Redlands. Thanks for letting me crash your class Ms. Wilson! https://t.co/9hOVl7PPE6,2019-01-23 19:18:37,Twitter for iPhone,7,39
