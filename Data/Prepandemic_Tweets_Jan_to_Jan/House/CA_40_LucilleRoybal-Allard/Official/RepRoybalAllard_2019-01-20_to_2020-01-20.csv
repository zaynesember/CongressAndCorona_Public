Congress didn't give the president the money he wanted to build his ineffective and wasteful border wall so he declared a #FakeEmergency. I proudly voted to reject the president's unconstitutional power grab and today I call on my Senate colleagues to reject it as well. https://t.co/In2Ja4BuNy,2019-03-14 17:32:08,Twitter Web Client,8,21
Protecting the integrity of our elections is essential to the well-being of our democracy. At today’s #DHS Appropriations hearing I questioned @CISAgov Director Christopher Krebs about his agency’s efforts to ensure our elections are secure. @CISAKrebs https://t.co/peHKqRZ6ng,2019-03-13 23:29:21,Twitter Media Studio,2,6
I fully support Governor Newsom halting the death penalty in California. The death penalty is discriminatory ineffective deeply error-ridden and cruel. The governor’s decision is an important step in improving our justice system. https://t.co/TQHE7tU5W7,2019-03-13 22:43:58,Twitter Web Client,1,8
In 30 states #LGBTQ individuals are at risk of being fired evicted or denied services because of who they are. That's utterly shameful and it's why I'm cosponsoring the #EqualityAct to guarantee our LGBTQ community federal protections under our #CivilRights laws. #HR5 https://t.co/hohe27F4uZ,2019-03-13 20:35:17,Twitter Web Client,6,13
