@MiekeEoyang @RebeccaShabad @GOPLeader @RepMikeRogers The goal is to protect the whistleblower. If the DNI interpretation is such (it is) then you are putting the whistleblower at risk of losing livelihood and being charged with a crime. Which defeats purpose of whistleblower.

@RebeccaShabad @GOPLeader @RepMikeRogers Rogers may have said that. But the statute is very clear that the whistleblower cannot do that. He must work with DNI/IG to coordinate testimony to Congress. He is not cleared by DNI to do that. DNI is blocking his path.,2019-09-20 16:17:52,Twitter for iPhone,198,926
