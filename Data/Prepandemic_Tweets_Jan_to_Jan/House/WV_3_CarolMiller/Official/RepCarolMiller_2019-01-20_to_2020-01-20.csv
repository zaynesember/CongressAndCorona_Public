West Virginia has been hit especially hard by illegal drugs smuggled across our southern border. Just two weeks ago Customs and Border Protection seized enough fentanyl to kill every person in West Virginia 32 times over.

Yesterday Congress secured funding for 55 miles of border wall to be constructed where it is most desperately needed - but that doesn’t go far enough.
