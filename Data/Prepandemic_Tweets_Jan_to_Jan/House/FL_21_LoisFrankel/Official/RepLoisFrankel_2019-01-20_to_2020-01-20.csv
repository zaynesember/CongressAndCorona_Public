.@realDonaldTrump if you wanted to protect access to health care you would stop sabotaging the #ACA.   But while you were busy shutting down the government Democrats took action on day 1 of the 116th Congress to protect 133 MILLION Americans with pre-existing conditions. #SOTU,2019-02-06 02:56:39,TweetDeck,8,33
Hey @realDonaldTrump if you really want to empower women you should get behind @HouseDemocrats #ForThePeople agenda! It's time to raise wages pass the #PaycheckFairness Act &amp; ensure women have access to affordable quality health care #SOTU,2019-02-06 02:49:12,Twitter Web Client,22,98

I agree w/ @RepEliotEngel &amp; @RepAdamSmith – we should be working w/ our allies to hold Russia accountable for their noncompliance.
