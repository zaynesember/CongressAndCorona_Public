Today is #EqualPayDay which is how much longer a woman with the same level of experience must work to earn the same amount of money as a man in the same job. We can achieve pay equality.

Considering the Attorney General’s bias toward the Special Counsel’s investigation the American people deserve to see for themselves what is in the report.,2019-03-24 23:45:24,Twitter Web Client,6,40
One thing is clear as the Attorney General states the Special Counsel’s report does not exonerate the President on the serious charge of obstruction of justice.
