Today I'm leading 75 of my colleagues to call on House leadership to finally bring the PRO Act to the House floor for a vote.

The House has passed important legislation to lower Rx drug costs fight corruption &amp; big money in politics and many other priorities.  Public support for unions is at a 50-year high. The PRO Act is a bipartisan bill with over 200 cosponsors.  So why wait to pass #PROActNow?,2020-01-09 19:01:49,Twitter Web App,5,10
The PRO Act is one of the most significant bills to empower American workers and unions in decades.  The PRO Act: - Strengthens unions' power to negotiate &amp; organize - Provides new protections for workers - Holds employers who violate workers' rights accountable  #PROActNow,2020-01-09 19:01:49,Twitter Web App,6,9
For decades the power of working people to organize &amp; stand up for their rights has been stripped away. The results have been predictable. In the last 40 yrs: - the top 1% of earned 200% more - income for working folks barely budged.  That's why we need #PROActNow,2020-01-09 19:01:49,Twitter Web App,18,28

I spoke on the floor this morning to lay out the case for freezing NOAA’s regulations on lobstermen until they put their data tool through peer review. We should work to protect right whales but we have to do it with sound science and data. #mepolitics,2019-06-20 21:12:39,Twitter Web Client,3,19
Thanks to @ChelliePingree for joining me to sponsor this amendment.,2019-06-20 13:50:19,Twitter Web Client,2,9
My amendment is pretty simple. It blocks NOAA from enforcing the new regulations until NOAA's data tool goes through a scientific peer review.   This is a basic step for good policy-making but NOAA blew by it. Sound science and good data shouldn’t be too much to expect. 3/,2019-06-20 13:49:38,Twitter Web Client,1,5

Management of ME fisheries should be based on the best available data &amp; science but that clearly hasn't happened here. On behalf of Maine's lobstermen I urge NOAA Fisheries to postpone its rulemaking and engage with stakeholders to develop an accurate risk assessment tool. 6/,2019-04-23 13:50:35,Twitter Web Client,1,6
And the underlying data used in the risk assessment tool might not tell us the whole picture. Stakeholders tell us there’s a good chance the model generated by the tool won’t account for the present-day distributional shift of the right whales. 5/,2019-04-23 13:50:35,Twitter Web Client,1,2
NOAA’s risk assessment tool is a scientific model with implications for thousands of Mainers and an entire species of whale but it hasn’t been peer-reviewed. The tool wasn’t even made public until a few days ago. 4/,2019-04-23 13:50:35,Twitter Web Client,1,1
In the last 2 yrs 12 of the 20 stranded right whales found were discovered in Canadian waters where Canadian fishermen aren’t subject to the same whale protection measures. But the risk assessment tool fails to incorporate the impact of Canadian fisheries on whale deaths. 3/,2019-04-23 13:50:35,Twitter Web Client,1,2
NOAA Fisheries' new restrictions are supposed to protect the right whale. But the method NOAA uses to justify these rules – called the ‘risk assessment tool’– uses data &amp; assumptions that may be unreliable.

We need common-sense solutions to lower healthcare costs. Addressing the rising cost of Rx drugs is a step we can take right now.

How do corporations get away with this?   When they develop a new drug the gov’t gives Rx companies a years-long monopoly. They can skyrocket prices with no competition. It’s a system intended to promote R&amp;D but many pharma companies abuse it on the backs of Maine people.,2019-02-14 00:08:20,Twitter Web Client,4,7
Rx drug prices have been out of control for years but in 2016 we saw just how abusive drug companies had become. In the space of 9 years amid record profits Mylan shot its prices for the life-saving allergy drug Epipen up by 400% https://t.co/lJAJ9deuc8,2019-02-13 19:00:22,Twitter Web Client,3,12

I'm honored to join the Seapower &amp; Projection Forces Subcommittee where I'll fight for our shipyard jobs and work across the aisle to strengthen our national defense. https://t.co/QwLt6dC3yr,2019-01-26 23:12:00,TweetDeck,11,80
We need to lower the cost of healthcare for Maine people across the state. It’s especially important in rural communities.   This grant will help Pines Health Services improve affordable care to Maine people across Aroostook County.  https://t.co/4ONsuJS1Vw,2019-01-26 15:45:00,TweetDeck,8,29
This deal lasts for just 3 wks. Both parties agree we need an open functioning government both parties agree we need strong borders and both parties agree we need to work together. Now it's time for Congress to do its job and put action behind its words. (2/2) #mepolitics,2019-01-25 22:14:52,Twitter Web Client,9,54
Today the president finally accepted a bipartisan proposal to end the shutdown. This isn't about 1 side winning and 1 side losing. It's about getting our gov't workers paid stopping families’ suffering &amp; putting politics aside to get things done for Maine &amp; our country. (1/2),2019-01-25 22:14:52,Twitter Web Client,13,59
@CraigErskine3 We're sorry this is happening Mr. Erskine and we'll help however we can.

We'll send you a direct message to find the best way to get in touch. - staff,2019-01-25 15:12:23,Twitter Web Client,0,0
We have the raw ingredients for a deal. Both parties believe we need to open the government &amp; pay gov't employees. Both parties believe we need to secure our border. It's time for party leaders to put actions behind their words &amp; work together to end the shutdown (4/4),2019-01-25 02:09:33,Twitter Web Client,2,19
Today the President’s proposal failed in the Senate. So did the clean funding bill Democrats and some Republicans passed through the House. These failures should shake the leaders of both parties awake. It’s time to stop talking past each other and get to work. (3/4),2019-01-25 02:09:33,Twitter Web Client,2,13
Last weekend I was in Presque Isle Caribou Littleton Millinocket Mapleton Bangor &amp; Lewiston talking with Maine people. They were very clear: they want our nation’s leaders to come to the negotiating table and end this shutdown. (2/4),2019-01-25 02:09:33,Twitter Web Client,2,13
There are over 1000 federal workers in Maine affected by the shutdown. Most of them will miss their second paycheck this week. Credit card mortgage and heating bills are due. People who choose to public service deserve better from our gov’t. (1/4) #mepolitics,2019-01-25 02:09:33,Twitter Web Client,12,54
I believe anyone who loves America and has the courage to serve should be given that opportunity and respected for it.  The Administration is wrong about this. I'll use my seat on the Armed Services Committee to fight for ALL our servicemembers. https://t.co/wGU8LYf49g,2019-01-22 17:02:13,TweetDeck,77,306
Looking forward to working with Penobscot Nation Chief Kirk Francis. It was honor to be there for his induction this weekend. https://t.co/nhq5lxvIyI,2019-01-21 23:40:00,TweetDeck,16,131
As we reflect on Dr. King over #MLKDay let's aim to live up to his example of service. Opportunities to serve our community our state and our country are everywhere. It's up to each of us to act on them. https://t.co/Y0NdQefL7p,2019-01-21 17:38:00,TweetDeck,11,33
Had some great conversations with snowmobilers in Littleton and East Millinocket this weekend. Snowmobiling is big for local economies in Maine and clubs like these help make it all possible.   Next time I’m driving. https://t.co/z6D9zIOwY2,2019-01-21 15:01:00,TweetDeck,4,34

Forcing Coast Guardsmen to go without pay and allowing their families to suffer is unacceptable. All servicemembers must be paid for their service plain and simple. @chelliepingree and I are backing a bill to pay these Mainers.  https://t.co/vFiHzggynH,2019-01-20 20:37:00,TweetDeck,22,103
We headed up to the County this weekend where I had a chance to sit down with members of the Maine Potato Board. I look forward to working with them and their family businesses to promote and grow Maine’s agriculture economy. @saypotato https://t.co/PcLfVFlv2H,2019-01-20 16:51:00,TweetDeck,4,56
Federal employees including over 1000 Mainers have been hit hard by the shutdown. But they still love their jobs and they believe in service.   Their commitment to service is something I've been thinking about a lot in the last few weeks. My thoughts:  https://t.co/CIzUjkLilm,2019-01-20 14:45:57,TweetDeck,9,38
