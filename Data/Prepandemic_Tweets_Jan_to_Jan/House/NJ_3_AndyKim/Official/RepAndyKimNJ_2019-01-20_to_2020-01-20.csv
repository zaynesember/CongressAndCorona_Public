I'm proud to have just voted to pass HR840 which expands child care services for our veterans. This is a proven approach that helps those who have severed our nation and we must continue to find ways to improve services for our vets.  #ChildCare4Vets https://t.co/Xp92VLS6hI,2019-02-08 17:17:44,TweetDeck,11,37

I want to thank Petty Officer Thornton and the @USCG again for being my guest at the #SOTU. His service and the service of all our men and women in uniform is an important part of what keeps our country great. https://t.co/CzR4NDjg3I,2019-02-06 13:20:09,Twitter for iPhone,5,36

Some thoughts post #SOTU:  I came to Congress to deliver for the people of New Jersey’s Third Congressional District. If the President is serious in his calls for more bipartisan action the time is now to show those calls are more than just empty talk.,2019-02-06 03:46:46,Twitter Web Client,4,25

Proud to stand with @RepMalinowski and a bipartisan group to stand for a responsible foreign policy that ensures that when we ask our servicemen and women to serve it’s done with our national security and not politics in mind. https://t.co/vmoXHQiuvy,2019-01-30 16:15:31,Twitter for iPhone,8,26
No one wins in a government shutdown. I'm proud to join my freshmen colleagues to introduce the Shutdown to End All Shutdowns (SEAS) Act to make sure working men and women don't suffer if we have another shutdown. #HR834 #NoMoreShutdowns #SEASact,2019-01-30 14:46:28,Twitter for iPhone,15,57
