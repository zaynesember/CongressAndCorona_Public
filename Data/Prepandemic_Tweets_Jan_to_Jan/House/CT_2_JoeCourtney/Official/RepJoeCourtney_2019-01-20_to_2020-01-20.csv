As Chairman of the #Seapower &amp; Projection Forces subcommittee I've been in constant touch w/ Navy &amp; DoD leaders to press for a 10-boat contract. This announcement comes at an exciting time for our region and I know eastern #CT's #manufacturing workforce is up to the task.,2019-12-02 23:25:51,Twitter Web App,2,7

Following 10 years of work the House is finally about to vote on #HR748 my bill to repeal the #CadillacTax once and for all. 181 million Americans receive #healthcare through their employer and a 40% tax on their plans would cause the cost of their care to skyrocket. https://t.co/LomFMmgYd3,2019-07-17 17:06:54,Twitter Web Client,13,16

.@HASCDemocrats just passed my #fy20NDAA amendment to prevent @deptofdefense restrictions on GI Bill transferability like those due to go into effect next month.
