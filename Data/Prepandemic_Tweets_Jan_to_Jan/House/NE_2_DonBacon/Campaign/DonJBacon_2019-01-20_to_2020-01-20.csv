It might be cold here in Lincoln but my heart is warmed by this great crowd at the #Nebraska Walk for Life! I'm truly impressed not just at the amazing turnout here year after year but that so many Nebraskans are willing to stand for the most innocent among us. #ProLife https://t.co/vwuoN0smyv,2019-01-26 17:29:16,Twitter for Android,4,30

The President has offered to compromise and make a win-win agreement. Pelosi and Schumer should do same. Collin Peterson and other Dems are asking for real negotiations... I thank them for speaking up. https://t.co/ovzuwW12BA,2019-01-23 13:07:22,Twitter for iPhone,8,32
Roe v Wade was 46 years ago today. I believe life begins at conception and all life is precious. I will continue fighting to defend preborn babies - the most innocent among us. We must continue working to protect life. Every baby deserves a birthday. #ProLife https://t.co/k4siF9nrZJ,2019-01-22 20:30:00,TweetDeck,17,76
Not all wounds and scars are visible. If you or someone you know is struggling with PTS help is available. I post this reminder on the 22nd of each month in honor of the 22 brave veterans who lose their battle with PTS each day. You are not alone! #22buddycheck https://t.co/K53luklAZv,2019-01-22 18:31:33,Twitter Web Client,6,8
Martin Luther King Jr. believed that we could all unite to stand against hate. On #MLKDay we honor Dr. King for his contributions &amp; sacrifices as one of our nation's finest sons. We can honor his legacy every day by working toward compassion &amp; civility instead of hate &amp; vitriol. https://t.co/LElbg9s8z5,2019-01-21 16:43:34,Twitter Web Client,4,18
