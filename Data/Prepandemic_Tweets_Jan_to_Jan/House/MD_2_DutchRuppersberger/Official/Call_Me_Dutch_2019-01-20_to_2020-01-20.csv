Goodness. @JohnDingell was so smart so funny and so real. He served 60 years in Congress -  longer than anyone else ever - yet seemed to accomplish the work of 500 years. So he will forever be a part of our future too. RIP.,2019-02-08 04:23:42,Twitter for iPhone,4,10
Frank Robinson was one of the best – being a kid in Baltimore was FUN because I got to watch him play for the O’s. He was the missing piece to the puzzle that got @orioles their first World Series championship. RIP #frankrobinson. https://t.co/hVhjDdH7HQ,2019-02-07 21:54:57,Twitter Web Client,7,19

Drugmakers kicked off 2019 by raising prices on 250+ drugs in the US including the world’s top-selling medicine Humira. One of my own staffers pays over $600 w/ insurance for her medication each month. Enough. #EndRxMonopolyPrices,2019-02-07 17:14:06,Twitter Web Client,8,12
The Medicare Negotiation and Competitive Licensing Act will allow Medicare to finally negotiate drug prices on behalf of Americans. Let's open up the market for prescription drug prices—and keep patients from being taken advantage of by Big Pharma. #EndRxMonopolyPrices,2019-02-07 17:09:49,Twitter Web Client,8,15

.@HouseJudiciary held the first #gunviolence hearing in 8 years - one day after @realdonaldtrump failed to mentioned this crisis at the #SOTU. It’s not about taking guns away. It’s about common sense safety measures starting w/ background checks. My thoughts: https://t.co/HyflqpoBJG,2019-02-07 03:12:20,Twitter for iPhone,14,58
82-minute #SOTU and not one mention of #cyber!? Instead of demanding border wall @realDonaldTrump should be demanding cyber wall!

"If there is going to be peace and legislation there cannot be war and investigation." Cute rhyme but @realDonaldTrump should not fear investigation if he has done nothing wrong.  Congress and the special prosecutor should follow the facts whichever way they lead.,2019-02-06 02:35:35,Twitter for iPhone,8,26
The color white has been symbolic of the women’s suffragette movement. I am wearing white to the #SOTU tonight to celebrate the historic 106 women currently serving in the House.

Charges against @Huawei are not surprising at all. We’ve been sounding the alarm on this company for years.
