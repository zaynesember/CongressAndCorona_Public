300+ national security &amp; foreign policy officials called it a “profound national security concern”.  17 Watergate prosecutors told us it met the same standard for Nixon’s impeachable conduct.

If @POTUS is serious about merit-based legal immigration he should help usher this bill into law. https://t.co/exFT9W9BhZ,2019-07-10 20:58:59,Twitter Media Studio,1606,2761
America’s elections are at the very core of our democracy. We must do all we can to ensure they truly represent the will of the people. Proud to know we’ve taken important steps in protecting our national security with passing the #SAFEAct last week. https://t.co/IhZO9NKFn0,2019-06-29 13:30:01,Twitter Media Studio,518,1506
I’m proud that the House passed my bill the #SAFEAct to protect our elections from foreign attacks by updating our vulnerable &amp; outdated voting systems. Now @Senatemajldr McConnell must put Americans first and politics aside by passing this important election security bill.,2019-06-27 20:56:33,Twitter Web Client,69,180
Trump’s chaotic policies have exacerbated the US border situation causing death and unforgivable conditions for migrants. If the Executive fails Congress must act.

If #SCOTUS won’t fight to protect Americans’ votes I will.

One year ago today #SCOTUS shamefully upheld the President’s policy of excluding immigrants based on their religion. This #MuslimBan is unconstitutional un-American and must be overturned. As a cosponsor of the #NoBanAct I will keep fighting against bigotry and islamophobia.,2019-06-26 23:41:49,Twitter for iPhone,9,33
Happy to join @SpeakerPelosi &amp; @SenSchumer today to discuss the #SAFEAct my bill to protect our elections from foreign interference. The Mueller Report declared that Russia targeted election administration officials across the US in 2016. We can’t let that happen again in 2020. https://t.co/yJukwDqsZE,2019-06-26 22:25:30,Twitter for iPhone,10,35
Congress must act when the President welcomes foreign attacks on our elections. That is why @HouseAdm_Dems passed my bill today the #SAFEAct to protect our democracy and enhance our election security. https://t.co/6ArvYpWle9,2019-06-21 15:24:35,Twitter Web Client,77,139

Millions of Sudanese citizens accomplished what was once unthinkable by ending the 30-year rule of dictator al-Bashir &amp; paving the way for democratic government.

President Trump’s willingness to accept foreign help for his 2020 campaign is a green light to America’s adversaries to meddle in our elections. It’s wrong and dangerous. https://t.co/ErURzEyvak,2019-06-13 20:02:18,Twitter Web Client,20,35
Congress can't conduct effective oversight of the Executive without the evidence that underlies the Mueller Report.

Congress just passed a disaster relief package for Americans hurt by flooding and wildfires including those in California. Disaster relief should never become politicized or stalled.

Many members of Congress and many members of the public are frustrated and concerned about @POTUS’ behavior. Congress will continue to gather evidence and go to court to enforce our subpoenas of the underlying documents and fact witnesses from the Mueller Investigation. https://t.co/R3BjkvcKeb,2019-06-01 21:01:59,Twitter Web Client,6,29
Trump’s plan to impose tariffs on Mexico is legally dubious and will likely be challenged in court. It also misses the point. No amount of punitive actions will stop people from fleeing for their lives.

It's heartbreaking that 6 children have died after being held in US custody at the border. That is unacceptable.

I've worked on two prior impeachments so this isn’t my first rodeo when it comes to misbehavior in the White House.

100 years ago today the House passed the 19th Amendment giving women the right to vote.
