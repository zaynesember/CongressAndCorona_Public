@mcfiddlesby Hi Zoe! 👋🏽 First off thanks for listening to that! Secondly they did pronounce my name correctly... Zoe like “Joe” or “Zo”. Hope you’re having a great July 4th!! — Zoe (like Joe!),2019-07-04 22:35:50,Twitter for iPhone,0,0
Wishing everyone a happy and safe 4th of July. We have a lot to celebrate and much to be proud of as a nation — but the work and the promise to create that more perfect Union continues on. And I am more energized than ever to help lead that fight. 🇺🇸,2019-07-04 22:32:38,Twitter for iPhone,1,13

2 weeks ago I was proud to host my Women’s Lunch and 2020 campaign kickoff. I was even more proud that my friend Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi sent a special welcome and offered her full-throttle endorsement of my 2020 re-election. https://t.co/FPPkAihVzA,2019-05-21 01:38:18,Twitter for iPhone,1,4
I am so grateful that my friend @toniatkins joined us yesterday for my Women’s Luncheon and 2020 campaign kickoff.
