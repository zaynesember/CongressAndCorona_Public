Vietnam vets weren’t always welcomed w/ parades &amp; tributes due to divisiveness of the war.  Like all veterans they should've been commended for their bravery &amp; service. It was powerful to hear personal &amp; moving stories at my @vietnamwar50th ceremony 🇺🇸 https://t.co/P3HmGvL6qc,2019-04-26 18:40:19,Twitter Web Client,2,7

As noted in this story national drug distributors bear responsibility for the huge costs to families &amp; communities for the opioid epidemic.

Three short years ago 175 countries including the United States signed the Paris Climate Agreement. The #ClimateActionNow Act (HR9) would require the Trump Administration to honor that commitment. Let's pass this bill. https://t.co/lqToCNOONz,2019-04-22 21:58:00,TweetDeck,26,76
Climate action has to be local and global. We just held an #EarthDay town hall on public transit here in Tampa. And HR9 my bill to keep us in the Paris Climate Agreement keeps moving forward in Congress.

Castor: 'Russia Broke Law Trump Cheered Them On' https://t.co/n5lzRvLczB via #MuellerReport,2019-04-19 12:38:13,Twitter Web Client,4,16
Now the American people &amp; the Congress must determine the ultimate outcome. For me the #MuellerReport laid bare Trump’s corrupt selfish &amp; disgraceful actions. Trump relishes dividing our great country – and I regret that the Russians have prevailed in their goals through him.,2019-04-18 21:32:06,Twitter Web Client,4,15
The Special Counsel charged &amp; convicted numerous Trump campaign &amp; admin officials for lying under oath to cover their actions. The Special Counsel also determined that Trump may have acted unlawfully in obstructing justice &amp; the Counsel should explain his findings before Congress,2019-04-18 21:32:05,Twitter Web Client,2,13
While the Special Counsel did not have sufficient evidence to charge Trump or his campaign associates with ‘conspiracy’ the #MuellerReport is a damning indictment of Trump’s contempt for the high ideals that Americans hold for our presidential candidates and presidents.,2019-04-18 21:32:05,Twitter Web Client,1,3
Every American should be outraged that the Russian government attacked our presidential election to boost Donald Trump and that Trump’s response to this ‘information warfare’ was to embrace it. https://t.co/c7QRrPf3yi,2019-04-18 21:32:05,Twitter Web Client,7,24
