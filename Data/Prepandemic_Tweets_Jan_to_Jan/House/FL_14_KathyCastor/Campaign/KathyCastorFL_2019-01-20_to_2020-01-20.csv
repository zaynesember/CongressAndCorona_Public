Meanwhile the important work for the people continues: to lower the costs of health care to fight for action on climate change to end gun violence to lower prescription drug costs and to improve the future for our kids. But today my oath required that I impeach the President,2019-12-19 01:53:03,Twitter for iPhone,7,15
The President’s actions have left us no choice but to impeach. My Republican colleagues will have to explain their vote to their children and grandchildren.,2019-12-19 01:53:03,Twitter for iPhone,5,17
Trump urged interference in our election and fired diplomats who stood in the way. Trump then obstructed the investigation into his misconduct. It is a stunning betrayal of America and America’s national security.,2019-12-19 01:53:03,Twitter for iPhone,1,4
President Trump abused his power when he attempted to extort the vulnerable Ukrainian President Zelensky by withholding bipartisan foreign aid and pressed him to manufacture political dirt on a political rival.,2019-12-19 01:53:02,Twitter for iPhone,1,5
Today the House of Representatives voted to impeach the President of the United States for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Trump betrayed the American people and the U.S. Constitution.  I did not make this decision lightly.,2019-12-19 01:53:01,Twitter for iPhone,19,36

In reality Trump has worked to rip away protections from our most vulnerable neighbors block efforts to raise the minimum wage and cut investments in transit bridges and transportation improvements that keep us moving.    #TrumpsBrokenPromises,2019-11-26 14:04:08,Twitter for iPhone,0,2
