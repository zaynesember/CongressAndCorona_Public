.@RepJohnJoyce and I led a bipartisan group of members calling on the FDA to crack down on companies who label non-dairy products as milk. Dairy farmers in Upstate NY set high standards for the milk they produce. Copycat products shouldn’t be able to profit off their hard work. https://t.co/nFE7LOoP2c,2019-01-31 15:53:49,TweetDeck,5,39
