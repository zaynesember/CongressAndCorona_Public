🙋🏻‍♂️Raise your hand if your phone autocorrects “spoons” to SPOONSS  ...Worth it to champion the SPOONSS Act signed into law by President Trump after the last representative couldn’t get it done. This law will bring new jobs and more money to back to NY-22!  https://t.co/Fug3OutUlr,2020-01-10 17:33:36,Twitter Web App,10,41
From bringing jobs back to Upstate to improving mental health resources for our Veterans - we’ve been working hard to deliver results for NY-22 together.   And there’s more to look forward to in 2020!  Read about it here: https://t.co/pe808qK8S9,2020-01-10 13:01:16,Twitter Web App,6,20

JUST SAY NO! The plan to end the @NYWFP line pushed by the Public Financing Commission will disenfranchise thousands of voters across the state and hurt representatives that are fighting for working families.,2019-11-21 19:28:10,Twitter for iPhone,31,92
@claudiatenney @RepBrindisi @claudiatenney I might not agree with you on that (based on facts and your own record on this issue) BUT you’re one of my constituents and I will always fight for you.,2019-11-12 22:09:33,Twitter for iPhone,5,31
THE CABLE GUY: If you’ve followed my uphill climb against Spectrum our rising rates locally and the company’s monopoly-like grip over our area you’ll be happy to know: the fight ain’t over. I won’t rest until they blink. https://t.co/EnoUEokMUv,2019-11-12 13:19:14,Twitter for iPhone,25,80

Kicked off Broome County’s Summer Lunch program at the Binghamton Boys &amp; Girls Club this week! I’m working to make sure all Upstate NY kids have access to healthy meals.

Dairy is a critical part of the Upstate economy and we’re working hard to make sure local farmers have the tools and resources they need to succeed.

We must permanently #Renew911VCF. I’m calling on congressional leaders to bring the bill up for a vote this month. It’s the least we can do for our 9/11 heroes. https://t.co/5eJIYBGBOz,2019-07-03 20:40:16,Twitter for iPhone,3,35

Yesterday the House passed the #SaveTheNet Act to restore #NetNeutrality. Unfortunately Mitch McConnell has declared it "dead on arrival" in the Senate. This is not the way govt should work.

When so many voters rejected gutting the ACA I can’t fathom why they would press forward with attempts to repeal.
