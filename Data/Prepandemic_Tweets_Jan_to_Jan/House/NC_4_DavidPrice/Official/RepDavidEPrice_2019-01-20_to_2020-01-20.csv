Meanwhile both the @HUDOIG and @USGAO have raised important questions about HUD’s internal capacity staffing and oversight of the CDBG-DR program.,2019-10-17 19:20:51,Twitter Web App,2,4
Of course the CDBG-DR program is bigger than just PR although PR does seem to have been singled out.  Many states including NC are implementing action plans or awaiting additional notices from HUD to use disaster funding that was appropriated last yr &amp; in June of this yr.,2019-10-17 19:20:50,Twitter Web App,0,2
The other affected states had to wait 18 months which was bad enough but Puerto Rico is STILL waiting...  ICYMI: In PR—Nearly 3000 people lost their lives and tens of thousands of homes were damaged. I've been to PR and seen these challenges first hand.,2019-10-17 19:20:50,Twitter Web App,2,2
But that's not even the full story rather than comply with the clear statutory deadline (included in bipartisan legislation signed by the President) to issue the Fed Reg notice @HUDgov is still withholding the notice for PUERTO RICO.,2019-10-17 19:20:50,Twitter Web App,1,3
Low and middle-income families can’t wait 547 days to rebuild after a devastating storm.,2019-10-17 19:20:50,Twitter Web App,1,3
Issuing the Federal Register notice has taken longer in recent years.  After Sandy in 2012 it took 35 days.  After the 2017 hurricanes it took 145 days.  And more recently it took 547 days and even then the notice came only after Congress included a deadline by law.,2019-10-17 19:20:50,Twitter Web App,0,4
Without this notice states (like NC) cannot submit action plans to @Hudgov sign a grant agreement and begin to use the $—necessary steps that take at least several months once the notice is issued.,2019-10-17 19:20:49,Twitter Web App,0,3
Unfortunately Congress has never formally approved the CDBG-DR program.   This means each time Congress gives $ @HUDgov must issue a notice in the Federal Register that outlines how the funds can be used.,2019-10-17 19:20:49,Twitter Web App,0,3
In 2017 alone Congress set aside more than $35 billion across the federal government for people recovering from major hurricanes: Harvey Irma &amp; Maria.  To put this into perspective HUD’s entire budget in the last fiscal year was approximately $54 billion.,2019-10-17 19:20:49,Twitter Web App,0,2
Since 1993 Congress has provided more than $86 billion in funding for the CDBG-DR program.  As the severity and frequency of storms have increased so has the need for funding. *climate change*,2019-10-17 19:20:49,Twitter Web App,0,2
The grants primarily benefit low- and moderate-income people in the most impacted and distressed areas.,2019-10-17 19:20:49,Twitter Web App,0,2
.@HUDgov’s Community Development Block Grant-Disaster Recovery program (CDBG-DR) is a flexible &amp; vital tool for states &amp; municipalities to recover from major disasters.
