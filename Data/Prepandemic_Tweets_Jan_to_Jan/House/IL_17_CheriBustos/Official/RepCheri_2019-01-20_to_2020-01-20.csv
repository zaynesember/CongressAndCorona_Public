This bill would ensure that all iron and steel products used for projects in the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund are made entirely in the U.S. I hope this commonsense bill will move forward quickly for Illinois’ manufacturers and working families.,2019-11-20 22:29:40,Twitter Web App,3,6

Latinas and their families can’t afford to wait decades for the wage gap to close. It’s been more than 200 days since the House passed the bipartisan #PaycheckFairness Act. It’s time for the Senate to act. #DemandMore,2019-11-20 21:41:38,Twitter for iPhone,2,6

What a loss. Walter Jones was one of a kind. There are few Members of Congress who worked across the aisle like he did and I always sought him out on legislation.

The American people sent us here to govern w/ a purpose – not to bicker but to solve problems. I’ll continue working w/ anyone on either side of the aisle to bring down the cost of health care to invest in our infrastructure &amp; to clean up the corruption in D.C. #ForThePeople,2019-02-06 04:09:44,Twitter Web Client,6,19
The president spoke at length about bridging divides and healing wounds. I hope these weren’t just lines in a speech – but that he will stick to his word to find common ground and avoid another government shutdown in the coming weeks. #SOTU,2019-02-06 04:09:44,Twitter Web Client,1,14
And people with pre-existing conditions cannot ‘choose greatness’ when Washington Republicans continue working to rip away their critical patient protections. #ProtectOurCare #SOTU,2019-02-06 04:09:44,Twitter Web Client,7,8
However the families we serve deserve real solutions – not just soundbites. Farmers cannot ‘choose greatness’ when the president’s #tradewar is eliminating the very markets where they need to sell their goods. #SOTU,2019-02-06 04:09:44,Twitter Web Client,3,8
I’m also hopeful we can work together to bring down the cost of prescription drugs for seniors and families and as the president proposed make meaningful investments to fight conditions such as childhood cancer. #SOTU,2019-02-06 04:09:44,Twitter Web Client,2,8
Pleased tonight’s #SOTU included a commitment to invest in our infrastructure.

Thanks for chatting #SOTU w/ us. Farmers like Tom are navigating a tough farm economy – and this trade war is making it worse. POTUS’ theme tonight is “choosing greatness” but farmers can’t choose greatness if they don’t have markets to sell their goods. https://t.co/9MFjImIVuT,2019-02-06 01:09:49,Twitter for iPhone,8,14

That's just not right. Instead we should be fighting for policies that open markets for our farmers and reward their hard work – not hinder it.

Soybean farmers across Illinois have felt the impacts of this trade war on their bottom lines. Tom said it best when he stated “the reckless trade policies coming from the White House seriously threaten the future of family farms like mine.”,2019-02-05 18:06:14,Twitter Web Client,4,2
[THREAD] Today is the #SOTU and I’m so glad to have Tom Mueller as my guest.

.@POTUS’ trade war has been a gut-punch for farmers like Tom. Instead of opening trade markets he’s closing them. Instead of building trade allies he’s alienating them. We need stability &amp; sensible trade policies – but all farmers have gotten from the White House is chaos #SOTU https://t.co/by5hTKCHKe,2019-02-05 16:33:06,Twitter Web Client,13,27
