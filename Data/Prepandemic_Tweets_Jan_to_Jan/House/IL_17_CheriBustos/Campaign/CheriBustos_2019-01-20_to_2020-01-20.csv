I’m proud to share that the @dccc raised $8.8 million in May!   From the incredible support of folks at the grassroots it’s clear people across the country share our understanding that we can’t waste a moment defending and expanding the most diverse Majority in American history.,2019-6-20 16:59:00,Twitter for iPhone,25,89
Last month House Democrats passed the “Strengthening Health Care and Lowering Prescription Drug Costs Act” sweeping legislation that would keep families top-of-mind by lowering prescription drugs and health care. Next step: the GOP Senate.  Ball's in your court @Team_Mitch!,2019-6-20 13:50:00,Twitter Web App,3,13
Health care is a deeply personal issue and it's the number 1⃣ issue that I hear about from folks across the Heartland. I’m pleased to share that not only am I listening but I’m working hard to deliver real results and #ProtectOurCare. https://t.co/oMkDy2qwLn,2019-6-20 13:50:00,Twitter Web App,3,8

I’m committed to helping *all* Americans get access to quality affordable health care.  That’s why during House Democrats’ #HealthCareWeekend of Action I held a roundtable discussion about how we can work to expand rural health care. https://t.co/MisY9548HU,2019-6-19 16:51:00,Twitter for iPhone,0,2
America's free and fair elections should serve as a shining example of democracy. So as the @NRCC plays games with our national security House Democrats will fight day and night to secure our campaigns from foreign interference.  We won't budge an inch. https://t.co/2UJiRkcZv3,2019-6-19 14:10:00,Twitter Web App,13,34
Here is the “Phenomenal” Washington Republican plan:  ❌Gutting protections for people with pre-existing conditions. ❌Exploding the cost of health care coverage. ❌Skyrocketing prescription drug prices.  I join the American people to say: No thank you! https://t.co/dOyo6Xmv7p,2019-6-18 21:54:00,Twitter Web App,3,6
My case in point: House Democrats recently held a “Health Care Weekend of Action” back home in our districts across the country.  We know this is a deeply personal issue for our constituents -- that's why we'll never stop fighting to lower health care and prescription drug costs.,2019-6-18 19:51:00,Twitter Web App,10,18
While Washington Republicans promise to continue waging war on Americans’ health care my Democratic colleagues and I are working our tails off #ForThePeople and fighting back to #ProtectOurCare. https://t.co/qELmLMlH2H,2019-6-18 19:51:00,Twitter Web App,77,221
Last week’s retirement announcement from @NRCC Recruitment Chair (and #IN05 Congresswoman) @SusanBrooksIN further highlights Washington Republicans’ struggle to convince women to join their male-dominated GOP caucus. https://t.co/YOyFMmcrwk,2019-6-17 19:16:00,Twitter Web App,6,17
I’m proud that we have a proven track record at the @dccc of helping elect more and more women to Congress.  We know we can protect and expand our Democratic Majority but only if we include women in the conversation and continue empowering them to run for office.,2019-6-17 19:16:00,Twitter Web App,10,36

It’s more important than ever for us to ensure there’s plenty of room for women at the table. And as Chairwoman of the @dccc I’m fired up to protect and expand our Majority by doing just that.  𝐖𝐡𝐞𝐧 𝐰𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐧 𝐫𝐮𝐧 𝐰𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐧 𝐰𝐢𝐧.  Now let's do this! #MarchForward2020,2019-6-14 20:45:00,Twitter Web App,5,32
Look folks the contrast couldn’t be more stark.  In 2018 House Democrats elected a record-breaking number of women. We know that having female voices in Congress makes us stronger. There’s nothing women can’t do and I want to keep breaking that record election after election.,2019-6-14 20:45:00,Twitter Web App,4,26
I really do wish Rep. @SusanBrooksIN from #IN05 well on her retirement.  Washington Republicans have now lost one of only thirteen women in their ranks -- the @NRCC’s Recruitment Chair no less -- someone who the GOP attempted to prop up to attract more women to run for office.,2019-6-14 20:45:00,Twitter Web App,4,18
I currently serve alongside 101 congresswomen in the House. And guess how many of us are on the Democratic side of the aisle?  EIGHTY-NINE!  ...but if you ask me that's still not enough. We need more women serving in public office many more.,2019-6-14 20:45:00,Twitter Web App,5,28
I'm proud to lead a @dccc team that doesn't just talk about electing more women to public office -- we walk the walk. Female candidate recruitment is a pillar of our party’s effort to ensure “The People's House” actually looks like the people!,2019-6-14 20:45:00,Twitter Web App,39,153
I’ve worked with Rep. @SusanBrooksIN and I wish her well in her retirement.   As the ranks of women in the House Republican caucus continues to shrink it must be disappointing to lose such a strong advocate for Republican women.,2019-6-14 15:14:00,Twitter Web App,1,10
Leaders in the Republican Party continually marginalize women’s voices. And losing @SusanBrooksIN -- who was working hard to recruit women to run for office -- underscores the problem Washington Republicans have created for themselves.,2019-6-14 15:14:00,Twitter Web App,3,10
#IN05 has been a @dccc targeted district from the day we announced our offensive battlefield.  We intend to compete for (and win!) this district because we are determined to defend and grow our Democratic Majority.,2019-6-14 15:14:00,Twitter Web App,1,15
As head of the @NRCC’s entire recruitment effort across the country Rep. @SusanBrooksIN’s retirement is the clearest evidence yet that Washington Republicans’ efforts to retake the majority are in a tailspin. https://t.co/xdEfiWTUW3,2019-6-14 15:14:00,Twitter Web App,19,51
NRCC Chairman @tomemmer: you have my number and you know where to reach me.  There is no excuse for silence while our democracy is under attack.

President Trump and @NRCC Chairman @tomemmer both refuse to disavow the use of hacked and stolen materials -- a dangerous position that invites hostile foreign governments to interfere in our elections.
