Venezuela can’t even keep their lights on. This is what happens when government bureaucrats think they can run your life better than you can. #SocialismDoesntWork   https://t.co/hYAWDgbYGw,2019-03-13 01:18:07,Sprout Social,0,3
I had a great time at the Big 12 wrestling championship and even better time coaching at the WOW Duals going on at the same time!  It’s a blessing and an honor to sow into these young men and watch them develop as champions in life. #USAWrestling  https://t.co/qNAOhQMYkH,2019-03-12 21:17:59,Sprout Social,0,0
The “For the People Act” not only overturns laws in states that require identification to vote it also allows illegal aliens to vote in places like San Francisco. This was an easy “No” vote for me.  https://t.co/PnEGsbQvNh,2019-03-09 16:56:00,Sprout Social,0,2

Once again Rep. Ilhan Omar is in the news for making disgusting anti-Semitic comments. Her own party is now condemning her. There is no place for her anti-Semitic rhetoric and hate-speech in the United States Congress.  https://t.co/2aZoXO0U2y,2019-03-06 14:58:13,Sprout Social,0,1
I agree with POTUS that if Universities want federal research dollars then they need to support free speech. #MAGA,2019-03-03 17:11:16,Sprout Social,0,1
How many times is Ilhan Omar going to be criticized for making anti-Semitic remarks? It’s not like she’s hiding her true beliefs towards Jews.  https://t.co/tTsq9Pi9Rm,2019-03-03 02:24:04,Sprout Social,1,3
Her own daughter described her as someone that can cut your head off and you wouldn’t even feel it. Don’t be fooled Pelosi is just as extreme and dangerous as AOC. https://t.co/ffDOCqW3qk,2019-03-01 12:56:20,Sprout Social,1,0

Michael Cohen said today that he’s lied to Congress and that he’s not a liar. He’s the star witness of the Democratic-led Committee and is headed to prison a week from today. This man has zero credibility! The Democrats want to take down the President. https://t.co/d5A1HiUR4P,2019-02-27 17:44:57,Sprout Social,0,1
The liberal Democrats want the American people to believe socialism is the answer. It’s not! Just look at Venezuela.  I agree with Ivanka Trump that people want a chance to earn greatness. You deserve what you earn. https://t.co/VQyoJ6gdrY,2019-02-26 23:24:32,Sprout Social,0,1

How could anyone refer to the American flag as a ‘rag’. This type of talk needs to stop as it’s a total disgrace. I am proud of our country and the American flag. God bless America!  🇺🇸 https://t.co/521QcZekuM,2019-02-22 22:43:59,Sprout Social,1,2
