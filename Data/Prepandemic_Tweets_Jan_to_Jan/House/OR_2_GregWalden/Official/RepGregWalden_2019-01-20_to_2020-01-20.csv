Americans are consuming more cannabis &amp; policy decisions on this substance have been made in a virtual information vacuum.

This morning I handed out (normal) cookies in a @HouseCommerce hearing to raise awareness of the need for cannabis research.

The action of the House today plays into the hands of the Iranians who want us to leave the Middle East to them.
