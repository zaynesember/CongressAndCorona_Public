#MuellersReport did NOT investigate bigotry emanating from the Presidency harming our country. The findings do NOT negate the President’s bigotry. As long as bigotry influences the President’s policies I will continue to seek his impeachment. #ImpeachmentIsNotDead,2019-03-24 21:45:02,Twitter for iPhone,155,545

While my prayers are with the victims and their families of the mosque shooting in New Zealand condolences are not enough! ALL religions must organize against weaponized bigotry.

What happened to “give me your tired your poor your huddled masses yearning to breathe free?” Our country accommodated 12 million European asylees alone at Ellis Island from whom we have benefited.

When we allow bigotry to infect the body politic with impunity at the highest level other levels will expect impunity for their bigotry. Gov. Northam’s refusal to resign for his bigotry is a symptom.
