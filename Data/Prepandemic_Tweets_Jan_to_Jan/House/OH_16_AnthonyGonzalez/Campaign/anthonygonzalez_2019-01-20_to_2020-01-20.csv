@LtningSams The thing that’s so crazy to me is how many people in the organization had to be involved or at least knew about it -manager coaches video team and players. That’s why I’m so baffled they still have their title. It’s full-org cheating,2020-01-17 01:13:34,Twitter for iPhone,1,7

@jake_burns18 Schematically this is exactly the type of offense we should be running. Run-first/play-play action pass happy. It fits our skill perfectly. Baker needs to clean up his play-action technique we need help on the oline etc. But there are plenty of reasons to be excited.,2020-01-13 14:43:45,Twitter for iPhone,2,40
@IngramScott8 Agree on the character front. BUT  Chubb has more yards in 2 years than Cook does in 3.   OBJ &amp; Juice are better players than Diggs and Thielen.   Rudolph is the only maybe for me.   Agree Cousins is currently better than Baker but Baker has more talent. Just one man’s opinion.,2020-01-12 23:49:21,Twitter for iPhone,0,10
Seems this is the minority opinion but I believe we’re going to end up loving Stefanski. With far inferior talent he had the Vikings offense at 11th this year.   I don’t think they have a single skill position player that would start on our team. Go Browns!,2020-01-12 23:29:47,Twitter for iPhone,13,121

You are 100% right on who is paying. The financial transaction tax is a tax on pensioners and 401-k holders. These taxes are NOT paid by hedge fund/mutual fund managers.
