Just voted in favor of a bipartisan bill denouncing the anti-Israel BDS movement that seeks to undermine and delegitimize the state of Israel. The U.S. stands with Israel and against anti-semitism of any kind.,2019-07-23 23:34:00,Twitter Web App,18,161

Yesterday we had a good hearing with David Marcus where we expressed our many concerns with the Libra project. The appropriate thing to do would be to bring Marcus back in to update us on progress.

Please read my colleague’s statement. We may disagree on policy but his assessment of the state of Congress today is spot on and I appreciate his words today.

While I disagree passionately with many of my colleagues on substantive policy issues the comments from @POTUS yesterday were wildly inappropriate.

I also had an amendment included in the bill that directs @DeptofDefense to take steps to identify and address manipulated media content like "deepfakes" that puts our national security at risk. Looking forward to pushing for the inclusion of this and SASTA in the final #NDAA,2019-07-12 20:35:57,Twitter Web Client,0,3
My #SASTA legislation was one of the provisions included. Universities throughout Ohio are doing cutting edge research which has made them a target for nations like China who are actively stealing our research. My bill works to address this and keep our universities safe.,2019-07-12 20:30:08,Twitter Web Client,0,5
The House is currently voting on the #NDAA and while I'm voting no because it fails to adequately support our national defense at a time when we should be bolstering it I am encouraged to see two of my provisions included.

In Ohio alone over 152000 jobs remain available. These are untapped opportunities for our students &amp; workers. The #JOBSAct is critical to providing NE Ohioans who don’t want to pursue a traditional degree an opportunity to advance their careers and achieve a better future.,2019-06-26 18:52:18,Twitter Web Client,0,8
Today I introduced the #JOBSAct in the House with @RepRichmond @HerreraBeutler @RepAndyLevin @RepJohnKatko &amp; @RepHorsford to expand access to financial aid for technical education programs and help close the skills gap in communities like NEO. https://t.co/EdxA6yt1bW,2019-06-26 18:52:03,Twitter Web Client,2,13

I made the case again in @FinancialCmte that #USMCA is a clear win for our economy - especially for farmers and manufacturers. It's been a brutal year for Ohio farmers and this deal would give them stability and market access they badly need. It's time to get this done. https://t.co/eor8i0vasS,2019-06-20 20:49:19,Twitter Web Client,13,56
I believe passing USMCA is the single most important near-term piece of legislation Congress realistically can pass between now and the end of the year. If you haven't seen it yet read more about my stance on #USMCA in my @CantonRepdotcom op-ed here: https://t.co/72gKrab5aI,2019-06-20 20:01:36,Twitter Web Client,5,9
Could not agree more with @GovMikeDeWine. #USMCA gives manufacturers a chance to grow in communities like ours in NEO &amp; provides certainty and better market access for Ohio farmers. Ohioans need a trade agreement that will protect our industries and our values - USMCA does that. https://t.co/SGjj72zn2k,2019-06-20 19:57:47,Twitter Web Client,1,17

Had a great visit to @ua_legion808 today to talk about how the organization assists student veterans through peer support and connection to services.

Just cosponsored the End Government Shutdowns Act. There is a lot that Congress disagrees on but we should all be able to come together on the fact that the Washington dysfunction that lead to this shutdown is absolutely inexcusable. https://t.co/zCbmafO84R,2019-01-29 19:20:28,TweetDeck,6,34

Congress has a choice: We either come together and negotiate a solution to this #shutdown ourselves or we continue to sit by as more problems emerge. Day 34 and we still have not had a single substantive discussion. This is beyond unacceptable. Our constituents deserve better!,2019-01-25 17:39:40,TweetDeck,1,51
