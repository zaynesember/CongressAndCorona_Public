And let me share a little secret from talking to thousands of voters -   THEY KNOW TAXES ARE NOT UNCOMMON IN NEW YORK STATE.    Especially from Dems like #TaxinTedra https://t.co/cqE5F4XlLF,2020-01-16 21:57:53,Twitter for iPhone,75,368
This is a new one from the #NY21 #TaxinTedra apologist outlet.   Her tax hikes somehow don’t count because they are not “uncommon.” 🧐  I didn’t call her #UnCommonTaxinTedra just plain ol’ #TaxinTedra because she raised taxes multiple times as your outlet reported. https://t.co/cqE5F4XlLF,2020-01-16 21:56:03,Twitter for iPhone,88,410
Great article by @EllenforAustin in @RealClearNews about amazing conservative women as we work to engage empower elevate and elect #GOPWomen in 2020! #EPAC 🙋🏻‍♀️🙋🏼‍♀️🙋🏿‍♀️🙋🏽‍♀️🙋‍♀️🙋🏾‍♀️https://t.co/wc8LxQ9DMm,2020-01-16 21:20:11,Twitter for iPhone,84,339
So #Taxin’Tedra is accurate because she has indeed raised taxes.  Then I anticipate that you will report that “#TaxinTedra” is an accurate reflection of her tax hiking votes.   Whether 7 or 20. They are tax hike votes hence #TaxinTedra which fits like a 🧤 https://t.co/FLXW4KPVuD,2020-01-16 19:41:35,Twitter for iPhone,81,308
This took me exactly 2 seconds to find to use as an example.   @ncpr reporter saying our claim that #TaxinTedra has voted to raise taxes (and has also supported increased federal taxes) is false.   Your reporter falsely replied “factually inaccurate.”   Needs to be corrected. https://t.co/PCP3QbZtL0 https://t.co/mJlpKJFwaJ,2020-01-16 19:38:20,Twitter for iPhone,79,202
Classic #TaxinTedra #NY21 trainwreck.  Remember her viral gun ban video?  Now she's caught refusing to call Soleimani a terrorist.  But this time she’s asking you to WATCH.  Worst. Candidate. In.

Reporting that confirms #TaxinTedra did in fact RAISE taxes 7x  I expect retractions and corrections on the absolutely false articles and tweets this year claiming #TaxinTedra never raised taxes. https://t.co/jQQjioPrtP,2020-01-16 19:12:19,Twitter for iPhone,163,470
This is a reminder to reporters who inaccurately defend Tedra Cobb claiming she has never raised taxes.   Your own reporting shows otherwise &amp; all those articles where you falsely claim that she has never raised taxes needs to be retracted or corrected. @ncpr @davidncpr,2020-01-16 18:08:29,Twitter for iPhone,46,219
As I always said the name #TaxinTedra fits like a glove. 🧤  Because most importantly voters in St Lawrence County deeply understand and know she raised taxes. Which is why she lost &amp; why St Lawrence County Leg flipped.  I would love to keep talking about this until November.,2020-01-16 18:08:29,Twitter for iPhone,44,224
Very helpful to us when #NY21 reporters keep the discussion on Taxin’ Tedra.   In your OWN reporting you fact check TRUE that she raised taxes.   You disagree w/ the number of times.   You confirm she did in fact RAISE taxes 7x.  Tax tax tax tax tax tax Taxin’ T!,2020-01-16 18:08:28,Twitter for iPhone,139,575
Wow! Can’t make this up.   Thank you thank you #Taxin Tedra for encouraging #NY21 voters to watch this video. 🙌  We agree!👏   We’ll make sure every voter sees this over &amp; over &amp; over again.

Don’t worry Taxin’ Tedra! No amount of tweets will clean up this👇  🚨WATCH🚨 After REFUSING to support the strike thank our troops and call Soleimani a Terrorist in her official statement she AGAIN refuses to call him a terrorist!

Soleimani is a terrorist who has the blood of hundreds of Americans troops on his hands.   He is responsible for the loss of hundreds of American lives &amp; thousands wounded.   This is not a difficult question for any American let alone a candidate for the United States Congress.,2020-01-16 13:02:05,Twitter for iPhone,233,1344
🚨🚨In today’s #NY21 papers my opponent #TaxinTedra refuses to call Soleimani a terrorist.   #NY21 voters pressed her on why she wouldn’t call Soleimani a terrorist...  “Are you calling him a terrorist?”  Cobb did not respond &amp; moved on to the next question.
