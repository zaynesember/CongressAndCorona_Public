I will continue encouraging my colleagues to spend time talking to our Veterans and visiting the VA so that policies they push for reflect the needs of our nation’s heroes.,2019-04-24 21:02:34,Twitter for iPhone,1,5
We have Veterans in #MI01 who’ve waited nearly a decade for their appeals to be heard and others live hours from the closest VA facility.  Congress’ new reforms are bringing more accountability and access than ever to VA. No one in DC should feel satisfied with the status quo.,2019-04-24 21:02:33,Twitter for iPhone,0,9

A new Poe-sized Lock in the Soo has been a failed endeavor by politicians for decades that is no longer the case. Recently I led a letter with @RepMoolenaar and Rep.

Although this legislation includes the word bipartisan in the title it's just a far-left attack on those who legally own and utilize firearms.

I just voted in opposition to H.R. 8. This bill is so far out of the mainstream it would make borrowing a hunting rifle a felony and subject the lender to the same criminal penalties of those who purchase a firearm for a known dangerous criminal.   #2A #Support2A,2019-02-27 20:59:17,Twitter for iPhone,19,54

Instead of working towards a compromise to open the government and secure our border the Speaker is canceling session and barring @POTUS from delivering the State of the Union address at the Capitol. This is nothing short of political theater. Our constituents deserve better!,2019-01-24 13:43:34,Twitter for iPhone,6,16
Democrat leadership in the House would do well to focus as much energy on opening the government as they are on keeping @realDonaldTrump from delivering his State of the Union address.,2019-01-24 13:43:34,Twitter for iPhone,15,43
