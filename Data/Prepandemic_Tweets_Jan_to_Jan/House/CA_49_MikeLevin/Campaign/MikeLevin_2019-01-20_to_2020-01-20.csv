Thanks to all who attended our Town Hall in Carlsbad tonight and for your terrific questions and comments!  We’ve had 13 town halls in 13 months I’ve been in Congress.   I’ll do one a month for as long as I’m honored to serve. #CA49 @townhallproject https://t.co/OVi3t8zgRw,2020-01-18 03:32:56,Twitter for iPhone,27,134

Trump might be handing our environmental agencies to fossil fuel lobbyists and destroying decades of bipartisan environmental protections but we Californians aren’t having any of it!  I’ll fight for our state every way I can as long as I’m in Congress. https://t.co/6PJgvFwMdL,2020-01-17 19:06:39,Twitter for iPhone,31,115
With all this week’s other news we must not overlook that Trump’s corrupt EPA which should now call itself the Environmental Pollution Agency is trying to gut protections for clean water sending decades of bipartisan progress literally down the drain. https://t.co/jaNwxVsTkm,2020-01-17 13:39:52,Twitter for iPhone,485,561
This is a big deal.  The nonpartisan Government Accountability Office says the Trump Administration broke the law by withholding Congressionally approved aid to Ukraine.  https://t.co/VZAsGcvZhD,2020-01-16 15:15:12,Twitter for iPhone,1145,3636
Very pleased that today the Senate will pass the USMCA trade deal with Mexico and Canada approved by the House last month.  It includes $300M I fought for to help with Tijuana River Valley pollution.

Senators owe it to their oath of office and the Constitution to consider as much evidence as possible to objectively decide Trump’s case. This was true before Lev Parnas’ interview last night but became even clearer after hearing the information he provided.,2020-01-16 12:26:15,Twitter for iPhone,72,304
Worth repeating: “The president’s tweet is not only untrue but it misrepresents his administration’s efforts to repeal the health care law without offering any replacement that might maintain its core protections. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.” https://t.co/aFH8WnOjCt,2020-01-15 23:31:15,Twitter for iPhone,203,316
One homeless veteran is one too many.  I won’t stop fighting to eliminate veteran homelessness.  Thanks @fox5sandiego for covering my House Veterans Affairs’ Subcommittee hearing on the issue yesterday. https://t.co/KZCQiBagOz,2020-01-15 16:58:48,Twitter for iPhone,13,52

One homeless veteran is one too many. No one who sacrifices so much to serve our country should ever have to worry about having a place to live.  Thanks @KUSINews for covering my House Veterans Affairs’ Subcommittee hearing on the issue today. https://t.co/Ctg5G6cimT,2020-01-14 23:15:39,Twitter for iPhone,24,65
Today I led another hearing on veteran homelessness including local experts from #CA49.   No one who sacrifices so much for our country should worry about having a place to live.  We are making progress but one homeless veteran is one too many.  https://t.co/v4Wou9I9Zw,2020-01-14 18:29:34,Twitter for iPhone,22,57
This administration has tried to rip away healthcare protections for those with pre-existing conditions.   We’ve had to fight back at every turn.  Even for a president who has a casual relationship with the truth these claims are completely ridiculous.  https://t.co/vaqMlMgqzZ,2020-01-14 14:14:59,Twitter for iPhone,143,279
We shouldn’t allow a single veteran in need to go hungry.  Ever.  Men and women of extraordinary character serve our country and sacrifice for our national security.  The least we can do is provide them with food security.  Thanks @fox5sandiego for covering my recent hearing. https://t.co/di6HvFpWAA,2020-01-13 21:01:20,Twitter for iPhone,34,138
Don’t believe Trump’s lies today claiming he fought to protect pre-existing conditions. He and the GOP have tried to gut these and other protections of the Affordable Care Act both in Congress and in the courts.

Trump who has been an environmental disaster says he’s reading a book to learn about climate change.  Turns out the book is called “Donald J. Trump: An Environmental Hero.”  Honestly cannot make this stuff up.  https://t.co/OPBVD1OvBW,2020-01-12 00:06:59,Twitter for iPhone,902,2364

The Senate has conducted 15 impeachment trials in American history.   It heard witnesses in every one.   That’s what a trial is.   #DefendOurDemocracy,2020-01-10 21:53:06,Twitter for iPhone,282,828
Trump’s attack on decades of bipartisan environmental policy is stunning. In all my years as an attorney and clean energy advocate I never expected to see a president of either party that would ignore science and disregard common sense to this extent. https://t.co/pg18MKsGts,2020-01-10 02:02:25,Twitter for iPhone,275,456
I would like to thank all of the incredible men and women of law enforcement in #CA49 and across the country who work selflessly every day to keep us safe as well as the amazing families who support them.   #NationalLawEnforcementAppreciationDay,2020-01-10 00:38:57,Twitter for iPhone,10,50
We are not safer as a result of this administration’s recklessness.    We have avoided war with Iran at least for now. But it is a conflict Trump has made much worse.  This is a time for Congress to reassert its Constitutional responsibility as a coequal branch of government.,2020-01-09 13:55:23,Twitter for iPhone,136,526
I believe more than ever that this administration has no clear consistent strategy to deal with Iran.    Abandoning the Iran Deal hasn’t worked.    “Maximum pressure” hasn’t worked.  More of the same won’t work.  What is the endgame?,2020-01-08 22:30:17,Twitter for iPhone,97,485

The stakes in the Middle East are far too high to be “winging it” with a foreign policy in total disarray.  Congress and the American people need to know: what is the strategy to de-escalate this conflict?  https://t.co/EuDw2hWmzC,2020-01-07 16:19:53,Twitter for iPhone,74,180

The Trump administration needs to provide every member of Congress with a comprehensive briefing on military engagement related to Iran and next steps under consideration.  What is the strategy to de-escalate this conflict?  Also threatening tweets aren’t a strategy.,2020-01-05 18:12:49,Twitter for iPhone,110,441
I am proud to cosponsor the Prevention of Unconstitutional War with Iran Act of 2019 (H.R. 2354) which would prohibit funds from being used for kinetic military operations against Iran unless Congress authorizes such an action. We must take action to prevent an unnecessary war.,2020-01-04 19:07:37,Twitter for iPhone,656,2003
Truth: “The Trump administration has so far provided scant information... regarding the factual and legal bases underlying the strike. With a potentially grave eruption looming Congress and the public deserve answers to important questions.” https://t.co/RgBb95CQb8,2020-01-03 23:52:32,Twitter for iPhone,61,152
Events of the past day make it clear that we are long overdue for a new Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF).  The current AUMF is too broad and we cannot give Trump or any president a blank check to get us into unnecessary conflict without Congressional authorization.,2020-01-03 16:13:08,Twitter for iPhone,193,530
These new unredacted documents make it clearer than ever that the Ukraine aid freeze was intended to coerce interference in the 2020 election to help Trump.  What else is @realDonaldTrump hiding?

Mitch McConnell and the Senate have a constitutional obligation to hold a fair trial. That means a process worthy of the significance of what’s at stake — including hearing from witnesses and pursuing evidence Trump has withheld.   No one is above the law not even the President.,2019-12-31 21:36:30,Twitter for iPhone,106,412

Truth: “Trump and McConnell don’t want a Senate trial that includes the handful of witnesses that Democrats have demanded because Trump is flagrantly guilty of all of the corruption for which he’s now been impeached.”  https://t.co/tsKbaSvote,2019-12-30 20:50:11,Twitter for iPhone,303,818

US mass killings reached a record high in 2019 — guns were used in the vast majority of them.  Almost a year ago the House passed common sense gun safety legislation HR 8 and HR 1112.   McConnell hasn’t allowed a vote on either bill. Enough is enough.  https://t.co/sJscnLrHR8,2019-12-29 19:07:57,Twitter for iPhone,1098,1929
I was proud to cosponsor legislation to repeal the unfair $10000 cap on the State and Local Tax Deduction which was designed to punish California.  Now Mitch McConnell must allow the Senate to proceed with a vote on this important bill! https://t.co/JC3Qw7IUkM,2019-12-28 17:18:03,Twitter for iPhone,67,319

My mom’s parents came from Mexico as young children.   While they passed away some years ago I’m sure they heard the occasional call to “go back” to where they came from.

The political career of @realDonaldTrump began with birtherism and xenophobia.

The claims against the Virginia Lt. Gov. are credible and devastating.  I believe the survivors.  There is absolutely no room in our society for sexual assault or violence.,2019-02-09 00:59:18,Twitter for iPad,69,516
Honored to be part of the new House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis and excited to support a #GreenNewDeal.  It’s time for bold steps to #ActOnClimate!  https://t.co/wdDIe4Q7vW,2019-02-08 22:19:24,Twitter for iPhone,34,129
ICYMI: I’m thrilled and honored to serve on the new House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis.  Our transition to a sustainable energy future is imperative and there’s no time to waste.  Let’s get to work!  https://t.co/himtpjevWS,2019-02-08 00:17:58,Twitter for iPhone,58,322

Calls for unity and bipartisanship are great — but the real issue is how the president will act when the TelePrompTer is turned off. https://t.co/gjhl4zZq1c,2019-02-06 16:59:58,Twitter for iPhone,14,56
Unbelievable that @realDonaldTrump claimed to care about protecting coverage for those with pre-existing conditions at the same time his administration is behind a lawsuit trying to eliminate those same protections — the height of hypocrisy!,2019-02-06 14:19:17,Twitter for iPhone,232,627
Last night @realDonaldTrump called for compromise but only on his terms.  That’s not compromise.,2019-02-06 11:57:22,Twitter for iPhone,261,2160
Nice to see @realDonaldTrump wants to talk about “unity” at the #SOTU tonight.  But we need more than empty rhetoric.  If he wants to unite he needs to use the next two weeks to negotiate across the aisle in good faith  rather than threaten shutdowns or emergency declarations.,2019-02-05 23:05:38,Twitter for iPhone,461,2191
This president has empowered big polluters as never before:  -Former oil lobbyist nominated to run Dept of Interior  -Former coal lobbyist runs the EPA  -Rick Perry runs the Dept of Energy (the same guy who wanted to eliminate the agency but couldn’t remember its name... oops),2019-02-05 16:08:01,Twitter for iPhone,1845,4652
A worst-case scenario nuclear disaster at San Onofre would be devastating for millions of people.  We cannot allow the status quo to continue indefinitely which is why we must find new solutions to deal with the grave safety challenges we face. https://t.co/h9tEF1iQFl,2019-02-05 01:29:20,Twitter for iPhone,48,139
Trump just named former oil lobbyist David Bernhardt as the new head of the Department of Interior — continuing an unprecedented culture of corruption and cronyism cramming the Cabinet full of lobbyists who are using their power to enrich themselves and their industries. Enough!,2019-02-04 21:15:26,Twitter for iPhone,1305,2587
Last week our country witnessed five mass shootings in just five days.  These tragedies barely made headlines.   It goes to show how desensitized our society has become to the growing gun violence epidemic and how desperately we in Congress need to take action to reverse course.,2019-02-04 17:26:11,Twitter for iPhone,3716,10386
I grew up cheering for the LA Rams.  Excited to watch them in the #SuperBowl today! https://t.co/k2Bg1ymhyR,2019-02-03 15:12:27,Twitter for iPhone,13,127
I miss having a president who didn’t consistently display “willful ignorance” https://t.co/if0AkJeLz6,2019-02-03 01:26:33,Twitter for iPhone,402,1881
We cannot tolerate racist behavior anywhere. The Governor of Virginia needs to step aside. I join those calling for his resignation.,2019-02-02 03:58:47,Twitter for iPhone,142,819
Our global leadership is in disarray.  We abandon the Paris Accord + the Iran Deal (just confirmed to be working by our own Intelligence).  Now we abandon the INF Treaty — a legacy of Reagan.  Now Russia is unconstrained and can build as many INF-violating missiles as they want.,2019-02-01 17:43:35,Twitter for iPhone,173,373
@MelissaJPeltier @TrueFactsStated Fair enough!,2019-02-01 16:04:45,Twitter for iPhone,0,23
To recap here’s what Trump’s intel chiefs said in part:  -We have not defeated ISIS. -Climate change is very real. -North Korea still presents a nuclear threat. -Russia is meddling in our elections.  They were NOT misquoted.,2019-02-01 14:22:05,Twitter for iPhone,1706,5025
@danrsena @dccc @repbenraylujan @SpeakerPelosi Thank you for your hard work Dan!,2019-02-01 13:41:07,Twitter for iPhone,0,2
Encouraging those who are legally eligible to vote is not a power grab.    Continued efforts by @senatemajldr McConnell and others to suppress voting rights is a power grab.,2019-01-31 16:44:11,Twitter for iPhone,871,2806
Yesterday @HouseDemocrats passed legislation giving the whole federal civilian workforce a raise.    Meanwhile Trump and McConnell continue using these same workers as political pawns threatening another shutdown if they don’t get their way.  The contrast is obvious.,2019-01-31 14:19:08,Twitter for iPhone,183,489
Today I was proud to support a resolution that “Government shutdowns are detrimental to the Nation and should not occur.”  Amazingly 163 Republicans voted against the resolution — admitting they don’t mind shutdowns or taking full ownership of them.,2019-01-30 22:43:18,Twitter for iPhone,2454,5491

Acting EPA administrator Andrew Wheeler should not be confirmed.  He won’t set limits for toxic chemicals in drinking water or admit the horrible impact of mercury emissions from coal plants.  He’s nothing more than the pawn of big polluters.  Enough is enough.,2019-01-30 17:25:23,Twitter for iPhone,219,575
No @realDonaldTrump you don’t know more than your intel chiefs and you don’t know more than the generals either.,2019-01-30 14:49:40,Twitter for iPhone,2975,14631
Reminder: a disagreement over policy is never a reason to shut down the government.,2019-01-30 01:57:13,Twitter for iPhone,164,1081
The consequences of climate change have become impossible to ignore.  We cannot continue to deny the obvious — and this is no time for half measures.,2019-01-29 14:40:01,Twitter for iPhone,85,494
According to the nonpartisan @USCBO the #TrumpShutdown cost our economy $11 billion — $3 billion of which was lost FOREVER.  @realDonaldTrump needs to stop threatening the American people to get his way.,2019-01-28 20:00:33,Twitter for iPad,69,182
This week @HouseDemocrats will support legislation giving the whole federal civilian workforce a raise.    Meanwhile Trump will be using these same workers as his political pawns threatening another shutdown if he doesn’t get his way.  The contrast couldn’t be more obvious.,2019-01-28 18:52:20,Twitter for iPad,733,2424
The Trump Administration’s denial of climate science is appalling.  We’ve gone from a leader on reducing greenhouse gas emissions to a global laughingstock.  Our planet deserves better.    Good news: 2020 will be here soon enough. https://t.co/1qUYGQsShA,2019-01-28 15:50:13,Twitter for iPhone,53,169
The House of Representatives is the people’s house.    I’m so honored to represent the great people of #CA49 and thankful for the large crowd that came to our first monthly town hall yesterday.

800000 federal workers had to suffer for no reason.  We cannot allow @realDonaldTrump or any president to shut down the government every time there’s a disagreement.,2019-01-26 17:23:39,Twitter for iPhone,425,1996
Excited to announce a new Task Force to address the nuclear waste in our community.  We can’t allow the status quo to continue indefinitely. https://t.co/q3VX3Sdg6P,2019-01-26 04:26:08,Twitter for iPhone,124,606

Sad that it took 35 days of inflicting pain and misery on our federal workers for Trump and McConnell to come to their senses.,2019-01-25 20:52:41,Twitter for iPhone,969,6796

Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross who is a billionaire himself says federal employees should just get loans during the shutdown... while his agency’s own credit union is charging “rates as low as 8.99%.”  He’s almost as out of touch with impacted federal workers as his boss.,2019-01-24 23:04:10,Twitter for iPhone,912,3375
I’ve now voted ELEVEN TIMES to re-open the govt — to no avail thanks to McConnell and Trump.  If you’re an impacted federal employee I am so sorry.  We won’t stop fighting.,2019-01-24 21:18:09,Twitter for iPhone,2726,9433
Fines against big polluters by the Environmental Protection Agency have fallen by 85 PERCENT under the Trump Administration.    That’s what happens when big polluters are in charge.  They might as well start calling it the Environmental Pollution Agency.  https://t.co/zzvRne2sDO,2019-01-24 14:52:31,Twitter for iPhone,109,186
We can and should debate comprehensive immigration reform and border security without putting hundreds of thousands of Americans and millions of families in financial turmoil. Anything else is irresponsible and downright shameful.,2019-01-24 01:29:00,Twitter for iPhone,109,380
