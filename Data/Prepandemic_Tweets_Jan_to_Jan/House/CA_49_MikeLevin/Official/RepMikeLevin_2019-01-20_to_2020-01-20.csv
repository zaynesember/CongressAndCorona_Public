Here’s what @realDonaldTrump's reckless tariffs against Mexico would mean for San Diego:  An extra $17 million tax on imported goods in June An extra $34 million tax in July An extra $51 million tax in August  And that's just imports from Baja to our region. You get the picture.,2019-06-03 20:15:04,Twitter Web Client,31,61
Americans are going to pay for @realDonaldTrump's senseless tariffs not Mexico.    We’re going to pay more for everything from vegetables to spark plugs.

For every student admitted as part of the #CollegeCheatingScandal another hard-working student was unfairly denied entry to the university of their dreams.

I strongly support Governor @GavinNewsom’s decision to place a moratorium on the state's death penalty. Capital punishment is deeply flawed and antithetical to our values. I’m especially proud to be a Californian today.,2019-03-13 14:41:57,Twitter Web Client,17,128
Spending $230000 in taxpayer money for consultants to read emails is unacceptable. We need greater oversight of agencies like TCA that allowed this to happen. https://t.co/sv1zskhEV1,2019-03-13 01:40:54,Twitter for iPhone,8,16

Just voted to reject the president’s #FakeEmergency. It’s an abuse of power that could rip nearly $124 million from Camp Pendleton for critical military construction projects.   This isn’t about partisanship it’s about patriotism.,2019-02-26 23:40:48,Twitter Web Client,42,314

I also continue to have serious concerns about this Administration’s asylum policies which do not live up to our nation’s principles.,2019-02-23 01:01:34,Twitter for iPhone,13,42
Just visited the San Ysidro Port of Entry at our border with Mexico and saw recent upgrades to the facility.

This is stunning. The president picked a climate change denier who thinks pollution is good for the planet to lead a panel studying climate change.    He once said “warming and increased CO2 will be good for mankind.”   This is a new low in the Administration's war on science. https://t.co/ueMzAFXIy9,2019-02-21 22:00:26,Twitter Web Client,149,384
