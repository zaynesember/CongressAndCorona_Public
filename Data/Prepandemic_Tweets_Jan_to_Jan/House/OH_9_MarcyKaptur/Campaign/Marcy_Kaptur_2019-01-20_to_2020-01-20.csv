We pray for the men women and children put at risk by the President's unilateral action. The Trump Administration must immediately work to deescalate tensions. No more endless wars. #NoWarWithIran,2020-01-04 00:30:43,TweetDeck,1,5
President Trump is guilty of abusing his power by strengthening liberty’s adversary. He has obstructed Congress in his failure to comply with lawful subpoenas. His actions subvert US national security by emboldening Vladimir Putin. I am voting to impeach. https://t.co/0wzZqy77Qj,2019-12-18 19:39:42,TweetDeck,25,99
Mr. President that plant opened in 2013.   Additionally I hosted an important hearing about the Department of Energy's role in combating climate change in our extremely open congress. I believe another hearing with one of your donors also made news.  https://t.co/RvPqN4q1Ir https://t.co/jCAKg9m59m,2019-11-20 23:51:49,TweetDeck,3,7
Wonderful news to see Cleveland rise in the rankings as a Welcoming City for immigrants. Our communities are richer our bonds stronger when we accept and welcome our neighbor. https://t.co/ZDyP37WvS5,2019-11-13 20:01:11,TweetDeck,2,7
Thank you Senator Klobuchar for visiting Toledo and sharing your vision. Ahead of this week's presidential debate in Ohio it's so important that we explain to voters the positive impact sensible policies can have on our communities. https://t.co/TAg0cC5Joa,2019-10-12 18:42:18,TweetDeck,27,59
I had the privilege of meeting this young man at a community meeting in Toledo. What a treasure. We're proud of you Jaden! https://t.co/ohEdUb95PQ,2019-10-01 17:34:05,TweetDeck,1,10
This is a tremendous step forward for our Cleveland community. Families need a stable home and we need to continue to work to make that a reality. Thank you to the advocates who have worked to make this happen. https://t.co/DAr6dipnhG,2019-10-01 01:31:05,TweetDeck,4,23

I want to thank the @washingtonpost for visiting the 9th Congressional District and meeting those who live and work here. Whether it's a weatherized home or community garden we can deliver for working Americans. https://t.co/OtaeILDY3o,2019-08-27 00:33:04,TweetDeck,2,6
What conclusion are we supposed to draw from this type of behavior? How are Americans supposed to feel that their elections are free and fair? https://t.co/WzvAJgkCMc,2019-07-25 20:07:46,TweetDeck,0,2
Congratulations and thanks for everything you do for the community. I can't wait to come by for a slice! https://t.co/UyegHlauXG,2019-07-20 01:48:51,TweetDeck,2,9
Wonderful to join @RashidaTlaib yesterday for a tour of Detroit's Tiny Homes community. What I saw was a passionate community coming together with creative housing solutions that can build wealth and help residents escape the poverty cycle. https://t.co/hCtOuhYkqn,2019-07-16 15:56:49,TweetDeck,3,0
This is outrageous. The American people deserve transparency from drug companies on why prescription drug prices are so high. Republicans urging companies to avoid cooperating with congress is a new low. https://t.co/dtON8vvxaZ,2019-04-09 14:06:45,TweetDeck,1,3
President Trump couldn't kick Americans with pre-existing conditions off their healthcare plans through congress so now his administration is hoping the courts do it for him. Imagine if we worked together to pass universal comprehensive health coverage. https://t.co/o3eq4fELMa,2019-03-26 15:09:30,TweetDeck,0,1
