@TexMexV AMERICA got Bin Laden! It wasn’t Obama or Bush - it was our military Special Forces intelligence &amp; dogged perseverance for 10 years through 2 Admins that got Bin Laden. Bush found Bin Laden’s courier &amp; Obama used SEALS instead of bombs to ensure a kill. GOD BLESS AMERICA!,2019-09-12 01:55:37,Twitter for iPad,1,1
Final September 11 memory. Fellow Texan #GeorgeWBush had been #POTUS for 234 short days. Like FDR after Pearl Harbor he knew our world had changed. Fear plagued America. We needed a leader so he went to #GroundZero &amp; grabbed a bullhorn. https://t.co/FM4SDPrm1U via @YouTube,2019-09-12 01:38:23,Twitter for iPad,0,5

Timely #September11 meeting about our #TX22 first responders today with @MissouriCityTX City Manager Anthony Snipes in my DC office.

7 years ago today September 11 2012 religious fanatics planned &amp; attacked our personnel in Benghazi. We lost Ambassador #ChrisStevens #SeanSmith #TyroneWoods &amp; #GlenDoherty.

Another example of heroism &amp; sacrifice at #TwinTowers on 9/11/2001. God was there through #NYFD Chaplain Mychal Judge. Firefighters ran into buildings that were about to fall. Mychal was there to serve them as they needed in horrific conditions. He never fled &amp; died serving God. https://t.co/xdU5OB061D,2019-09-11 16:03:47,Twitter for iPad,6,10
Meet Heather “Lucky” Penney. F16 pilot at Andrews AFB on 9/11/2001. After the #TwinTowers &amp; #Pentagon  were hit she was launched to intercept United 93. I saw her zip over the #Capitol. She had to take off w/o any weapons - ordered to crash into UA 93! American Kamikaze &amp; Hero. https://t.co/AlN6l5VfRD,2019-09-11 12:18:12,Twitter for iPad,30,45
@njz0428 And you lose your bet big time.  The liberal Washington Post celebrated Heather’s courage. https://t.co/VKtFyu11Vi,2019-09-11 11:29:24,Twitter for iPad,0,0
On 9/11/2001 I was at work in DC for Sen Phil Gramm on Capitol Hill. 2 hijacked planes had hit the #TwinTowers. At 9:38am I saw a plume of black smoke from the #Pentagon. American Airlines 77 had hit it. I had passed it 1 hour before. War had come to my family &amp; all America. https://t.co/AxbKZrxnTN,2019-09-11 00:02:17,Twitter for iPad,357,1416

I spoke in strong opposition to the anti-American #Energy bills coming to the House floor this week. I strongly oppose #HR205 which would ban energy development in parts of the Gulf of Mexico — no no and NO. American energy = American security. https://t.co/qbWC28TS3p,2019-09-10 18:07:30,Twitter Web App,4,15
The #BornAliveAct is common-sense legislation that protects the most vulnerable of the most vulnerable. When a child is born it deserves care — period. It’s time for House Democrats to stop stalling and bring this bill up for the vote it deserves. https://t.co/hvfFC5VAAP,2019-09-10 17:04:45,Twitter Web App,2,0

@Egil_Skallagrim @FormerUSN Happy 102nd for your Dad! He &amp; the Greatest Generation saved our world. The HELENA was the first ship hit at Pearl Harbor - was Dad aboard at that time?

@Egil_Skallagrim @FormerUSN W/o the #DoolittleRaid Japan may have won WW2. 64 bombs did minor damage EXCEPT to Japanese invincibility. For the 1st time in 1000 years a foreign nation hit their soil. They needed a fight to sink our carriers. We gave them that fight at Midway. No Doolittle no Midway.,2019-09-08 12:14:16,Twitter for iPad,1,1

#OTD in 1915 an American hero Lt. Col. Dick Cole was born. I was proud to call him a friend and sad when he passed away earlier this year.
