We have to fight for rural hospitals!  I must say the Hillsboro community packs a punch when it comes to making sure their hospital stays open!

Women will die from this very dangerous procedure. The late-term abortion process that New York passed into law is inhumane. The further along in a pregnancy the more risk from complications come with an abortion procedure.https://t.co/0ca9YwUWmo,2019-02-13 15:37:04,Twitter Web App,22,47

Unreal. It is clear that Dem leadership has gone off the rails. Now saying a 3yr DACA extension isn’t a fair deal for border security?
