President @realdonaldtrump wanted to get to the bottom of the corruption between Joe and Hunter Biden Burisma and Ukraine.   We need to know how the former Vice President got a prosecutor fired and got his son a job w/ Burisma while he was the nation's point person to Ukraine. https://t.co/AL6ag3voOQ,2019-12-12 20:15:14,Twitter Media Studio,1043,2200

1. Burisma had a reputation of being corrupt 2.

Looks like I got under Chairman Nadler’s skin today.  I reminded him of his 3-pronged test for an impeachment hearing &amp; Democrats have failed to meet each prong.

Instead of working on the real issues #DoNothingDemocrats are only focused on impeaching President @realDonaldTrump. Congress should pass the USMCA immediately. Arizona and the U.S. need the #USMCANow. https://t.co/aMmknhuS8N,2019-11-13 22:25:47,Twitter Web App,162,394
Currently in the room of the 1st public impeachment hearing after weeks of Adam Schiff conducting hearings behind closed doors.  Dems have wanted to remove Pres @realDonaldTrump since election day and they’re using a sham process with cherry-picked witnesses to try and do so https://t.co/wBKc9yLNRF,2019-11-13 17:26:22,Twitter Web App,105,280
Next up: Ambassador Bill Taylor.  Taylor has no first-hand knowledge meaning he was not present for any of the key phone calls or meetings that would allow him to corroborate the Democrats' allegations. https://t.co/B3E2Hd0Afa,2019-11-13 15:57:35,Twitter Web App,50,71
Kent also expressed concerns about Hunter Biden back in 2015 but was rebuffed.  Republicans asked for Hunter Biden to come testify. Adam Schiff refused. https://t.co/GKN4efgAuQ,2019-11-13 15:46:57,Twitter Web App,107,192
Deputy Assistant Secretary George Kent is providing his opening statement.   However Kent is not a direct witness and has stated he had no direct knowledge of U.S. aid ever being connected to opening an investigation. https://t.co/YRE1Y5ilG1,2019-11-13 15:39:08,Twitter Web App,54,85
As public hearings begin let's remember the facts:  -Transcript shows NO link to aid &amp; political investigations  -Aid released w/ out any commitment to new investigations  -Ukraine didn’t know aid was withheld during the call  -Pres. Trump &amp; Zelensky say there was ZERO pressure,2019-11-13 15:22:45,Twitter Web App,350,912
