Proud to be among the first members of Congress endorsed by @StopBigMoney. I'm proud to have run and won with grassroots support and without corporate PAC money.

Headed back to DC today with notes of encouragement from constituents to support H.R. 1 the #ForthePeople Act. It’s time to end corporate special interest influence and return the power of our democracy to the people. #NHPolitics https://t.co/kyDcrUxQB9,2019-03-05 22:20:37,Twitter for iPhone,16,66
There is building bipartisan opposition to President Trump's national emergency declaration and for good reason. It isn't just bad policy it is an unconstitutional end run around Congress that should not be allowed to stand. https://t.co/NxaLX94vui,2019-03-05 16:47:41,Twitter for iPhone,21,67
We must support trans youth. We cannot continue to allow school policies that tell students it's not okay to be who they are. Transgender equality is law in NH &amp; it should be federal law as well. https://t.co/OhF0tCI5VQ,2019-03-04 20:46:09,Twitter for iPhone,26,104
Celebrating the life of Dr. Seuss on his 115th birthday which is now 'Read Across America Day.' Recently I joined students in Exeter to celebrate his outstanding legacy which includes inspiring children to be excited about reading. https://t.co/a7VV7mwWw8,2019-03-02 17:22:59,Twitter for iPhone,7,54

My constituents are still feeling the sting of the recent government shutdown. Our communities shouldn’t be pawns in a political fight. I hope the far reaching impacts of this mess have made it clear that we should never engage in shutdown politics again. https://t.co/lNRmNtLQad,2019-02-27 16:58:34,Twitter for iPhone,1,8
THIS is the #CostOfInaction both in terms of repairing infrastructure and addressing climate change.

Capping out-of-pocket drug costs for Medicare recipients is necessary given the escalating burden seniors face. Every day I talk to constituents I hear about the need to address this now. https://t.co/gzXPMKfLtd,2019-02-25 17:27:29,Twitter for iPhone,1,7
The White House's "ad hoc working group" is simply an orchestrated excuse to ignore the clear climate science that tells us we urgently need bold action.   It's as much a sham as the Administration's now-disbanded voter fraud commission. https://t.co/7wvXojHeWs,2019-02-25 15:05:51,Twitter for iPhone,10,26
My three big takeaways from the first couple months in Congress: 1. This freshman class is ready to change Washington. 2. I'm serving with the best delegation in the U.S. with @JeanneShaheen @Maggie_Hassan &amp; @AnnMcLaneKuster. 3. If we stick together we can make things happen. https://t.co/XiW8EIFtGh,2019-02-23 15:43:59,Twitter for iPhone,26,164

Today the Trump Admin. decided to strip away #TitleX funding for health care providers that offer women basic family planning options &amp; educational information. This backwards policy is an affront to the health &amp; safety of our communities and we must fight it. https://t.co/mOdLskNZst,2019-02-22 21:23:04,Twitter for iPhone,59,150
This morning I was honored to congratulate 79 new American citizens at a naturalization ceremony in Concord.

Incredibly relieved to hear that the @NCSBE voted unanimously in favor of a new election in #NC09. The integrity of our elections and faith in the democratic process are more important than the victory of any candidate or party. https://t.co/wIqECxkC5m,2019-02-22 18:54:27,Twitter for iPhone,4,16
This afternoon I hosted a roundtable with transportation planners from around New Hampshire. As a member of the House T&amp;I Committee I’m eager to get to work addressing regional state and national infrastructural needs. https://t.co/Rm7vL2kMS5,2019-02-22 02:51:06,Twitter for iPhone,6,36

With the bipartisan compromise passed and the threat of another shutdown behind us it's time to get on with the people’s business.

This marks one year since 17 lives were tragically lost at Marjory Stoneman Douglas HS in #Parkland FL. Today we pause for a moment of remembrance.

This project by teen journalists is remarkable. In the 12 months since #Parkland 1200 American kids have been killed by guns. Teen journalists are telling 1200 stories about their lives. https://t.co/oPF96NSn2C,2019-02-13 16:44:41,Twitter for iPhone,265,363
It's pretty simple: "If you're fit to serve you should be able to serve however you identify."  Thanks again to Tavion for sharing his story &amp; helping us raise the injustice of the trans military service ban at the #SOTU. https://t.co/aSwxRhFZ2K,2019-02-12 15:54:10,Twitter for iPhone,20,75
This morning we kicked off ’Valentines for Veterans’ at Parker-Varney School with an amazing group of fourth graders.

29 years ago Nelson Mandela was freed from a jail cell after spending 27 years "prepared to die" for the cause of justice. His spirit perseverance and leadership changed the world.

We need to #Fight4HER which is why I co-sponsored the Global Health Empowerment and Rights (HER) Act which was introduced yesterday to end the Global Gag Rule. This rule makes women &amp; families around the world less healthy &amp; safe. https://t.co/FevzuDIKhG,2019-02-08 15:55:12,Twitter for iPhone,8,47

How can you possibly be so out of touch?

Two years ago today the Trump Admin reinstated the #GlobalGagRule denying family planning funds to organizations that inform women about all their options.
