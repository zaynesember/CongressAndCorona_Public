In order to prevent future shutdowns from hurting federal employees with student loans @RepAnnieKuster &amp; I wrote a letter to @BetsyDeVosED urging her to change the rules at @usedgov.

As an original co-sponsor of the #ShutdownToEndAllShutdowns (SEAS) Act preventing another shutdown from hurting federal employees &amp; critical services is a priority.

This morning on FDR’s bday we’re introducing the Social Security 2100 Act. As a co-sponsor of #Secure2100 I know we must live up to the promise our govt made to seniors &amp; those with disabilities through this foundational earned benefit. This bill makes it solvent through 2100. https://t.co/7krvkkqD1r,2019-01-30 18:41:38,Twitter for iPhone,24,74

This needless shutdown is now projected to cost the American economy $3 billion. It's time to end shutdown politics and focus on how we can work together to adopt policies that will grow our economy and help New Hampshire families get ahead. https://t.co/NaBO33EMrW,2019-01-29 18:56:41,Twitter Web Client,6,16

It's inexplicable that the EPA charged w/ protecting the public refuses to set limits for chemicals in drinking water. The study they tried to withhold last year shows these chemicals as hazardous at low levels. We need stringent national standards to safeguard drinking water. https://t.co/aPTKQ95AJs,2019-01-29 18:00:17,Twitter Web Client,11,31
I am proud to cosponsor legislation to create a commemorative coin honoring Christa McAuliffe a Granite Stater who dared to touch the future as a teacher &amp; an astronaut.

With the shutdown over I'm heading back to D.C. with an open govt for my first time as a member of Congress. We have work to do to end shutdowns for good make federal employees &amp; contractors whole and get back to the important work ahead.,2019-01-28 20:57:52,Twitter Web Client,7,68

On #HolocaustRemembranceDay we pause to remember the millions of Jewish victims &amp; many others persecuted &amp; killed by the Nazis. 74 years ago today Auschwitz-Birkenau was liberated.

We owe these workers—and all the American people—a new way of doing business in Washington that puts political brinksmanship and shutdown politics behind us. 6/6,2019-01-25 20:33:15,Twitter Web Client,4,16
Today’s development is not a victory for any politician in Washington it’s a victory for the American people. I am grateful for our dedicated federal workers who only want to do their jobs serve their country and provide for their families. 5/6,2019-01-25 20:32:20,Twitter Web Client,4,10
But we should be clear that any future threat of a shutdown has no place in the dialogue of how to keep this country safe or pass comprehensive immigration reform. No President or leader in Congress should ever use federal workers and critical services as political leverage. 4/6,2019-01-25 20:32:19,Twitter Web Client,2,3
The President showed why shutting down the government is never a responsible strategy. Our democratic process is the way we must work out our differences. I'm eager to be a part of good faith discussions about investing in effective evidence-based border security proposals. 3/6,2019-01-25 20:32:18,Twitter Web Client,1,1
I’m looking forward to getting to work on matters critical to the people of New Hampshire with the government fully open for business. 2/6,2019-01-25 20:32:18,Twitter Web Client,2,6
This agreement is long-overdue &amp; an enormous relief to the 800000 federal employees who have gone 35 days without pay. The past 5 weeks have paralyzed critical govt functions &amp; cut services. The shutdown was a pointless exercise that didn’t change a thing.   Full statement: 1/6 https://t.co/iq42Z2RLU1,2019-01-25 20:32:17,Twitter Web Client,6,19
This shutdown has forced federal employees to go 35 days without a paycheck making it harder for families to pay their bills on time through no fault of their own. We're asking credit agencies to prevent late payments from hurting federal workers' credit score. #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/dkh7NbOk5g,2019-01-25 17:49:43,Twitter for iPhone,14,23
You’ve worked 5 weeks &amp; today you got a 2nd paystub showing $0 earned. Meanwhile politicians &amp; Admin billionaires don’t understand the urgency &amp; keep playing political games.  This is the treatment 800000 workers are receiving on #Day35. We owe it to them to #EndTheShutdown now. https://t.co/7D588Io3Xb,2019-01-25 15:44:28,Twitter Web Client,4,8
Today was the first meeting with my colleagues on @TransportDems. Repairing our crumbling roads &amp; bridges is essential for our public safety &amp; developing our economy. That’s why it’s imperative to #EndTheShutdown pay our federal workers &amp; get back to our nation’s work. https://t.co/3mLn1Zy3x0,2019-01-24 22:14:54,Twitter for iPhone,17,102
I stopped by @WCKitchen #ChefsForFeds to help @chefjoseandres &amp; his team serve lunch to federal workers impacted by this govt shutdown. It’s amazing to see this kind of generosity but heartbreaking how many hardworking Americans are suffering because of Washington dysfunction. https://t.co/1JM9ZptK7r,2019-01-24 19:34:32,Twitter for iPhone,9,29

It's #Day34. Tomorrow 800000 federal employees will miss their second paycheck. What is it going to take for the President and Senator McConnell to do the right thing? Let's stop the political brinksmanship put people before politics and #EndTheShutdown now. https://t.co/B6rqcaMyiH,2019-01-24 17:44:24,Twitter for iPhone,11,19
Today the Senate is slated to vote on a bipartisan bill to re-open govt at funding levels they supported in Dec. That bill already passed the House &amp; I'm hopeful Sen. Republicans will listen to constituents &amp; have the courage to send the bill to @POTUS’s desk &amp; #EndTheShutdown.,2019-01-24 15:25:29,Twitter for iPhone,19,48
New Hampshire families shouldn't have to suffer because of Washington dysfunction. That's why I voted to #EndTheShutdown for the 10th time today &amp; increase border security by $1.6 billion. It’s time for Senate Republicans to re-open our government &amp; allow us to get back to work. https://t.co/QlGWuEAveR,2019-01-23 23:24:10,Twitter for iPhone,379,974
Today I voted for the 10th time to re-open the government including $1.6 for border security. We should debate immigration reform but we can’t do it with the government closed. 800000 workers are not a political bargaining chip. #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/pbuT3wfe2Q,2019-01-23 23:13:26,Twitter Web Client,2,21
Today is #Day33 of the longest government shutdown in American history. On Friday more than 800000 Americans will miss their 2nd paycheck. The government should never be shut down for policy disagreements.

Today is #Day32 of the shutdown and we must continue to press the Senate leadership to take up the bipartisan govt funding bills. We can have a robust discussion about immigration &amp; 21st century border security once services are restored and 800000 workers get their paychecks. https://t.co/GDureg1slC,2019-01-22 18:52:01,Twitter Web Client,5,10

46 years ago the Supreme Court's landmark decision Roe v. Wade affirmed a woman’s right to choose.

This afternoon I joined members of the community at Temple Adath Yeshurun to remember the life &amp; struggle of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. He blazed a trail toward justice &amp; equality and his life should continue to inspire us to create a more perfect union. #MLKDay https://t.co/7QTHxcFpVz,2019-01-21 22:25:24,Twitter for iPhone,3,7
Today is #Day31 of the shutdown. On #MLKDay we ought to remember that it's never the most well-off &amp; well-connected who suffer the worst consequences of political dysfunction. The shutdown is hurting millions of families for no reason &amp; we must swiftly end it by reopening govt. https://t.co/F3TEOtmeCn,2019-01-21 19:40:56,Twitter for iPhone,18,32
It was inspiring to join @CityYearNH this morning at Hillside Middle School in Manchester to celebrate the life of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Every day City Year Americorps members are answering Dr. King's call to look out for others and serve the greater good. #MLKDay https://t.co/9Z2vr7TUmz,2019-01-21 16:01:35,Twitter for iPhone,8,31
