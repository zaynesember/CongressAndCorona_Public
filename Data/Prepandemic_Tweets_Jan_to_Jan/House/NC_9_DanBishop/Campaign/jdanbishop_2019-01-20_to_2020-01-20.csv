Well see there the tipster is anonymous. Here by virtue of collaboration with Shifty he’s a known source.  And inquiry into his biases and scheming will be far more interesting than the dueling characterizations of the facts. Let’s get started. https://t.co/DpuY99kH0n,2019-11-20 02:38:02,Twitter for iPhone,17,37
Democrat strategy is hard to fathom. The Senate will surely undertake the inquiry that Schiff is suppressing. And the plotting to manufacture this impeachment will rivet attention far more than the story of hurt bureaucrat feelings. Including abuse of the whistleblower process. https://t.co/UjqQgD9cgi,2019-11-18 15:38:29,Twitter for iPhone,20,66

I have an idea @McCreadyForNC. Let's meet and debate this in a neutral public forum THIS WEEK. Let the people of #NC09 hear in full how you'd keep them all locked into those sky-high Obamacare premiums co-pays and deductibles.  Enough B.S. and manipulation.  #ncpol https://t.co/Ew02XGlhaj,2019-08-18 23:50:03,Twitter Web App,36,52
Read your own article. For the non-subsidized ACA premiums are "increasingly out of reach." And big co-pays and deductibles too! By your logic THEY deny pre-existing conditions.  You would refuse people the relief AHPs provide. But 31 Ds "worked across the aisle."👍#nc09 #ncpol https://t.co/UUR2rmhK6U,2019-08-18 23:39:01,Twitter Web App,47,57

The way to apologize for lying is to say sorry not double down.   AHPs treat small employers like big employers — that simple. Pre-existing conditions covered as you suddenly admit. EHBs not mandated but typically provided. And cost savings! (That’s good!) #nc09 #ncpol https://t.co/CJXM6MZOul,2019-08-18 00:54:18,Twitter for iPhone,27,34

8 years into R majorities we are still improving the small business climate. The Small Business Healthcare Act adapts state law to take advantage of Trump reg changes. Allows small biz inclg self-employed to join association health plans. High-quality insurance cost savings. https://t.co/o3tirJGL5l,2019-02-19 18:34:26,Twitter for iPhone,7,18

@RaleighReporter is right. This Daily Mail hit piece on @NC_Governor is a disgusting lie. That’s what the Daily Mail does — lie.  What if neither side trafficked in lies and both sides called them out. https://t.co/FaXbo4J4wM,2019-02-09 20:31:00,Twitter for iPhone,12,31
