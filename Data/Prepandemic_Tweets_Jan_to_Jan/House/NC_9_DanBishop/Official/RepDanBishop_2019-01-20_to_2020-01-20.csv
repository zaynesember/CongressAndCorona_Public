There's no doubt that we need to reform the H-2A temporary agricultural worker program to fill empty farm jobs and support a robust Ag economy but don't fall for the claims that this is the solution. It isn't. It is a mass amnesty program for over 1000000 illegal aliens. 2/2,2019-12-11 22:00:47,Twitter Web App,3,8
I'm voting against the amnesty bill H.R.5038. This bill encourages people to cross illegally into the U.S. work illegally and then rewards them with citizenship.
