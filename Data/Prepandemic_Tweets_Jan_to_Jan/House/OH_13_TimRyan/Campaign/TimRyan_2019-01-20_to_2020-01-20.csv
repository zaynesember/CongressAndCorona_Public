My wife &amp; I grew up &amp; lived at the epicenter of deindustrialization in the US. Forty years ago her dad lost his job at Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube. A couple of weeks ago the GM plant just outside of Youngstown that used to have 16k workers just laid off its last shift. #IAcaucus https://t.co/9jzu7ladd4,2019-06-10 00:00:29,Twitter Web Client,28,120
