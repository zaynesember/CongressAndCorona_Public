@FinancialCmte @FSCDems It's abundantly clear that no comprehensive analysis was done to see how the most significant accounting change in decades would affect our economy. That's why I recently joined my colleagues on a bill to STOP &amp; STUDY the potential economic effects of CECL https://t.co/Th5Q3Ua4xV,2019-07-17 14:22:19,Twitter Web App,2,7
Bipartisan members of the @FinancialCmte @FSCDems are on the same page – it's irresponsible to blindly implement CECL before the economic effects are fully understood. This morning FASB will consider delaying some CECL implementation dates.   Put simply – that’s not good enough https://t.co/t0rGIdt0HF,2019-07-17 14:15:09,Twitter Web App,11,29
