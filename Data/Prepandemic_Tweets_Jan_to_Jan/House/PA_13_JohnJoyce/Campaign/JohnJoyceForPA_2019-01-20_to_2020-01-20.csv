Even @CNN admits the truth - Blair County is Trump Country. https://t.co/LKG6FuGKx0,2019-12-23 19:48:40,Twitter for iPhone,2,9

House Democrats' #ImpeachmentHoax has always been about attacking @realDonaldTrump and overruling Americans' votes in 2016.   The American people deserve better.,2019-12-09 17:43:23,Twitter for iPhone,0,2
From day one Democrats have been obsessed with attacking President @realDonaldTrump and avenging the 2016 election.   The people of PA-13 helped to elect @realDonaldTrump in 2016 and I will continue fighting to protect our duly and democratically-elected President.,2019-12-04 14:02:43,Twitter for iPhone,6,15

Thanks to everyone who attended today’s sold out conversation with Congressman @DevinNunes in Chambersburg.   Together we’re going to keep fighting for our conservative values. https://t.co/s9eBu8EQib,2019-11-16 20:05:57,Twitter for iPhone,1,4
.@TheDemocrats will tell you that impeachment is about the U.S. Constitution.   Their focus group-tested messaging says it's about the 2020 election. https://t.co/lToHIJnRhr,2019-11-15 17:47:11,Twitter for iPhone,5,10
There’s never been a better time for Congressman @DevinNunes to visit Franklin County. We’re planning a productive conversation about the sham impeachment inquiry and more. https://t.co/Dda1uMsAi8,2019-11-13 13:16:08,Twitter for iPhone,2,1

On #ElectionDay I encourage all PA-13 voters to support the GOP candidates on your ballot who will fight to protect our conservative values and champion our commonsense priorities.

Senator Warren's socialist health care plan would cost $52 TRILLION - a tremendous burden for American taxpayers. This is yet another part of Democrats' extreme agenda that Pennsylvanians don't want and can't afford. https://t.co/DwQf8X0iBD,2019-11-01 15:39:35,Twitter for iPhone,0,1
Under @realDonaldTrump's leadership the United States is defeating ISIS and making the world a safer place. This is a great day for freedom and justice. https://t.co/up7LITfG1E,2019-10-28 20:42:58,Twitter for iPhone,0,1
Since President Trump took office Pennsylvania has experienced record-breaking economic growth - a huge benefit for our region. Today it will be great to have @realDonaldTrump back in the Keystone State.,2019-10-23 16:31:22,Twitter for iPhone,1,3

While Democrats obsess over their politically-motivated impeachment inquiry I'm working hard to:   - Deliver a better deal for PA farmers   - Secure the southern border and #BuildTheWall   - Strengthen the economy   - Work with @realDonaldTrump to deliver on our promises,2019-10-02 14:39:10,Twitter for iPhone,0,1
Last night it was great to join so many dedicated conservatives at the Bedford County GOP 2019 Fall Dinner. They're working hard to re-elect @realDonaldTrump and restore a Republican Majority in the House in 2020. https://t.co/9KiZC9PVFQ,2019-10-01 17:15:21,Twitter for iPhone,1,2
Democrats have been obsessed with impeaching President Trump from day one. We won't back down from this fight. Help me defend President Trump and continue fighting for your conservative values. https://t.co/lwXt7mucqL,2019-09-25 23:15:08,Twitter for iPhone,0,2
“Joining Pence on the stop Rep. John Joyce (R-PA-13) urged fellow members of Congress to pass the agreement. ‘We have a responsibility to pass the USMCA’ he said. ‘We have the responsibility to realize that this is going to allow jobs to continue’”  https://t.co/VqHssnz26i,2019-08-03 14:40:36,Twitter for iPhone,0,3
The Adams County Republican Club had a strong presence at the South Mountain Fair in Biglerville. Martha O’Bryant and Cynde and Bud Vance greeted us with enthusiasm and made it clear that President Trump will once again be victorious in 2020. https://t.co/hiZpgJh4o7,2019-08-02 01:01:59,Twitter for iPhone,0,5
We have hardworking Americans who cannot afford their care. What about them? President Trump and I are going to work together to lower health care costs for all Americans and I strongly oppose having taxpayers foot the bill for the care of those who break our immigration laws.,2019-06-28 18:34:19,TweetDeck,0,0
All of the Democrats on the stage at last night's debate raised their hands when asked if they would provide taxpayer funded health care to illegal immigrants. This is unacceptable. https://t.co/elj93UfcQ3,2019-06-28 18:33:34,TweetDeck,0,1
This is exactly why we need to reelect President Trump who I will work with to develop a market based health care plan that drives down costs for all Americans.  Expect more radical proposals from the Democrats participating in round two tonight.,2019-06-28 00:16:10,TweetDeck,0,1
Last night Elizabeth Warren raised her hand when asked if she wanted to eliminate private health insurance to implement a government takeover of health care. As a physician I know how much of a disaster this socialist policy will be. https://t.co/QEdTWOrQjg,2019-06-28 00:15:33,TweetDeck,1,4
Enjoyed watching @realDonaldTrump begin his reelection campaign this week. It has been an incredible first six months in Congress supporting his conservative agenda and I look forward to continuing to work with him and helping him win Pennsylvania in 2020. https://t.co/Yf5DxLBq5u,2019-06-21 11:43:22,TweetDeck,3,5

We've seen tremendous success under President Trump due to conservative initiatives such as the tax cuts and his great Supreme Court appointments. South Central Pennsylvania is behind the President and so am I. https://t.co/TvkrkmWJ7F,2019-05-16 17:09:25,TweetDeck,1,2
