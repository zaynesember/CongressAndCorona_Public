As we have heard - directly - from House Democrats their impeachment inquiry is not about facts. This is about sabotaging our duly and democratically-elected President and preventing his re-election in 2020.

As I said before Mueller's testimony the report already told us everything we need to know. There was no collusion. There was no obstruction. Yesterday confirmed that.

As a representative from rural Pennsylvania I’m quite familiar with ‘Groundhog Day’ and that’s exactly what Mr. Mueller’s testimony today reminded me of. He offered nothing new.

@HSBCgop My goal is to fight for policies that will have a positive impact on small business owners. That's why I support making the 2017 tax cuts permanent and will stand against any Democrat effort to get rid of them.
