Thank you Mr. President for such a quick response to this disaster in our state.  I know your support is appreciated by those impacted by these deadly storms. https://t.co/kSV0YzmBlu,2019-03-08 15:55:35,Twitter for iPhone,7,31
I am deeply saddened about the storms in our state Sunday and the lives those storms took.   I ask you to please join me in praying for the families of those who were killed those who were hurt and those who had their homes and lives destroyed.,2019-03-04 22:13:04,Twitter for iPhone,3,47
There is not a corner of our state that has not benefited from Senator Shelby’s service in the United States Senate.   I wish him many more days of service to our state and to our nation ahead!,2019-03-03 19:08:56,Twitter for iPhone,3,16
I want to congratulate @SenShelby on becoming Alabama’s longest serving senator.  Almost 12 thousand days in the United States Senate is remarkable in and of itself but the impact Senator Shelby has had on Alabama during this time makes it even more so.,2019-03-03 19:08:32,Twitter for iPhone,6,35

The Democrats’ new ‘Green Deal’ will provide a living wage to those “unwilling to work.”  This is not what we should want our children to aspire to grow up and become “unwilling to work.”  But this plan encourages just that.,2019-02-07 22:58:33,Twitter for iPhone,16,59
This pretty much speaks for itself.  The @realDonaldTrump speech was not just well received by most in the chamber but across the country. The same poll showed 72% agree with his immigration plan so I say to my colleagues let’s get to it! https://t.co/01bhGXBdYm,2019-02-06 12:23:38,Twitter for iPhone,12,68
I'm glad to see that the @USDA is reining in abuse of SNAP benefit waivers that allowed able bodied individuals with no children to receive benefits without having to work. If you are able to work &amp; have no dependents you should be working as a requirement for those benefits.,2019-02-01 20:53:43,Twitter Web Client,2,23
Today I joined President Trump in the Oval Office as he signed an executive order that will strengthen "Buy American" provisions that I have championed.  Government funded infrastructure projects being built with American tax dollars should be built with American made products. https://t.co/AMiiCi9fBg,2019-01-31 19:57:32,Twitter Web Client,24,75

In the rush to claim victory to deny initial funding for Border Security I wonder if the Democrats will remember their pledge to negotiate w/the White House to address what is a very real problem?

For far too long foreign countries have levied significantly higher tariffs on the U.S. ⁦@realDonaldTrump⁩ understands these types of acts are unjust. The U.S. Reciprocal Trade Act would provide the President leverage to lower their unfair tariffs. https://t.co/qqQZrDG7IA,2019-01-24 20:36:25,Twitter for iPhone,3,6
This morning 214 Democrats denied furloughed DHS employees immediate pay. Democrats continue to use the suffering of our public servants as a political tool to keep them away from the negotiating table. For the third time now Democrats prove they aren’t looking for solutions. https://t.co/hHrQiOBBfx,2019-01-24 15:57:24,Twitter for iPhone,263,507
