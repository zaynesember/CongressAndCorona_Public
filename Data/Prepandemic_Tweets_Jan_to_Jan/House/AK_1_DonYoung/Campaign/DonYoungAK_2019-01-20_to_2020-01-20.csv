My prayers are with the families and crew of the Scandies Rose which sank near Kodiak Tuesday night.  I applaud the hard work of the Coast Guard rescuers who battled harsh conditions and risked their lives to locate and save two of the missing crew members. https://t.co/YXUb5QKJpG,2020-01-02 21:40:23,Twitter Web App,2,2

I enjoyed catching up with Ken Maynard at the Lucky Wishbone. Ken is an old friend and his wife Myrna was a longtime campaign volunteer. We sadly lost her this year but it was great sharing memories of her with Ken at one of my favorite places in Anchorage. https://t.co/5wardZcW2e,2019-12-24 19:59:52,Twitter Web App,1,3

Had a wonderful time last night at The Whale Fat Follies! Thanks to Mr. Whitekeys and his band and cast for bringing us more than 30 years of laughs and for being such a beloved part of AK history.

My motivation to serve is the same as it was when I first ran for Congress four decades ago: I will fight for you our children and grandchildren.
