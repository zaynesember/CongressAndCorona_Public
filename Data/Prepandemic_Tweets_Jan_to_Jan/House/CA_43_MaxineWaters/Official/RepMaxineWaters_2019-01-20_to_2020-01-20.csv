The demonstrations around the country today must not be ignored. Americans do not support the Impeached President’s needless escalation w/ Iran nor do we want a senseless war. Peace advocates must not let up! Let’s keep showing our power &amp; sending Trump a message: #NoWarWithIran,2020-01-10 00:31:01,Twitter for iPhone,1172,3841
Many are outraged that the impeached prez nearly caused a war w/ Iran &amp; want Congress to intervene.

WAPO documented 15000+ lies told by Trump since he took office. How can the American people trust him when he lies all the time?
