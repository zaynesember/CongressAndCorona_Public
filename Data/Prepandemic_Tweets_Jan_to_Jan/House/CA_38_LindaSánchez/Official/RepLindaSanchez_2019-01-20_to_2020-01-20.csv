Should you have to pass a background check in order to get a gun?  Over 90% of Americans think so.  The House passed a bipartisan background check bill in February.

El Paso is not only a painful reminder of the devastation that accompanies white supremacy it’s also another reason why we badly need to pass commonsense gun control measures.
