I'm voting YES on this Motion to Recommit to add language to #HR1 recognizing that allowing illegal immigrants the right to vote devalues and diminishes the voting power of American citizens.   Let's see how @SpeakerPelosi's caucus feels about that. https://t.co/uwTYwLlKSA,2019-03-08 16:01:02,Twitter Web Client,23,47
.@SpeakerPelosi’s H.R. 1 (AKA the Democratic Party Protection Act) uses YOUR hard-earned taxpayer $ to line the campaign coffers of people you may not even support.   Millions of your dollars spent -- all to keep politicians in office.   I'm voting NO on this top-down power grab. https://t.co/fCcqK5Rk2r,2019-03-08 15:57:47,Twitter Web Client,5,10

The Democratic Party Protection Act is nothing but a power grab directly violating Americans’ right to free speech.

.@nytimes: "Gunmen at the center of a number of high-profile mass shootings passed background checks and legally purchased the firearms they used.”   #HR1112 brought up by Democrats today wouldn't have prevented tragedies like Parkland. https://t.co/3sUCBDFA78,2019-02-28 15:42:19,Twitter Web Client,5,9
We saw what happens when agencies don't work together from the tragedies in Parkland and Aurora Illinois. In some cases the FBI has admitted it missed red flags and opportunities to intervene and stop shooters.

I voted YES for this Motion which would require ICE is notified when an illegal immigrant tries to buy a gun through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.  Someone in our country illegally is telling our government they're here.   ICE should know about it. https://t.co/IHVZaHiQML,2019-02-27 20:42:21,Twitter Web Client,7,26
Most criminals show signs they're violent or disturbed. The problem is most law enforcement agencies ignore them.  We saw it in Parkland. We saw it again in Aurora Illinois.   I'm sponsoring a bill to help fix these problems and address them head on. Look for info later today.,2019-02-27 19:47:01,Twitter Web Client,0,1

$93 trillion = $65000 per household  FOUR TIMES our national debt (which is already too high)  If each household earning more than $100000 were taxed at a 100% rate for 10 years Dems would still fall more than $32 trillion short.

It will be important that Congress continues to monitor and review the president’s role in this process to ensure the actions taken are within constitutional and statutory authority.,2019-02-15 21:02:40,Twitter Web Client,0,5
Emergency declarations do not allow the President to circumvent the Constitution. President Trump’s exercise of national emergency powers is limited. He is not creating a new law or allocating additional funding. He is re-appropriating money already set aside for other projects.,2019-02-15 21:02:24,Twitter Web Client,1,9
It’s Congress’ duty to ensure the President is acting within his constitutional authority to address that crisis. After research and consideration I believe Trump is acting within his authority to take this action.,2019-02-15 21:01:59,Twitter Web Client,0,3

I voted "no" on the FY2019 spending package tonight.

On #HolocaustMemorialDay we pledge to never forget the victims of Nazism — including the nearly six million Jews — killed during the Holocaust. #WeRemember⁠ them &amp; the heroes who saved the lives of many. May we strive to live up to their example. https://t.co/RddbsQmlqZ,2019-01-27 16:10:19,Twitter for iPhone,25,48
Democrats have said they are willing to discuss our border security including physical barriers – that’s a promising sign. I hope they make good on their word. We need to solve this problem because it’s our job. The American people are counting on us.,2019-01-25 22:04:31,Twitter Web Client,0,3
Over the next few weeks we have a great opportunity to address border security. Walls work. They’re a critical part of the solution for our immigration problem. We need a wall to keep our borders safe and lessen the drugs flowing into our country over our Southern border.,2019-01-25 22:04:18,Twitter Web Client,2,6
I am glad the federal government is going to reopen and our 800000 furloughed workers will be paid. As I’ve said before shutting down our government isn’t an effective way to legislate.,2019-01-25 22:04:11,Twitter Web Client,0,7

Democrats' biggest talking point during this shutdown has been the 800000 federal employees working without pay. Well we've voted three times in a week to pay our federal workers.   Guess who voted against that? Hint: They're all Democrats. https://t.co/nL2xm9WD6g,2019-01-24 20:23:58,Twitter Web Client,955,1131
Make that not just once not just twice but now THREE times Democrats have voted against paying our furloughed workers. https://t.co/zOtMd87joK,2019-01-24 16:08:04,Twitter Web Client,135,258
Love this story of students celebrating #NationalSchoolChoiceWeek week in York County. Students and parents deserve to choose the best education setting to help children learn grow and succeed.   https://t.co/JXzMAc3RkN,2019-01-24 15:19:11,Twitter Web Client,1,7
I voted FOR this today because it pays furloughed federal workers currently affected by the shutdown.   215 Democrats disagreed. They voted against paying our federal workers — not just once but twice. They’re refusing to pay workers putting them out of a 2nd paycheck on Friday. https://t.co/PQpdZ8NNeA,2019-01-23 21:49:22,Twitter for iPhone,20,20
Thanks to @LancasterOnline for this. I also hope other members — on both sides of the aisle — will support my bill to prevent government shutdowns. https://t.co/FkS2acMbfp https://t.co/omJFi9lIJN,2019-01-23 16:20:01,Twitter for iPhone,2,4
