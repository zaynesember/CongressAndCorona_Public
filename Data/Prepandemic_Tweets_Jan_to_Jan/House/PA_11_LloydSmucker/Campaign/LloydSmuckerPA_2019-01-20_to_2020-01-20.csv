.@LancasterOnline Ed Board has an issue with grassroots activism now?  Where was this when Jess King payed herself to campaign full time or the shadowy Super PAC Lancaster Stands Up operating in our community peddling socialism. Liberty and independence deserve a voice too.,2019-02-06 16:43:27,Twitter for iPhone,0,5
Would have been responsible for Ed Board to ask for a bit of clarity before writing this. This campaign is about building a grassroots movement based on liberty and independence. Those values don’t disappear just because it’s an ‘off year.’ https://t.co/UIlHqsVEJt,2019-02-06 16:42:50,Twitter for iPhone,1,3
