Today @DevinNunes read the transcript of the call between @POTUS &amp; President Zelensky. Word for word. So Americans could hear the truth.  REMEMBER: Adam Schiff made a parody of a call between @POTUS &amp; President Zelensky making it up &amp; omitting the facts.  The contrast is clear.,2019-11-15 15:40:57,Twitter Web App,596,1689

Elections happen at the ballot box and cannot be overturned because disgruntled Democrats do not like @POTUS. That's what this impeachment sham boils down to. Plain and simple.

A scary thought: Abolishing @ICEgov &amp; prioritizing the needs of illegal aliens.
