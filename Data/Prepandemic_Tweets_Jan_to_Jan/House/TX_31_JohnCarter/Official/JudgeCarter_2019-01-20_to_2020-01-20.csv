Their behavior over the last three years is the very behavior the Founding Fathers warned us about. Fortunately I have no doubt that the American people recognize Democrats’ antics and they will not easily forget. Today is truly a sad day for justice.,2019-12-19 01:56:35,Twitter Web App,3,10
Impeachment is one of the most serious acts that Congress will undertake it should not be taken lightly or used to strong arm those you disagree with politically. It’s irresponsible that the Democrats have weaponized the impeachment process to appease their voting base.,2019-12-19 01:56:34,Twitter Web App,7,16
The Constitution is clear — treason bribery or high crimes and misdemeanors are impeachable offenses. The evidence presented does not meet those standards required by the supreme law of the land.,2019-12-19 01:56:34,Twitter Web App,0,4

While the Democrats try to rewrite their history the truth is that the impeachment of President Trump began the day he was inaugurated.

The evidence presented by the House Majority in this case was hearsay. In fact the most substantial direct evidence was the transcript of the President’s telephone call which did not prove an impeachable offense.,2019-12-19 01:56:33,Twitter Web App,0,2
This entire impeachment process has lacked impartiality respect for the Constitution and justice. When I was on the bench I instructed every jury the same way.

House Democrats blocked legislation that would've prevented federal employees who have been disciplined for sexual misconduct from receiving a pay raise. Commonsense legislation that both sides SHOULD get behind but Democrats blocked it...,2019-01-30 21:48:08,Twitter Web Client,4,4

Challenge Coins are a way to show service members and veterans appreciation for their sacrifice and service to our nation. This year TX-31 has a new challenge coin designed by Rowan Dennis from Liberty Hill High School.,2019-01-28 19:00:01,TweetDeck,1,2
She did a wonderful job designing a coin which reflects our commitment to our troops across America and our connection to Ft. Hood.,2019-01-28 19:00:01,TweetDeck,1,2
I recently had the opportunity to present Rowan with a framed copy of our new Challenge Coin.  I’m looking forward to sharing Rowan’s fantastic design with constituents across the district. https://t.co/gPKYPpJoih,2019-01-28 19:00:00,TweetDeck,1,2

Thank you to the Wind Therapy Freedom Riders that have gathered to ride to #AirForce #Veteran Joseph Walker’s funeral this morning.

I’m glad to see this shutdown end and federal employees be paid. It’s now time to negotiate and address the very serious situation on the southern border.,2019-01-26 03:33:01,Twitter for iPhone,4,18

Speaker Pelosi flat out refused to consider the President’s proposal despite the fact that it would provide protections for DACA recipients something Democrats have continually wanted in the past. They are more focused on obstructing than negotiating.,2019-01-23 23:00:01,TweetDeck,2,7
ALL Republicans voted FOR it. For the Democrats it isn't about paying federal employees or reopening the government. Their unwillingness to negotiate shows that their only goal is to obstruct.,2019-01-23 22:57:37,Twitter Web Client,3,3
This vote would've paid all federal employees during the shutdown until a solution is reached...215 Democrats just voted AGAINST it. https://t.co/fWjvGibReX,2019-01-23 22:53:47,Twitter Web Client,3,3
By rejecting President Trump’s latest compromise without even making a counter offer Nancy Pelosi has shown she’s not interested in negotiating to reopen the government. It is beyond time for Speaker Pelosi and the Democrats to come to the table to negotiate.,2019-01-23 17:25:03,Twitter Web Client,1,9
