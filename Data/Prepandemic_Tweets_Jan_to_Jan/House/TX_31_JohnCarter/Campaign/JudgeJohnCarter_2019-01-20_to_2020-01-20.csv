Guess what the Democrats are doing with your taxpayer dollars? H.R.1 is  designed to fund the Democratic majority. Under H.R.1 there is a 6:1 gov match of contributions to a presidential candidate- up to $250 million taxpayer dollars could go toward a presidential campaign! https://t.co/kYtc9JHg2i,2019-02-13 18:01:01,Sprout Social,0,5

Want to know the Democrats’ priorities for America? Under H.R. 1 Democrats want the federal government to match small political contributions under $200 at a 6:1 ratio.
