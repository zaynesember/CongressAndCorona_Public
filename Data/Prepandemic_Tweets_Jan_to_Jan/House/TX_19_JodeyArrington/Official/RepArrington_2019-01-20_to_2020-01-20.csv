Mexico just ratified #USMCA now Congress should too. #USMCA will increase market access for farmers ranchers &amp; energy producers.

By expanding market access for our farmers &amp; ranchers #USMCA would increase U.S. ag &amp; food exports by $2.2 billion. @POTUS has done his job by renegotiating NAFTA so it works better for U.S. ag producers now it’s time for Congress to do ours by passing the USMCA without delay!,2019-06-17 22:08:58,Twitter Web Client,4,9
