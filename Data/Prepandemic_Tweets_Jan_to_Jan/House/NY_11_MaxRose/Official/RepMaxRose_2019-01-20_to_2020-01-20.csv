There is no rhyme or reason to this policy and it only does more harm to our national security.   Fighting to keep families together no matter what country they're from is distinctly American. https://t.co/siGv9Zv496,2020-01-17 23:34:14,Twitter for iPhone,2,16
Was proud to deliver the news first-hand at the Islamic Center of Staten Island that more than 30 members joined me to urge Congress to repeal the Muslim ban.  Calling it a "Travel Ban" doesn't change the fact that its a xenophobic policy with no basis in our national security. https://t.co/LQLZxnrSeY,2020-01-17 23:34:13,Twitter for iPhone,7,75

While others rushed to support the original USMCA that protected drug companies and screwed over American workers I refused to accept that we couldn't reach a strong bipartisan compromise that will help workers patients consumers and our economy.

The @MLB plan to scrap the @SIYanks which for 20 years have given us a window into the future of the Bronx Bombers and given back to our community would be a devastating loss for Staten Island.

Corporate PACs flood DC with campaign donations including over $400 million in 2018 alone! But it’s not the American people’s priorities they have in mind—it’s their own bottom lines. That’s wrong and at the root of Washington corruption.,2019-11-15 17:35:36,Twitter Web App,2,7

I appreciate the leadership of @RepBrownley and @VetAffairsDems in passing the Deborah Sampson Act of which my bill was a part and treating the issue of care for women veterans with the seriousness and importance it deserves.,2019-11-13 17:03:30,Twitter for iPhone,2,12

With the number of women veterans skyrocketing it’s ridiculous and downright unacceptable that our VA facilities don’t have the capability to properly give women the treatment they require.

Honored to join the ceremony today to officially send the Never Forget the Heroes Act to #Renew911VCF to the President's desk and to keep this pen in my office as a tribute to those who fought so hard to get us here and to the sacrifices of all of our 9/11 heroes. https://t.co/Oah8Ollpvw,2019-07-24 17:59:36,TweetDeck,10,48
Time and time again these companies and the GIFCT have failed.  That's why I laid out some important first steps that would actually make a difference to stop the spread of terrorism online.  They have to do more. They have to be better. Lives are on the line.,2019-07-23 22:27:49,TweetDeck,3,8
The leading social media companies are gathering tomorrow for their biannual meeting of the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism (GIFCT).  Sounds great that they're coming together to address terrorism on their platforms right? WRONG. https://t.co/JJfcUL6PAJ,2019-07-23 22:27:49,TweetDeck,3,4
Every week we’re losing another hero due to their service following the 9/11 attacks. Our work to #Renew911VCF will by no means bring these men and women back or heal those who are battling sickness. But in doing so we will ensure these heroes will never be forgotten.,2019-07-23 19:47:24,TweetDeck,3,27
BREAKING: The bill to #Renew911VCF has finally passed the Senate and is headed to the President's desk.

Staten Islanders shouldn’t lose out on a chance to testify against the @PANYNJ’s toll hikes because of apocalyptic weather. I’ll still be there tonight but I’m sure so many others won’t be able to make it.   @PANYNJ needs to schedule another hearing.,2019-07-22 23:02:42,Twitter for iPhone,4,9

I urge my colleagues in the Senate to act with the same urgency.,2019-06-12 14:34:32,Twitter for iPhone,53,194
Honored to join @SerraRob and all the heroic NYers at today’s @HouseJudiciary hearing to #Renew911VCF.

I’m proud to see the House taking real action to #Renew911VCF and hope to see the Senate follow suit with similar speed and urgency. Failure to do so is simply not an option.,2019-06-11 14:25:20,TweetDeck,11,41
The heroes of 9/11 will never stop feeling the effects of that day so I will never stop fighting for them and neither should Congress.  We must permanently #Renew911VCF so that these heroes can have the peace of mind that we'll never stop supporting them. https://t.co/Wuati6VKxE,2019-06-11 14:25:20,TweetDeck,48,155

If a disease was the second leading cause of death in children you bet Congress would do everything in its power stop it.

Mitch McConnell is failing to do his job. The American people have been loud and clear: end Washington corruption and drain the swamp. We passed #HR1 because that’s what we said we’d do.

Facebook isn't only failing at stopping the spread of terrorist content but even worse it's AI is creating pages and promoting terrorist content.

This act of anti-Semitic vandalism at Chabad of Staten Island synagogue is gut wrenching.   But we cannot ignore it.

"Hopefully we can manage through the cuts."  That's what the head of @DHSgov said when I pressed him on their proposed $587 million cuts to counterterrorism programs NYC relies on.

The decision to end the DED program is purely political not based in any reality. Now our neighbors live in fear of what comes next of lives being uprooted and families separated. I'm fighting this.

Only in Washington would we see a group of people actively trying to sabotage anti-corruption measures. The political stunt meant to distract divide and sow hatred is yet again just another political game. Another example of why the American people hate politics. #HR1 https://t.co/7fyaGFmOkH,2019-03-08 18:15:37,Twitter Media Studio,203,548
BREAKING: we just passed #HR1 the most sweeping and comprehensive anti-corruption pro-democracy legislation in the history of Congress. Whether it's to drain the swamp or end corruption in DC we just did something unheard of in Washington--we kept our promise. https://t.co/3SJFwlZWbm,2019-03-08 18:11:41,Twitter Web Client,117,750

For those who have magically found their strength to tackle bigotry in our country I would remind them it doesn’t take courage to condemn hate in another party but it takes character to stand up to your own.   That's why I voted in support of today's resolution. https://t.co/sYVKdo9nCw,2019-03-07 22:53:35,Twitter Web Client,15,79
Passing #HR1 is just the opening salvo—but we're not stopping here. This is just the first step in our efforts to change politics in this country. Because the American people are united and want the same thing. Our question to Republicans in the Senate is: whose side are you on? https://t.co/5CrINX3qSK,2019-03-07 20:16:28,Twitter Media Studio,36,131

We need to stop the flow of drugs coming across our border. But in my questioning of @SecNielsen I did not hear her say that building the border wall will prevent the children in my district and throughout this country of dying from opioid overdoses.

Hard working Americans see this for what it is: corruption.  Democrats Republicans Independents--everyone is sick and tired of DC lobbyists playing the system to rip them off.  Let's pass #HR1 and close the #LobbyistLoophole https://t.co/CzVLl4onNk,2019-03-05 20:24:23,Twitter Web Client,14,38
I called on Congress to pass my bill to close the #LobbyistLoophole--because both Democrats and Republicans have exploited this for far too long.  Proud that this legislation is included in #HR1 because it’s time that we do our jobs and end this culture of corruption. https://t.co/zjbZRiw3gV,2019-03-05 20:23:50,Twitter Media Studio,24,97

But until this is fully built our work isn’t done and I’m going to continue to be in close contact with the Army Corps and the local community to ensure the Seawall is built properly and on time.,2019-02-27 00:18:54,Twitter Web Client,2,15
Coupled with last week's funding agreement this one-two punch will allow the Seawall to finally get built and have the long-term stability the project requires. The Army Corps has told me that they expect construction to begin early next year.,2019-02-27 00:18:27,Twitter Web Client,3,16

I'm proud to be helping lead the bipartisan fight to fully and permanently fund the VCF because when it comes to doing what’s right it’s about keeping our promises and honoring those who put their lives on the line and didn’t ask anything in return. #Renew911VCF,2019-02-26 18:02:31,Twitter Web Client,2,14
Now is the chance to put action behind the words #NeverForget. Because with the #VCF running out of money and cutting benefits thousands of 9/11 heroes and their families now face being forgotten.  That’s wrong and if we fail to make that right shame on us. #Renew911VCF https://t.co/YW0mXxed6G,2019-02-26 18:02:14,Twitter Web Client,6,26
Thank you to @RepMaloney @RepPeteKing and @RepJerryNadler for your leadership. I'm honored to join them with @RepLeeZeldin to lead a bipartisan effort to build the necessary support to #Renew911VCF,2019-02-25 22:39:13,Twitter Web Client,3,26
"Never Forget" can't just be a slogan. It's time to actually show our 9/11 first responders and their families that we'll always have their backs.  Allowing cuts to the Victims Compensation Fund is simply not an option. #Renew911VCF https://t.co/rcwdjYWXeJ,2019-02-25 22:39:12,Twitter Web Client,13,62

It’s easy to focus on how divided our national politics has become but when you spend time in our communities you see great organizations like Central Family Life Center bringing people together fighting injustice and rejecting the premise that progress is “too hard.” #BHM https://t.co/J2w2uSSt8l,2019-02-23 20:20:52,Twitter for iPhone,4,22
Appreciate the @USACE_NY giving me a tour of East Shore Seawall site today so we can continue working together to make sure this is built right and on time. We’re on the 1-yard line in Congress to make sure this project has the long-term stability it needs. Let's get this done! https://t.co/RPCYJFhzFe,2019-02-22 21:58:46,Twitter Web Client,2,6
Words can't begin to explain the honor of serving alongside heroes like @RepJohnLewis.  On this 63rd anniversary of the #MontgomeryBusBoycott let's all remember his call to get in #GoodTrouble in the face of injustice. #BHM https://t.co/ba0JuSp8dT,2019-02-22 18:46:15,Twitter for iPhone,8,33
It would be a broken promise of epic proportions if we allow the 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund to run out to cut benefits. Proud to help lead the fight to make sure that never happens.,2019-02-21 21:44:42,Twitter for iPhone,7,32
The first responders who ran towards danger on 9/11 are now at incredibly high risk for diseases that can take years or even decades to manifest.  They deserve the comfort of knowing that should they get sick years down the road we'll have their backs just like they had ours. https://t.co/QUKhxXHUco,2019-02-21 21:43:35,Twitter for iPhone,14,70

I know first hand the destructive power of military-style assault weapons which is why I strongly believe that they have no place on our streets.

Banning assault weapons isn't radical it's common sense. After the 1994 assault weapons ban gun massacres fell by 37 percent.  It should come as no surprise that the majority of Americans support this ban now a majority of Congress must do the same. https://t.co/fcVBCCbMl6,2019-02-15 22:27:58,Twitter for iPhone,16,62
Yesterday I met w/ a Staten Island firefighter whose 1st day on the job was 9/11.

The people of #NY11 are tired of being screwed over and ignored. The city is already crushing our middle class families with insane property taxes &amp; now the SALT Cap is raising taxes even more.

That's why I'm looking forward to hearing directly from them at my Veterans Breakfast Listening Session https://t.co/lML5PpzW7J,2019-02-11 20:25:37,Twitter for iPhone,3,20
.@StatenIslandDA Michael McMahon knows we need to be fighting the drug epidemic with everything we've got. Everyone should take note of his innovative approaches to help those in need and lock up those peddling death. https://t.co/jS9tGtx5wM,2019-02-11 18:24:45,Twitter for iPhone,2,4
Honored to celebrate the #LunarNewYear with @cpc_nyc. Going to be a great #YearOfThePig! https://t.co/nQPjSxbcMS,2019-02-09 19:13:29,Twitter for iPhone,2,11

Great way to start the day in South Brooklyn with breakfast at the Bridgeview Diner with leaders in the Greek community. https://t.co/M1rSselcPD,2019-02-09 18:44:42,Twitter for iPhone,6,28
Thank you @RepBrownley and @VetAffairsDems for your leadership on this. There's no question #ChildCare4Vets will save lives so I urge my colleagues in the Senate to pass this bill as soon as possible.,2019-02-08 17:20:37,Twitter for iPhone,8,18
BREAKING: Proud to say the House just passed the Veterans' Access to Child Care Act including my amendment ensuring that vets seeking substance abuse counseling never have to choose between getting treatment and taking care of their child. #ChildCare4Vets https://t.co/u1IhG48X70,2019-02-08 17:20:36,Twitter for iPhone,14,58
Let's get this done because #ChildCare4Vets will save lives. https://t.co/awuA9HhG49,2019-02-08 16:05:20,Twitter for iPhone,7,28
What’s happened at #MDC is unacceptable. I will continue working with @NydiaVelazquez and @RepJerryNadler to make sure this investigation is thorough and most importantly this never happens again. https://t.co/mAWvFlvdiV,2019-02-08 15:28:40,Twitter for iPhone,7,38
The opioid epidemic has disproportionately affected our vets so we need to make it easier not harder to receive treatment. I'm proud to have worked with @VetAffairsDems to pass my amendment providing veterans seeking substance abuse treatment access to childcare services. https://t.co/mtX5wrU672,2019-02-07 21:48:58,Twitter Web Client,14,68
About to speak on the House floor about by amendment to ensure vets seeking substance abuse treatment have access to childcare so they don't have to choose between treatment or their kids. WATCH NOW:  https://t.co/8DJdMjBeZd,2019-02-07 20:39:44,Twitter for iPhone,8,25
Our prescription drug system has put profits first not patients.  I strongly support Medicare negotiating drug prices. This is something that everyone should support. Let's get it done. Proud to be a cosponsor of the strongest bill to date to #EndRxMonopolyPrices https://t.co/mp3Z2evtCS,2019-02-07 18:11:13,Twitter for iPhone,17,45
This all could have been avoided if the city had included our community in the process before this decision was made.  They didn't and now CB 1 has no choice but force the city to listen. I'm proud to stand with them in making sure their voices are heard. https://t.co/HtRGfTIDlJ,2019-02-06 20:37:55,Twitter for iPhone,2,3
Thank you Michele for joining me for the State of the Union last night! What a powerful advocate for all those battling the disease of addiction. Can't wait to see you again this summer at your Walk For Hope! https://t.co/3Z2vWGyHMp,2019-02-06 17:53:20,Twitter for iPhone,4,17
Tonight’s the easy part but tomorrow we have to get to work. The President is right Americans are united around doing something to lower healthcare costs rebuild our infrastructure and end the opioid epidemic. Lets do our jobs and get the results Americans expect of us. #SOTU,2019-02-06 04:47:17,Twitter for iPhone,13,48
Addiction is a disease that inflicts all races genders and classes. We need to be doing all that we can to make sure the opioid epidemic stays on the front burner not the back burner so we can tackle this once and for all. https://t.co/X0Ad8p1Qhy,2019-02-06 00:53:28,Twitter Web Client,6,46
I’m honored to have Michele Kunz as my guest to the #SOTU. Michele lost her son Bobby in 2015 following a tragic accident during his struggle with addiction to opioids. She was kind enough to share a touching and powerful tribute “A Message of Hope”  https://t.co/tgKtJy6Uqz,2019-02-05 21:33:21,Twitter for iPhone,5,28
Great convo with @MelissaRusso4NY about tonight's #SOTU. https://t.co/zJvaiXk2ws,2019-02-05 19:57:05,Twitter for iPhone,1,2

What happened to Ethan and his family was wrong. I’m happy to see some results finally but I will not stop holding insurance companies accountable when they screw over families in my district.  https://t.co/kKxLyizIhj,2019-02-04 22:01:53,Twitter for iPhone,6,8
The @MTA said they’re buying new buses for the L Train shutdown. If that’s not happening @HeyNowJO and are I just asking where are those buses? Send them over to Staten Island!  https://t.co/ZlbORAiUTd,2019-02-03 16:33:56,Twitter for iPhone,7,20
On Jackie Robinson's 100th birthday his lessons in courage and living a life in service of others are as relevant as ever.  "A life is not important except in the impact it has on other lives." #JR100,2019-01-31 23:59:12,Twitter for iPhone,4,23
Honored for the chance to help defend our nation and secure our homeland from terrorist threats. Nearly 18 years after 9/11 it's about time a member from NYC held this position.

Proud to be working with @RepGolden and @RepDanCrenshaw to bring some common sense to Washington.,2019-01-30 20:20:37,Twitter Web Client,1,12
Keeping the government up and running is the most basic thing that our constituents ask of us.   We failed and hardworking Americans lost.   It's time for politicians to have skin in the game. If we can't fund the government we shouldn't be paid. https://t.co/S1bjyW7d3p,2019-01-30 20:19:22,Twitter Web Client,22,88
I'm proud to cosponsor the #PaycheckFairness Act.  Ten years after the Lilly Ledbetter Act passed it's unacceptable that women are still battling the wage gap. It should go without saying that women deserve #EqualPay for equal work but we've still got a long way to go.,2019-01-30 20:03:12,Twitter for iPhone,12,52
Thank you @MASYouthCenter for inviting me to your reception last week. I want you to know that you always have a partner in me and my office.

Only in a town as broken as Washington do you still get paid when you don’t do your job. That’s wrong and it’s past time to make it right.  Proud to be working with @RepGolden @RepDanCrenshaw to bring some sense to this town. https://t.co/7yxKHpem4h,2019-01-29 22:20:36,Twitter for iPhone,25,123

We promised we’d show up we’d be different. We’re keeping that promise because it’s what you deserve. That's why we started "Max at your Door" &amp; it's why I spent this weekend knocking on doors from Mariner's Harbor to Oakwood to hear your concerns. https://t.co/bkN2Yojmjd,2019-01-28 19:08:36,Twitter for iPhone,27,104

But as @ADL_National reports we still have a long way to go. Anti-Semitism is on the rise and domestic extremists killed more people in the US in 2018 than 2017. We must stay vigilant in our efforts to root out hatred in all of its forms.,2019-01-27 16:43:33,Twitter for iPhone,17,78

So tell me again what was the point of this shutdown other than show just how absurdly broken Washington is?,2019-01-25 20:29:48,Twitter for iPhone,30,212
Hardworking men and women are working every day to serve their country and keep us safe paying for gas and tolls along the way without getting their paychecks.  These are not normal times. That's why I'm requesting E-Z Pass delay charging those affected by the shutdown. https://t.co/JWLvviHiyy,2019-01-24 22:42:28,Twitter for iPhone,10,47

The American people are sick and tired of corrupt loopholes designed for politicians and well-connected insiders to exploit on behalf of special interests and donors. This isn’t a partisan issue it’s an American issue. It’s time to close the #LobbyistLoophole. https://t.co/uYt6T9Xejl,2019-01-24 15:44:58,Twitter Web Client,22,63
If someone acts like a lobbyist and is paid like a lobbyist then they ought to register as a lobbyist. That’s why I’m fighting to close the #LobbyistLoophole https://t.co/rul5hmEPez,2019-01-24 15:19:19,Twitter Web Client,60,200
Special interests and federal lobbyists have been taking advantage of hard working Americans for far too long. It’s time we fight back.   That's why today I intro'd a bill to close the #LobbyistLoophole that Democrats and Republicans have exploited on behalf of special interests. https://t.co/4kdIHtrKVx,2019-01-24 15:13:05,Twitter Web Client,33,58
