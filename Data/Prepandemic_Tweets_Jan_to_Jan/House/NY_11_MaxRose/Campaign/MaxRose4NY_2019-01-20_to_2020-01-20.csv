What truly makes this a win-win for #NY11 is that the MTA has committed to increase investments for SI and S. Bklyn transportation.

Let’s be clear words matter: we were attacked by terrorists on 9/11. Thousands were murdered too many of whom were from my district.  But actions matter too.

Burn pits were a part of everyday life for soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan--they didn't have a choice. Now thousands of veterans are developing rare diseases and cancers that are likely a result of this exposure.

Our government failed and our national security was threatened. Donating my salary was the least I could do to stand in solidarity with those serving their country without pay. We have to be better. https://t.co/M1ECecsNoD,2019-02-04 23:34:53,Twitter for iPhone,23,143

What’s happening at #MDC is inhumane. I fully support @NydiaVelazquez and all those fighting for justice and action. Heat and power needs to return immediately and we need answers as to how this happened in the first place. Completely unacceptable.,2019-02-03 01:01:56,Twitter for iPhone,21,117

Such acts of hatred and anti-Semitism should have no place in our society but instead they're becoming all too common. This cannot be normal this cannot be accepted.

From Day 1 I’ve told the lobbyists and corporate PACs to keep their damn money. Now they’re scared that we’re sticking to our word and fighting to get corruption out of Washington. Unbelievable.  My message to them: bring it on.  https://t.co/R4WZFrN5Ue,2019-01-31 15:04:11,Twitter Web Client,36,137

I’m deeply concerned over the process and lack of transparency around the proposed homeless shelters on Staten Island. There have been far too many community stakeholders left out of these discussions. It’s insulting.  https://t.co/jXlfacCePy,2019-01-24 22:13:23,Twitter for iPhone,7,37
