V excited to attend my first SOTU and to hear from Stacey Abrams afterwards. She’s a thoughtful forceful voice in our party. Her focus on families and people charts a great path for Dems.,2019-02-05 18:17:50,Twitter for iPhone,23,455

That’s why I’m co-sponsoring the #PaycheckFairness Act — introduced today — to help women achieve #EqualPay.   https://t.co/IpfRxCAgf5,2019-01-29 20:43:50,Twitter for iPhone,17,89
Ten years on from the Lilly Ledbetter #Fairpay Act women still face a wage gap.   In NJ women make on average 82 cents for every dollar men make  — and its 58 cents for African-American women and 43 cents for Hispanic women.  #Ledbetter10,2019-01-29 20:38:42,Twitter for iPhone,105,264
All the work @Amtrak is putting into the Northeast Corridor will be in vain if the existing Hudson River Tunnel goes down.   I spoke to @business about why we need to invest in Gateway and what I’m doing in Congress to move the project forward. https://t.co/L4MoEPmdos,2019-01-29 14:47:59,Twitter for iPhone,30,154
Gateway is the most important infrastructure project in the country and requires urgent federal action. Today I joined the NJ Delegation on a tour of the Hudson River Tunnel and teamed up with @CoryBooker to talk about what we saw. https://t.co/hHvWDHvBkJ,2019-01-28 17:48:00,Twitter for iPhone,90,548
With the rise of anti-Semitism across the US we all have a duty to remember the horrors of the Holocaust — and must always stand up to bigotry and hatred. #HolocaustRemembranceDay,2019-01-27 16:00:57,Twitter for iPhone,298,1265
I’ve spoken to numerous Admirals and Generals and not one has raised the issue of transgender people serving in our military. If you want to serve this country risking death and are willing to take an oath to protect and defend our Constitution you should be able to do so.,2019-01-22 21:15:45,Twitter for iPhone,318,1377
