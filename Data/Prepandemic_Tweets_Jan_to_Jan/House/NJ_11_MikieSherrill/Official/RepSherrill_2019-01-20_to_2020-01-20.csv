The 2017 tax law violated more than 100 years of federal tax policy capping the SALT deduction at $10000—and married couples filing jointly are constrained to the same $10k level as individual filers.

@RepStefanik @RepPeteKing @RepGilCisneros In 2016 there were 108000 joint returns filed by Morris County residents. The average SALT deduction for Morris County was more than $23500.

@RepStefanik @RepPeteKing @RepGilCisneros The 2017 tax bill limited the SALT deduction to $10K and married couples filing jointly are harmed by having the same $10K cap as individuals.

Our veterans shouldn’t have to worry about whether they can make or keep their VA appointments because of lack of child care.
