In NY they actually lit up the One World Trade Center to “CELEBRATE” the passage of a bill that allows abortions to be performed right up to the moment of birth. In VA the gov advocated for a bill that allows abortion to be performed when the mother is “about to give birth.",2019-02-07 14:33:00,Twitter Web Client,3,4
I give @POTUS an A+ on last night’s State of the Union. It was interesting to me that Democrats didn’t express support for economic growth record low minority unemployment and a renewed resolve against socialism at last night’s #SOTU. https://t.co/YsS7JOnP3t,2019-02-06 21:52:14,Twitter for iPhone,3,12
Democrats' refusal to secure our border is out of step with America and certainly out of step with South Carolina! https://t.co/v6PZhmOBrm,2019-02-06 20:18:51,Twitter Web Client,2,7
Hopefully Democrats will answer President Trump's call to reject the politics of resistance so that we can continue to uplift all Americans.,2019-02-06 19:18:04,Twitter Web Client,0,1
It's just plain sad that Democrats won't join us in celebrating the successes our constituents are sharing or rise in support of the American values and freedoms we hold dear.,2019-02-06 19:18:03,Twitter Web Client,1,3
President Trump announced that we have achieved the lowest minority unemployment in decades. Radio silence from the Democrats. He renewed our resolve against socialism. We saw scowls across the aisle!,2019-02-06 19:18:03,Twitter Web Client,0,2
.@POTUS's call for unity in last night's #SOTU was inspiring and uplifting but unfortunately many Democrats refused to recognize our achievements or express support for policies that will move our country forward.,2019-02-06 19:18:03,Twitter Web Client,1,4

Rebuilding our nation’s infrastructure is a necessity. Congress needs to deliver an infrastructure plan that will allow essential shovel-ready projects like I-73 to get off the ground. @POTUS knows infrastructure is opportunity! #SOTU,2019-02-06 02:58:22,Twitter for iPhone,1,8

Excited to reflect on @POTUS's policy achievements that have transformed our economy &amp; created opportunities across the country. The State of our Union is stronger &amp; the American dream is more attainable because of his policies that have put Americans &amp; South Carolinians first. https://t.co/rgugt6Zxz3,2019-02-05 14:59:23,Twitter Web Client,0,5

Although I'm glad that government employees will receive temporary relief this effort will be in vain unless at the end of these three weeks we come to an agreement to fully fund border security provide disaster relief and reopen the government for the entire fiscal year.,2019-01-25 20:59:32,Twitter Web Client,3,8
Democrats are three for three on not paying furloughed government employees during the shutdown.

It's an opportunity to compromise and break this impasse so that we can reopen the government. She cannot continue to complain if she refuses to negotiate.  https://t.co/VqvtG8UlKm,2019-01-24 16:46:38,Twitter Web Client,1,2
Instead of offering the same doomed bill 11 times Speaker Pelosi should come to the negotiating table. President Trump put forward a good faith proposal rooted in bipartisanship. While it certainly isn't exactly what I wanted or what Mrs. Pelosi wanted it is a starting point.,2019-01-24 16:46:38,Twitter Web Client,1,13
Instead of participating in meaningful negotiations Speaker Pelosi wasted time bringing the same sham bill that includes $0 for border security to the House floor. It's time for her to work with the President instead of against the American people. Enough is Enough.,2019-01-23 23:37:46,Twitter Web Client,2,10

Democratic leadership should spend less time working against President Trump and more time working across the aisle to address the crisis at our southern border and reopen the government.,2019-01-22 17:04:43,Twitter Web Client,7,17
WATCH: "A bus in Mexico drops off dozens of migrants and then they simply walk across a stretch of the Arizona border."
