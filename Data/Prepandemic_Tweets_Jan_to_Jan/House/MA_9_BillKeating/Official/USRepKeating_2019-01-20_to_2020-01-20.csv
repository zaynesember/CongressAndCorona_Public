Unfortunately LGBTQ Americans still face discrimination in employment housing &amp; other core areas of life in more than half of the United States. I’m proud to be a co-sponsor of the #EqualityAct which has passed the House and is now off to the Senate.,2019-05-17 19:12:27,Twitter Web Client,0,11
Today marks the 15th Anniversary of marriage equality in Massachusetts - we should be proud of our Commonwealth’s continued leading role in the fight for equal rights for everyone. #mapoli https://t.co/WZB6twWptY,2019-05-17 19:12:26,Twitter Web Client,4,17
Last week @realdonaldtrump sent a racist tweet to derail our Wampanoag bill.  This week by an overwhelming majority we stood up for the basic rights of not just the Mashpee Wampanoag but all Native Americans.,2019-05-15 21:38:49,Twitter Web Client,14,42
Trump signed an identical bill last year. So why tweet against a bill recognizing the tribe of the first Thanksgiving? Because of his well-documented alliance with the RI casino lobbyist. A weak attempt to hide corrupt influence in a racist tweet.,2019-05-08 17:39:31,Twitter Web Client,6,16
Today marks Holocaust Remembrance Day - a day where we remember the six million Jews and millions of others who died simply because of who they were. We must recommit ourselves to never allowing such a global tragedy to occur again by focusing on peace and understanding.,2019-05-02 19:49:06,Twitter Web Client,2,12
While corporations and the wealthiest are getting a good amount of money back in their pockets the people who have given the most for this country are bearing the burden of the Trump tax cuts.,2019-05-01 13:19:12,Twitter for iPhone,5,4
These are the unintended consequences when a major piece of legislation is drafted behind closed doors without hearings oversight or input from the public.  The Trump tax plan is increasing taxes – by thousands of dollars – on our Gold Star families. https://t.co/FfW3FtqxYo,2019-05-01 13:19:12,Twitter for iPhone,9,8
As a former District Attorney the more I digest of the Mueller Report the harder it is to swallow:   ❌That a document with redactions on one third of its pages is transparent;  ❌That there wasn’t evidence of obstruction of justice.,2019-04-19 13:42:37,Twitter for iPhone,3,15
As a former District Attorney the more I digest of the Mueller Report the harder it is to swallow:   ❌That we can believe a presidential press secretary who admits under oath that she lies to the American public;,2019-04-19 13:42:36,Twitter for iPhone,3,14
As a former District Attorney the more I digest of the Mueller Report the harder it is to swallow:   ❌That we have an AG who represents the public as opposed to one individual;  ❌That the Russian attack on our democracy and the subsequent investigation were hoaxes;,2019-04-19 13:42:36,Twitter for iPhone,2,5
The President’s “Game Over” tweet is wrong.  Defending our values of justice impartiality and rule of law is not a “game.” And our responsibility to protect these values will never be over.,2019-04-19 13:42:35,Twitter for iPhone,6,24
As a former District Attorney I have seen the impacts of domestic violence up close. That’s why I brought the White Ribbon Pledge to Congress for the first time.,2019-04-04 21:06:53,Twitter Web Client,2,9
We have a fundamental responsibility as a Congress to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act and a moral responsibility to ensure that funding for it never lapses again. That’s why I am a proud co-sponsor of #VAWA19 which passed today. https://t.co/4etSL8bCmK,2019-04-04 21:06:53,Twitter Web Client,4,13
Providing the public with a summarized or sanitized version of the Mueller report would only compromise confidence in our democracy - the very thing this investigation is trying to protect.,2019-03-22 22:06:32,Twitter Web Client,5,13
The purpose of the Mueller investigation was to investigate threats and attacks to our democracy. The public should have full access to all the information in the Mueller report absent any material that would compromise intelligence sources or methods.,2019-03-22 22:06:31,Twitter Web Client,7,30
This week we’re going to introduce legislation to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act and restore net neutrality. We're also going to pass H.R. 1 – the For the People Act to work to restore the American people’s faith in our government. #VAWA #NetNeutrality,2019-03-05 17:01:59,Twitter Web Client,7,19

.@JunckerEU declares 25% of EU budget will go to mitigate climate change. Our friends in Europe again take two steps forward while we take two back.  The US should be leading the fight against climate change not focusing energies trying to debunk science. https://t.co/4FbTUMx4b9,2019-02-22 15:11:18,Twitter Web Client,46,88
Barnstable County Commissioner Ron Beaty’s hateful comments have no place in public discourse and are a disservice to the open and accepting community that so many have worked so hard to create on Cape Cod.,2019-02-20 19:50:34,Twitter Web Client,11,49

I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the #GreenNewDeal Resolution led in the House by @AOC and in the Senate by @SenMarkey. The time to act on the climate crisis is so long overdue.
