In Federalist No. 65 Hamilton does not warn—as Dershowitz and some Rs claim—that we should reject impeachment when parties clash over it. To the contrary Hamilton cites the inevitability of partisanship as a reason to support the Constitution’s approach to trying impeachments.,2020-01-19 21:55:58,Twitter for iPhone,9780,36424

Contrary to Pres. Trump’s claim it does matter whether there’s an imminent threat. It matters under our Constitution. A president can’t order any strikes except pursuant to a congressional authorization unless the strikes are emergency defensive responses to an imminent attack.,2020-01-14 16:55:47,Twitter for iPhone,9319,36038
The red herring here is from Bill Barr. When there is a campaign that involves repeated attacks on American targets then there is no excuse for the administration not to have sought an authorization from Congress as the Constitution demands. Otherwise imminence is required. https://t.co/4klbkPymaI,2020-01-13 23:12:48,Twitter for iPhone,3140,10264
More American troops are now in the Middle East than at the end of President Obama’s term. The rate of drone strikes is up too.  President Trump is not ending wars; he’s expanding them. He’s not bringing troops home; he’s sending them there.,2020-01-13 17:30:20,Twitter for iPhone,24444,67393

Matt Gaetz hasn’t changed his position on war powers. He had the same position when President Obama was in office. It’s the constitutionally conservative position.

The only alternatives in Syria are not perpetual U.S. presence or the current disaster. Our troops should have come home long ago.

Turkey is in NATO. Its president is visiting in Nov. It doesn’t invade Syria without the go-ahead. On 10/6 Pres. Trump gave the green light.

Donald Trump is a threat to liberty in America. He has grown government centralized power and undermined rights. He has promoted division and contempt. He appears increasingly unstable.

Anti-Semitism is always reprehensible and it’s perhaps most disturbing when it comes from the president of the United States. President Trump’s “disloyalty” comment mirrors divisive words that have come from members of Congress.

Trump’s presidency is the natural outcome of the not-my-side-ism that pervades today’s politics.

@keithhinkle Trump has not kept any such promises. He’s kept us in unauthorized wars. He’s expanded unconstitutional spying. He’s signed record amounts of wasteful spending. He’s promoted corporate welfare. He’s supported new federal crimes. And he’s authorized more abusive asset forfeiture.,2019-08-19 02:40:27,Twitter for iPhone,89,445

An important note for people talking about the federal budget:  Spending bills are valued over a one-year period. Tax bills are valued over a 10-year period.  In other words a $1.3T spending bill is 10x larger than a $1.3T tax bill. The spending bill has 10x the deficit impact.,2019-08-01 03:25:23,Twitter for iPhone,1753,5970

There are multiple better ways to structure the 9/11 VCF. The bill could require annual or biennial appropriations ensuring that Congress prioritize and account for spending. Alternatively Congress could fund a large defined endowment within the budget. Let's get it done.,2019-07-12 20:42:51,Twitter Web Client,107,838
This bill even excludes its spending from counting under budgetary rules. Unlimited automatic spending is convenient for current legislators who can take one popular vote and leave fiscal consequences to future generations. No program in government should operate this way.,2019-07-12 20:42:51,Twitter Web Client,80,673
Our Constitution empowers Congress to appropriate money. Typically this means we must vote annually to spend on a particular object. This process holds government accountable to the people. The 9/11 VCF works differently by authorizing 70+ years of unlimited automatic spending.,2019-07-12 20:42:51,Twitter Web Client,46,399
One of the main reasons government is not accountable is that politicians and media oversimplify discussions about legislation. A good example is the 9/11 VCF bill.

This afternoon I spoke on the House floor in support of my amendment to rein in FISA and protect Americans’ privacy and I noted the hypocrisy of Republican and Democratic leaders on this issue. Here’s a short clip: https://t.co/M4yay85YAG,2019-06-19 00:22:57,Twitter for iPhone,281,1336

Dozens of organizations from across the political spectrum including @ACLU @FreedomWorks @DemandProgress @EFF and @IndivisibleTeam support the Amash-Lofgren amendment to #HR2740 to limit the warrantless collection of Americans’ data under FISA 702. https://t.co/NMcgUO5bI2,2019-06-18 16:54:33,Twitter for iPhone,183,577

Our amendment upholds the Fourth Amendment by prohibiting the government from doing certain types of warrantless collections under FISA that unconstitutionally sweep up the private communications of countless law-abiding Americans. https://t.co/NNBTP0eS83,2019-06-17 23:25:12,Twitter for iPhone,145,775
FISA 702 allows the government to warrantlessly collect a massive amount of data. In doing so it collects communications of Americans which can be searched without a warrant and used in criminal prosecutions. This violates Americans’ Fourth Amendment-secured rights.,2019-06-17 23:25:09,Twitter for iPhone,164,734
AS SOON AS TUESDAY EVENING the House will be voting on the Amash-Lofgren amendment to limit the warrantless collection of Americans’ communications (including content) under Sec. 702 of FISA.,2019-06-17 23:25:09,Twitter for iPhone,459,2490
If the administration is serious about FISA abuse then they’ll support my amendment to rein in FISA—to better ensure that the government protects the privacy of all Americans in accordance with the Constitution.,2019-06-16 23:15:28,Twitter for iPhone,166,917
Because the White House prevented us from fixing these issues last year this week I’m offering an amendment to #HR2740 to narrow the government’s collections under FISA limiting the warrantless gathering of Americans’ communications.,2019-06-16 23:15:28,Twitter for iPhone,110,709
The 2018 bill reauthorized Sec. 702 of FISA for six years—a section that allows for the warrantless collection of Americans’ communications. In his statement after signing the bill Pres. Trump’s only criticism was that he’d prefer that the bill reauthorize Sec. 702 permanently.,2019-06-16 23:15:28,Twitter for iPhone,57,250
In 2018 we voted on FISA 702 and I offered an amendment to limit warrantless collection of Americans’ communications. Instead of supporting that amendment the White House issued a veto threat and Trump ultimately signed a FISA 702 bill that creates even more privacy problems.,2019-06-16 23:15:27,Twitter for iPhone,63,268
The Trump administration’s narrative allows the White House to complain about FISA abuse while at the same time fighting those of us in Congress who are actually trying to change the laws to prevent unconstitutional spying on Americans.,2019-06-16 23:15:27,Twitter for iPhone,83,331
The White House is undermining this effort to fight unconstitutional surveillance by instead framing surveillance concerns as a problem with particular individuals at the FBI as if protecting Americans’ rights is just about hiring the right personnel instead of changing FISA.,2019-06-16 23:15:27,Twitter for iPhone,76,335
The reason for this focus is obvious: We can’t guarantee the government will always hire employees who will respect the people’s rights so we have to ensure that the law prevents whoever is in government from violating the Constitution or acting without sufficient oversight.,2019-06-16 23:15:27,Twitter for iPhone,68,333
Our primary concern has never been about particular individuals in government who use surveillance authorities; our focus is on limiting the authorities and adding safeguards so that Americans’ rights are protected *regardless* of who in government is doing the surveillance.,2019-06-16 23:15:26,Twitter for iPhone,67,318
Since before the Trump administration I’ve been leading a bipartisan coalition in Congress fighting the government’s efforts to expand the ability of agencies like the FBI and NSA to collect Americans’ communications without a warrant.,2019-06-16 23:15:26,Twitter for iPhone,69,325
This is part of a long-running effort to reform FISA and the Patriot Act—an effort that is being undermined by the Trump administration. Later this year we’ll have an opportunity to challenge Sec. 215 of the Patriot Act.,2019-06-16 23:15:26,Twitter for iPhone,79,329
Last year President Trump signed into law a bill to give the FBI and NSA extraordinary powers to warrantlessly collect Americans’ communications under Sec. 702 of FISA.

@kyledcheney 1. No such thing as a “civil” contempt resolution. 2. Criminal prosecution for contempt of Congress requires actual contempt vote. 3. Unlike contempt today’s res authorizes lawsuits. 4.

Likely an honest mistake on @kyledcheney’s part but since I’m getting a lot of questions about it you should know that his description of the vote is inaccurate. It was not a vote to hold anyone in contempt. Here’s what it actually does and why it’s bad: https://t.co/QS8F3c04FG https://t.co/45ggTkoQdl,2019-06-12 00:10:32,Twitter for iPhone,153,568
House rules aren’t clear on whether a vote of the House is required to authorize these lawsuits but that’s been our practice. #HRes430 instead says that a vote of House leadership to authorize these lawsuits “is the equivalent of a vote of the full House of Representatives.”,2019-06-11 23:00:13,Twitter for iPhone,131,663
#HRes430 isn’t a contempt resolution; it authorizes Rep. Nadler to file lawsuits to enforce specific subpoenas but unfortunately shifts to leadership the power to authorize future enforcement lawsuits further centralizing the House’s authority and undermining the institution.,2019-06-11 23:00:13,Twitter for iPhone,207,952

The president and his allies are instead trying to excuse Trump’s efforts to obstruct the entire investigation into Russian election interference by alleging problems with elements of it and claiming without basis that they undermine Mueller’s obstruction analysis.,2019-06-07 20:30:17,Twitter for iPhone,1960,8897
And with Mueller’s report now out the White House no longer has anything positive to say about Mueller and his team.,2019-06-07 20:30:17,Twitter for iPhone,1242,6704
But as we later found out Mueller’s report is damning for the president. If Barr’s letter had accurately reflected the report the White House would not have reacted positively.,2019-06-07 20:30:16,Twitter for iPhone,1561,7485
When Barr’s letter came out the White House abruptly changed its tone. Trump said “the Mueller report was great” and that Mueller had acted honorably and he touted the report as a “total exoneration.” Kellyanne Conway referred to the investigation as “the gold standard.”,2019-06-07 20:30:16,Twitter for iPhone,1303,5869
The White House’s reaction to Barr’s letter is also telling. Trump had long been harshly critical of Mueller and his investigation calling him “totally conflicted” and “disgraced and discredited” and the investigation “illegal” and a “rigged witch hunt.”,2019-06-07 20:30:15,Twitter for iPhone,972,4957
Mueller wrote that it would be improper for him to conclude that Trump should be charged given that he could not actually charge him because it would put a criminal accusation over the president’s head with no opportunity for a formal defense.,2019-06-07 20:30:15,Twitter for iPhone,1059,5204
It’s not that Mueller couldn’t make up his mind chose not to make a decision and then said Trump wasn’t exonerated; rather Mueller had decided that it was inappropriate to make a determination as to whether Trump had committed a crime and he sought to make that fact clearer.,2019-06-07 20:30:12,Twitter for iPhone,1120,5666
But in context—which Barr fails to provide—Mueller’s declaration makes more sense.,2019-06-07 20:30:11,Twitter for iPhone,881,5323
Here’s the tweet expressing my displeasure: https://t.co/IRLnon6v14,2019-06-07 20:30:11,Twitter for iPhone,760,4087
Because it was unclear why Mueller chose not to decide whether to charge the president with a crime I was unhappy about this line from Mueller quoted by Barr: “while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime it also does not exonerate him.”,2019-06-07 20:30:10,Twitter for iPhone,960,5009
Barr doesn’t even mention that because of the DoJ opinion Mueller believed that charging a sitting president with a crime was not an option; Barr only cites the DoJ opinion in a footnote when describing his own analysis not Mueller’s analysis.,2019-06-07 20:30:10,Twitter for iPhone,1172,5836
Note that my March 24 tweet doesn’t even mention obstruction. That’s because Barr’s letter falsely implies Mueller looked at the evidence and simply could not decide whether Trump should be indicted because of legal and factual issues regarding whether his actions were criminal.,2019-06-07 20:30:09,Twitter for iPhone,1232,6073
Mueller explains that prudential concerns and an official DoJ opinion prevented him from indicting the president and then because it would be unfair to accuse the president of a crime without actually charging him Mueller declined to decide whether Trump had committed a crime.,2019-06-07 20:30:09,Twitter for iPhone,1350,6521
Mueller’s report describes acts of obstruction by President Trump and it clearly says Mueller chose not to decide whether Trump had committed a crime because Mueller was prohibited from actually charging him.,2019-06-07 20:30:08,Twitter for iPhone,2103,8749

Barr has so far successfully used his position to sell the president’s false narrative to the American people. This will continue if those who have read the report do not start pushing back on his misrepresentations and share the truth.,2019-05-28 16:30:12,Twitter for iPhone,11654,39068
Ultimately the special counsel “recogniz[ed] that the President would not be interviewed voluntarily” and chose not to subpoena him because of concerns that the resulting “potentially lengthy constitutional litigation” would delay completion of the investigation.,2019-05-28 16:30:11,Twitter for iPhone,3911,18080
The president instead gave written answers to questions submitted by the special counsel. Those answers are often incomplete or unresponsive. Mueller found them “inadequate” and again sought to interview the president.,2019-05-28 16:30:11,Twitter for iPhone,3728,16865
The report says the president’s counsel was told that interviewing him was “vital” to Mueller’s investigation and that it would be in the interest of the public and the presidency. Still Trump refused.,2019-05-28 16:30:11,Twitter for iPhone,3793,16233
Barr says the White House “fully cooperated” with the investigation and that Mueller “never sought” or “pushed” to get more from the president but the report says Mueller unsuccessfully sought an interview with the president for over a year.,2019-05-28 16:30:10,Twitter for iPhone,4160,17315
It’s wrong to suggest that the fact that Mueller did not choose to indict anyone for this means there wasn’t a basis to investigate whether it amounted to a crime or “collusion” or whether it was in fact part of Russia’s efforts to help Trump’s candidacy.,2019-05-28 16:30:10,Twitter for iPhone,3113,15271
For instance Trump Jr. Paul Manafort and Jared Kushner took a meeting with a Russian lawyer whom Trump Jr. had been told worked for the Russian government and would provide documents to “incriminate Hillary” as part of the Russian government’s “support for Mr. Trump.”,2019-05-28 16:30:10,Twitter for iPhone,3479,15816
In truth Mueller’s report describes concerning contacts between members of Trump’s campaign and people in or connected to the Russian government.,2019-05-28 16:30:09,Twitter for iPhone,3683,16227
But whether there’s enough evidence for a conviction of a specific crime which Mueller thought was appropriate to charge is a different and much higher standard than whether the people whom Mueller investigated had done anything worthy of investigation.,2019-05-28 16:30:09,Twitter for iPhone,2698,14240
Barr notes that Mueller did not “find any conspiracy to violate U.S. law involving Russia-linked persons and any persons associated with the Trump campaign.” He then declares that Mueller found “no collusion” and implies falsely that the investigation was baseless.,2019-05-28 16:30:08,Twitter for iPhone,2860,14378
In subsequent statements and testimony Barr used further misrepresentations to help build the president’s false narrative that the investigation was unjustified.,2019-05-28 16:30:08,Twitter for iPhone,3065,14889
Barr absurdly replied: “No I don’t…I suspect that they probably wanted more put out.” Yet Mueller had directly raised those concerns to Barr and Barr says he “suspect[s]” they “probably” wanted more materials put out as if Mueller hadn’t directly told him that.,2019-05-28 16:30:08,Twitter for iPhone,3104,15676
Barr was asked about reports “that members of [Mueller’s] team are frustrated…with the limited information included in your March 24th letter that it does not adequately or accurately necessarily portray the report’s findings. Do you know what they’re referencing with that?”,2019-05-28 16:30:07,Twitter for iPhone,2779,14161
Barr declined; he allowed the confusion to fester and only released the materials three weeks later with the full redacted report. In the interim Barr testified before a House committee and was misleading about his knowledge of Mueller’s concerns:,2019-05-28 16:30:07,Twitter for iPhone,3039,15147
To “alleviate the misunderstandings that have arisen” Mueller urged the release of the report’s introductions and executive summaries which he had told Barr “accurately summarize [Mueller’s] Office’s work and conclusions.”,2019-05-28 16:30:07,Twitter for iPhone,3027,14954
Mueller: “There is now public confusion about critical aspects of the results of our investigation. This threatens to undermine a central purpose for which the Department appointed the Special Counsel: to assure full public confidence in the outcome of the investigations.”,2019-05-28 16:30:06,Twitter for iPhone,3255,15673
As a result of Barr’s March 24 letter the public and Congress were misled. Mueller himself notes this in a March 27 letter to Barr saying that Barr’s letter “did not fully capture the context nature and substance of this Office’s work and conclusions.”,2019-05-28 16:30:06,Twitter for iPhone,3680,16551
But Mueller’s quote is taken from a section in which he describes other improper motives Trump could have had and notes: “The injury to the integrity of the justice system is the same regardless of whether a person committed an underlying wrong.” None of that is in Barr’s letter.,2019-05-28 16:30:06,Twitter for iPhone,3357,16295
Barr quotes Mueller saying the evidence didn’t establish that Trump was personally involved in crimes related to Russian election interference and Barr then claims that Mueller found that fact relevant to whether the president had the intent to obstruct justice.,2019-05-28 16:30:05,Twitter for iPhone,2716,14221
In noting why Barr thought the president’s intent in impeding the investigation was insufficient to establish obstruction Barr selectively quotes Mueller to make it sound as if his analysis was much closer to Barr’s analysis than it actually was:,2019-05-28 16:30:05,Twitter for iPhone,3044,15692
But in fact Mueller finds considerable evidence that several of Trump’s actions detailed in the report meet the elements of obstruction and Mueller’s constitutional and prudential issues with indicting a sitting president would preclude indictment regardless of what he found.,2019-05-28 16:30:04,Twitter for iPhone,3904,17942
Barr’s letter doesn’t mention those issues when explaining why Mueller chose not to make a prosecutorial decision. He instead selectively quotes Mueller in a way that makes it sound—falsely—as if Mueller’s decision stemmed from legal/factual issues specific to Trump’s actions.,2019-05-28 16:30:04,Twitter for iPhone,3953,18874
Mueller’s report says he chose not to decide whether Trump broke the law because there’s an official DoJ opinion that indicting a sitting president is unconstitutional and because of concerns about impacting the president’s ability to govern and pre-empting possible impeachment.,2019-05-28 16:30:03,Twitter for iPhone,3597,17402
After receiving Mueller’s report Barr wrote and released a letter on March 24 describing Barr’s own decision not to indict the president for obstruction of justice. That letter selectively quotes and summarizes points in Mueller’s report in misleading ways.,2019-05-28 16:30:03,Twitter for iPhone,4196,19690
Attorney General Barr has deliberately misrepresented key aspects of Mueller’s report and decisions in the investigation which has helped further the president’s false narrative about the investigation.,2019-05-28 16:30:02,Twitter for iPhone,31155,89842
Grateful to all who sacrificed their lives defending liberty and the Constitution. May their memories be eternal and may God bless their families and other loved ones.,2019-05-27 14:40:45,Twitter for iPhone,1057,8926
.@POTUS is (again) going around Congress—this time to unilaterally approve billions in arms sales including to the brutal Saudi regime. Congress must reclaim its powers. When will the legislative branch stand up to the executive branch? https://t.co/OInOaSO0YJ,2019-05-24 19:30:19,Twitter for iPhone,13883,38285
The president has authority to fire federal officials direct his subordinates and grant pardons but he cannot do so for corrupt purposes; otherwise he would always be allowed to shut down any investigation into himself or his associates which would put him above the law.,2019-05-23 17:00:29,Twitter for iPhone,5648,23771
Some of the president’s actions were inherently corrupt. Other actions were corrupt—and therefore impeachable—because the president took them to serve his own interests.,2019-05-23 17:00:28,Twitter for iPhone,4595,19437
Both men have been convicted for offering false information and Manafort’s lack of cooperation left open some significant questions such as why exactly he provided an associate in Ukraine with campaign polling data which he expected to be shared with a Russian oligarch.,2019-05-23 17:00:28,Twitter for iPhone,2763,13420
Manafort ultimately breached an agreement to cooperate with investigators and Cohen offered false testimony to Congress including denying that the Trump Tower Moscow project had extended to June 2016 and that he and Trump had discussed traveling to Russia during the campaign.,2019-05-23 17:00:27,Twitter for iPhone,2438,12511
Trump through his own statements—such as complaining about people who "flip" and talk to investigators—and through communications between his personal counsel and Manafort/Cohen gave the impression that they would be pardoned if they did not fully cooperate with investigators.,2019-05-23 17:00:27,Twitter for iPhone,2646,13160
6. Trump used his pardon power to influence his associates including Paul Manafort and Michael Cohen not to fully cooperate with the investigation.,2019-05-23 17:00:26,Twitter for iPhone,2797,13481
5. Trump asked Corey Lewandowski his former campaign manager to tell AG Sessions to limit the special counsel’s investigation only to future election interference. Trump said Lewandowski should tell Sessions he was fired if he would not meet with him.,2019-05-23 17:00:26,Twitter for iPhone,3145,14127
4. When that event was publicly reported Trump asked that McGahn make a public statement and create a false internal record stating that Trump had not asked him to fire the special counsel and suggested that McGahn would be fired if he did not comply.,2019-05-23 17:00:25,Twitter for iPhone,2641,12948
3. Trump directed the White House counsel Don McGahn to have Special Counsel Mueller removed on the basis of pretextual conflicts of interest that Trump’s advisers had already told him were “ridiculous” and could not justify removing the special counsel.,2019-05-23 17:00:24,Twitter for iPhone,2507,12609
2. After AG Sessions recused himself from the Russian investigation on the advice of DoJ ethics lawyers Trump directly asked Sessions to reverse his recusal so that he could retain control over the investigation and help the president.,2019-05-23 17:00:24,Twitter for iPhone,2477,12602
1. Trump asked the FBI director to stop investigating Michael Flynn who had been his campaign adviser and national security adviser and who had already committed a crime by lying to the FBI.,2019-05-23 17:00:23,Twitter for iPhone,2713,13188
Some examples in Mueller’s report of the president’s obstructing and impeding the investigation include:,2019-05-23 17:00:23,Twitter for iPhone,2868,12343
Some excuse Trump’s conduct based on allegations of issues with the investigation but no one disputes the appropriateness of investigating election interference which included investigating contacts between the Trump campaign and people connected to the Russian government.,2019-05-23 17:00:22,Twitter for iPhone,2176,12134
The investigation began before the president was elected and inaugurated. After Trump assumed the powers of the presidency Mueller’s report shows that he used those powers to try to obstruct and impede the investigation.,2019-05-23 17:00:22,Twitter for iPhone,3111,14206
It also revealed criminal activities some of which were committed by people in Trump’s orbit and in the case of Michael Cohen’s campaign finance violation on Trump’s behalf.,2019-05-23 17:00:21,Twitter for iPhone,2422,13139
The investigation threatened to uncover information including criminal activity that could put Trump’s interests at risk. Ultimately the investigation did uncover very unflattering information about the president his family his associates his campaign and his business.,2019-05-23 17:00:21,Twitter for iPhone,2492,13118
President Trump had an incentive to undermine the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election which included investigating contacts between Russia and the Trump campaign.,2019-05-23 17:00:20,Twitter for iPhone,2398,12943
This principle extends to all the president’s powers including the authority over federal investigations federal officials and pardons.,2019-05-23 17:00:20,Twitter for iPhone,2137,12790
The president has an obligation not to violate the public trust including using official powers for corrupt purposes. For instance presidents have the authority to nominate judges but a president couldn’t select someone to nominate because they’d promised the president money.,2019-05-23 17:00:19,Twitter for iPhone,3432,16568
Mueller’s report describes a consistent effort by the president to use his office to obstruct or otherwise corruptly impede the Russian election interference investigation because it put his interests at risk.,2019-05-23 17:00:17,Twitter for iPhone,23533,70572
In fact “high Crimes and Misdemeanors” is not defined in the Constitution and does not require corresponding statutory charges. The context implies conduct that violates the public trust—and that view is echoed by the Framers of the Constitution and early American scholars.,2019-05-20 18:00:30,Twitter for iPhone,5114,26919
4. They imply “high Crimes and Misdemeanors” requires charges of a statutory crime or misdemeanor.,2019-05-20 18:00:29,Twitter for iPhone,2239,14793
In fact the president could not have known whether every single person Mueller investigated did or did not commit any crimes.,2019-05-20 18:00:29,Twitter for iPhone,2177,15753
3. They imply the president should be permitted to use any means to end what he claims to be a frivolous investigation no matter how unreasonable his claim.,2019-05-20 18:00:28,Twitter for iPhone,2041,14404
If an underlying crime were required then prosecutors could charge obstruction of justice only if it were unsuccessful in completely obstructing the investigation. This would make no sense.,2019-05-20 18:00:28,Twitter for iPhone,2638,18168
In fact obstruction of justice does not require the prosecution of an underlying crime and there is a logical reason for that. Prosecutors might not charge a crime precisely *because* obstruction of justice denied them timely access to evidence that could lead to a prosecution.,2019-05-20 18:00:27,Twitter for iPhone,4109,22887
2. They say obstruction of justice requires an underlying crime.,2019-05-20 18:00:27,Twitter for iPhone,1850,13679
In fact there were many crimes revealed by the investigation some of which were charged and some of which were not but are nonetheless described in Mueller’s report.,2019-05-20 18:00:26,Twitter for iPhone,3312,19729
1. They say there were no underlying crimes.,2019-05-20 18:00:26,Twitter for iPhone,2023,14230
People who say there were no underlying crimes and therefore the president could not have intended to illegally obstruct the investigation—and therefore cannot be impeached—are resting their argument on several falsehoods:,2019-05-20 18:00:25,Twitter for iPhone,23605,76302
America’s institutions depend on officials to uphold both the rules and spirit of our constitutional system even when to do so is personally inconvenient or yields a politically unfavorable outcome. Our Constitution is brilliant and awesome; it deserves a government to match it.,2019-05-18 19:30:26,Twitter for iPhone,15823,72746
Few members of Congress even read Mueller’s report; their minds were made up based on partisan affiliation—and it showed with representatives and senators from both parties issuing definitive statements on the 448-page report’s conclusions within just hours of its release.,2019-05-18 19:30:26,Twitter for iPhone,10977,53299
We’ve witnessed members of Congress from both parties shift their views 180 degrees—on the importance of character on the principles of obstruction of justice—depending on whether they’re discussing Bill Clinton or Donald Trump.,2019-05-18 19:30:25,Twitter for iPhone,8218,44401
Our system of checks and balances relies on each branch’s jealously guarding its powers and upholding its duties under our Constitution. When loyalty to a political party or to an individual trumps loyalty to the Constitution the Rule of Law—the foundation of liberty—crumbles.,2019-05-18 19:30:25,Twitter for iPhone,12225,55345
While impeachment should be undertaken only in extraordinary circumstances the risk we face in an environment of extreme partisanship is not that Congress will employ it as a remedy too often but rather that Congress will employ it so rarely that it cannot deter misconduct.,2019-05-18 19:30:25,Twitter for iPhone,10256,51422
Impeachment which is a special form of indictment does not even require probable cause that a crime (e.g. obstruction of justice) has been committed; it simply requires a finding that an official has engaged in careless abusive corrupt or otherwise dishonorable conduct.,2019-05-18 19:30:25,Twitter for iPhone,11775,54165
In fact Mueller’s report identifies multiple examples of conduct satisfying all the elements of obstruction of justice and undoubtedly any person who is not the president of the United States would be indicted based on such evidence.,2019-05-18 19:30:25,Twitter for iPhone,10952,52040
Contrary to Barr’s portrayal Mueller’s report reveals that President Trump engaged in specific actions and a pattern of behavior that meet the threshold for impeachment.,2019-05-18 19:30:24,Twitter for iPhone,14578,61766
Under our Constitution the president “shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for and Conviction of Treason Bribery or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.” While “high Crimes and Misdemeanors” is not defined the context implies conduct that violates the public trust.,2019-05-18 19:30:24,Twitter for iPhone,10617,51117
Barr’s misrepresentations are significant but often subtle frequently taking the form of sleight-of-hand qualifications or logical fallacies which he hopes people will not notice.,2019-05-18 19:30:24,Twitter for iPhone,10000,50561
In comparing Barr’s principal conclusions congressional testimony and other statements to Mueller’s report it is clear that Barr intended to mislead the public about Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s analysis and findings.,2019-05-18 19:30:24,Twitter for iPhone,12883,57263
I offer these conclusions only after having read Mueller’s redacted report carefully and completely having read or watched pertinent statements and testimony and having discussed this matter with my staff who thoroughly reviewed materials and provided me with further analysis.,2019-05-18 19:30:23,Twitter for iPhone,10089,53783
Here are my principal conclusions: 1. Attorney General Barr has deliberately misrepresented Mueller’s report. 2. President Trump has engaged in impeachable conduct. 3. Partisanship has eroded our system of checks and balances. 4. Few members of Congress have read the report.,2019-05-18 19:30:23,Twitter for iPhone,79257,224835

Every time you hear about U.S.-imposed tariffs remember that they are taxes on Americans. @POTUS is boasting that he loves collecting big taxes on Americans. https://t.co/E2HP4pHLMC,2019-05-12 02:56:04,Twitter for iPhone,7822,22255
Americans can’t avoid the economic losses caused by tariffs. Tariffs decrease competition and increase the competitive price of goods and services. Even firms that produce entirely domestically face higher input costs. These factors hurt all Americans while benefiting only a few. https://t.co/5I5HL9cBN6,2019-05-10 20:20:30,Twitter for iPhone,1183,4247
Tariffs are being paid to the U.S. government by Americans. These “massive payments” as @POTUS calls them are literally paid to the Treasury by U.S. companies in most instances and the costs are passed on partly or wholly to American consumers. It’s a tax hike on Americans. https://t.co/v2Ii4Z9f9C,2019-05-10 15:56:39,Twitter for iPhone,1968,5315

@jesse_brodkin @_AuberonHerbert @sahilkapur @PoliticalKel I claim liberty to be the highest virtue. The fact I have contributed least to deficits and the debt is simply a byproduct of my dedication to liberty.,2019-05-04 00:55:15,Twitter for iPhone,4,20
@jesse_brodkin @_AuberonHerbert @sahilkapur @PoliticalKel If that’s a bad faith argument then it cuts both ways. Members of Congress shouldn’t vote for spending (especially spending increases) when they know there aren’t the requisite revenues to cover the spending.,2019-05-04 00:15:08,Twitter for iPhone,0,7
@jesse_brodkin @sahilkapur @PoliticalKel I acknowledged such when I voted for it. But why focus your criticism on the person in Congress who has contributed least to deficits and the debt? I replied to Sahil because he made an easily verifiable false statement. Centrist Democrats are not the top deficit hawks.,2019-05-04 00:10:19,Twitter for iPhone,0,16
@jesse_brodkin @sahilkapur @PoliticalKel Your math is wrong. I didn’t vote for the $4T. I’ve voted for a net spending cut during my time in Congress while others have voted for trillions in net spending increases.,2019-05-03 23:55:56,Twitter for iPhone,4,22
@sahilkapur @PoliticalKel Just do the math. If you’re suggesting I’m not the biggest deficit hawk then you’re wrong—even with the tax cut. The tax law is roughly $150B/year. Every few months centrist Democrats (and most others) vote for spending far exceeding that figure. Our annual budget is over $4T.,2019-05-03 23:18:34,Twitter for iPhone,4,23

The rules were designed to facilitate public disclosure without threatening privacy or undermining a special counsel by requiring him to produce a public report.

But if Congress insists now before the report has been written that the entire report be released we effectively shift to Mueller the decisions about what to release publicly.,2019-03-14 20:15:25,Twitter for iPhone,10,54

Congress should (and I will) work to repeal laws that ostensibly grant legislative powers to the president.

My point was that the wall funding is relatively small and everyone knows the president really means enhanced fencing which Democrats have previously supported.,2019-01-26 04:44:54,Twitter for iPhone,0,4
The clearest sign of lessons not learned is that only a few people are negotiating whatever comes next. That’s not how our system is supposed to work. Open up Congress. Let us consider new ideas. Let us deliberate. Let us legislate. Until that happens things will not get better.,2019-01-26 03:12:29,Twitter for iPhone,166,849
These spending bills are massive and wasteful but nobody talks about that. @POTUS and most of Congress made the fight all about the wall. After five weeks of shutdown we’re left with the same irresponsible bills no wall and seemingly zero lessons learned. What was the point?,2019-01-26 02:25:30,Twitter for iPhone,436,1709

It’s amazing that Wilbur Ross was nominated and confirmed to be secretary of anything. He’s shown over many years that he doesn’t understand basic economics and to describe him as out of touch would be an understatement.,2019-01-25 03:15:19,Twitter for iPhone,806,4354
@RepMoolenaar @ungroundedvolts Thanks @RepMoolenaar. Eric you mischaracterized his post.,2019-01-25 00:20:30,Twitter for iPhone,0,7
@ungroundedvolts He’s wrong. There have been no amendments. He may be referring to a motion to recommit which is not an amendment though the minority party often acts like it is one for political purposes.,2019-01-24 22:09:38,Twitter for iPhone,0,3
@lissie_w You have a vote on it and then it passes or fails. That’s how our system is supposed to work.,2019-01-24 21:49:47,Twitter for iPhone,3,28
@marleymartoyou No that was not his job. @SpeakerRyan’s job was to guarantee an open process that ensured a diversity of ideas would be considered. He totally failed and now @SpeakerPelosi is failing too. She has allowed zero amendments.,2019-01-24 21:44:58,Twitter for iPhone,7,30
The primary reason the government is partially shut down is that @senatemajldr and @SpeakerPelosi (and @SpeakerRyan before her) will not allow Congress to work as a deliberative body. Let legislators legislate—let us amend bills—and then @POTUS can decide whether to sign or veto.,2019-01-24 21:18:41,Twitter for iPhone,269,1004

@ColMorrisDavis I didn’t say it binds Congress into perpetuity; I said it contains a *current* statement of policy that “reject[s] any efforts” to substantially change this alliance anytime. I support NATO (see https://t.co/32GQTenz9t) but this bill includes reckless policy I can’t support.,2019-01-24 03:16:07,Twitter for iPhone,1,8
@ColMorrisDavis This “comrade” stuff is classic demagoguery. Maybe try reading the bills and appreciate that a member of Congress actually does.

@cabbageguy I can’t thank you enough for supporting me when I was just starting out. You are within your rights to challenge me as your representative and I take no offense.

@cabbageguy It’s not true anyone can vote against bills. Our government keeps growing precisely because others can’t stop voting for this crap. I have made a difference even if my position doesn’t always prevail. Only the public can force Congress to change; no single member can fix it.,2019-01-23 20:10:56,Twitter for iPhone,2,66
@cabbageguy Okay then what’s your point?,2019-01-23 19:33:06,Twitter for iPhone,0,26

Constitution bars @POTUS from unilaterally withdrawing from NATO: “Treaties being declared equally with the laws of the U. States to be the supreme law of the land it is understood that an act of the legislature alone can declare them infringed and rescinded.” —T.

Some say a congressman shouldn’t object that a bill applies indefinitely b/c a future Congress can override it. My job is not to consider what a future Congress may (not) do; I object to a *current* statement of policy that “reject[s] any efforts” unconditionally into the future.,2019-01-23 16:16:25,Twitter for iPhone,56,433
Yesterday the House voted on an extreme misguided measure regarding NATO. This bill doesn’t simply instruct @POTUS he can’t withdraw without congressional approval; rather it includes a blanket rejection of *any* proposal *ever* to Congress to alter this alliance. I voted no.,2019-01-23 15:21:00,Twitter for iPhone,288,1184

Ways to break shutdown stalemate: 1. @SpeakerPelosi and @senatemajldr open up process allow amendment votes and send compromise to president to sign or veto or 2. @POTUS agrees to sign one-week CR every week while parties negotiate.  First is best but unlikely. Second is easy.,2019-01-21 01:42:21,Twitter for iPhone,111,498

@iford99 No I’d vote against this proposal as I stated in my tweet. I’m saying that Democrats are exaggerating how much they dislike this proposal. It’s not that different from countless bills they’ve supported in the past.,2019-01-20 16:08:32,Twitter for iPhone,0,3
