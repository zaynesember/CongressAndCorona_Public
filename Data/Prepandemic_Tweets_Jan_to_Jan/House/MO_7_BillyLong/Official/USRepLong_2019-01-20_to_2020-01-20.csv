Why does @SpeakerPelosi keep holding up a deal that both Dems and @HouseGOP believe is good for the American people?   She hopes "that we're on a path to yes" when it comes to #USMCA.

Dems are planning a vote next week on holding AG Barr in contempt for not releasing the unredacted #MuellerReport demanding that the AG violate federal law by releasing grand jury information.

It is unbelievable that our current immigration system is so flawed that migrants are borrowing and renting children like they're a commodity in order to make it easier to stay in the United States.

My friends @SteveScalise and @repgregwalden wrote a great piece for @FoxNews that is definitely worth a read. Medicare for all would not only be unsustainable and costly it would be overtly anti-life. https://t.co/Ck4BgIHWs5,2019-06-06 18:44:32,Twitter Web Client,94,232

I visited @CoxHealth this morning for a round-table discussion about the #OpioidCrisis and toured the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. It was heart wrenching to see babies affected by opioid addiction.

When former President Obama announced DACA he stated the following:  "This is not amnesty this is not immunity this is not a path to citizenship it's not a permanent fix."  House Democrats seemed to have forgotten this with the passage of the #amnesty bill H.R. 6.,2019-06-06 14:27:17,Twitter Web Client,3,3
This past week the House Dems passed H.R. 6 a mass #amnesty to people whose deportation action was supposed to be deferred and whose status we were told was temporary. This political stunt is not a real solution to our #immigration problem and is dead on arrival in the Senate.,2019-06-06 13:26:58,Twitter Web Client,1,5
