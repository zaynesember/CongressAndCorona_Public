Voter ID laws are discriminatory. Studies show Voter ID laws put in place higher hurdles for Americans to vote. The America Votes Act will help remove these hurdles. https://t.co/tI8JiSjsT0,2019-01-31 16:12:15,Twitter Web Client,8,38

Why do these claims matter? @realDonaldTrump is ignoring intel advice of US govt. In Congress Ds &amp; Rs are willing to work together on many of these fronts. POTUS denial/minimizing threats makes it harder to prepare. Having a strategy is good. Acting strategically is better. 6/6,2019-01-30 00:38:43,Twitter for iPhone,7,18
On Russia @realDonaldTrump has denied Moscow’s interference in the 2016 election despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. The Intelligence Community assesses that the threat from Russia against U.S. elections continues (5/6) https://t.co/87ruf3Vsgc,2019-01-30 00:37:56,Twitter for iPhone,3,9
On climate change @realDonaldTrump withdrew from the Paris Climate Accord and has actually asked for global warming to “come back fast.” The Intelligence Community (and scientific community) disagrees (4/6) https://t.co/EjDEv0Phum,2019-01-30 00:36:40,Twitter for iPhone,3,7

In May 2018 @realDonaldTrump violated the Iran Nuclear Deal saying that it was “one of the worst and most one-sided transactions.” The Intelligence Community disagrees (2/6) https://t.co/6UsEfnLVnb,2019-01-30 00:19:16,Twitter for iPhone,4,10
The president has a history of making false/misleading claims. On many national security issues it seems @realDonaldTrump gets ideas from TV instead of the intelligence community.

GOP conflating past @NationalGuard deployments to the border with current use of active duty deployments to the border as if they are the same.
