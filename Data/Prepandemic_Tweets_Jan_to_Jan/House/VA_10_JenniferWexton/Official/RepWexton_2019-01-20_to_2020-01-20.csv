Today I spoke on the House floor in support of H.R. 5377 to eliminate the SALT cap &amp; help put money back in the pockets of 150000 households right here #VA10.  This is an unfair policy that punishes Virginia families—I'm proud the House voted to restore this tax relief today. https://t.co/3OqhqjtLic,2019-12-19 21:45:38,Twitter Web App,13,75
Today I introduced legislation that would establish a prize competition at @NSF to help spur greater innovation &amp; research into technologies that can detect deepfakes.

The facts are uncontested and the truth is inescapable—President Donald Trump abused his power and obstructed Congress.

.@RepMcEachin sent me this note as I decided whether to run for Congress.  I've reflected on Thomas Paine's words “These are the times that try men’s souls" frequently—but never more than today.

Ghost guns are self-assembled firearms which can be easily built from kits or 3D printed. They don't come with a serial number making them completely untraceable and extremely dangerous in the hands of bad actors.

Chief Acevedo is right. We need the Senate to pass #VAWA and close the boyfriend loophole preventing abusers from getting access to a firearm.

I spoke with @MacFarlaneNews today about my efforts to block funding for the relocation of @USDA’s research agencies.

I also stopped by @wegmeyerfarms in Hamilton to discuss their agritourism business.

@NWS @NOAA But this could be a major issue with the President's NOAA appointee Barry Myers.

The data from @NWS &amp; @NOAA is important to public safety &amp; costs each American taxpayer about as much as a cup of coffee.

El Paso. Tree of Life. Pulse. Charleston. Oak Creek.  Violent hate crimes have been on the rise.

During the shutdown a constituent wrote to me because her mortgage company denied her application while she was furloughed.  Because of her letter I wrote a bill that encourages banks and lenders to work with consumers during a shutdown.  Yesterday that bill passed the House. https://t.co/q4lBQinlru,2019-09-20 19:36:34,Twitter Media Studio,13,55

.@SecretaryCarson's remarks are revolting.  This only further confirms that his efforts to wipe out the Equal Access Rule are rooted in ignorance.

Close to 1 in 3 transgender individuals experience homelessness at some point in their lives—denying them access to shelter will put lives in danger.  These changes are cruel and don't reflect sound policy @SecretaryCarson must reinstate HUD's protections for LGBTQ individuals.,2019-09-19 18:34:36,Twitter for Android,85,312
Today @RepPressley and I wrote to @SecretaryCarson along with 59 of our colleagues to demand LGBTQ protections be reinstated in HUD's grant making process.

The most disturbing part of this video is that it's real for too many children in our country.

My heart is with the people of Odessa &amp; Midland in Texas this evening.  I've said this too many times before but we should not have to live in fear that we will be gunned down every time we leave our homes.    Enough. @senatemajldr must take action now. https://t.co/ilIQqb5pjr,2019-09-01 00:00:33,Twitter for iPhone,26,96
Elena is right: families like hers shouldn't have to become professional advocates and they shouldn't have to fight year after year for the basic right to quality affordable healthcare.

In Congress I’m proud that my bipartisan #EFFORTAct passed the House last month to expand research into addiction and has just been introduced in the Senate.

Brigadier General John Rose joined me in thanking our veterans this morning. Afterward my office held a "Blue Water Navy" resource fair to help local veterans with the claims filing process. I'm grateful to all of the organizations that came together to support #VA10's veterans. https://t.co/jdxsE1EmWr,2019-08-16 19:25:23,Twitter for iPhone,5,26
Today I presented veterans of the Vietnam War with @vietnamwar50th pins and thanked them for their service with a presidential proclamation ceremony.  Many Vietnam Veterans never received the welcome home they deserved—I was proud to welcome them home this morning. https://t.co/kZyYqaiaBX,2019-08-16 19:25:18,Twitter for iPhone,8,34
Congrats @LoudounSouthLL—a no-hitter and we're moving on to the next round! ⚾️ #LLWS https://t.co/1NDjPLqAkf,2019-08-16 18:21:27,Twitter for iPhone,3,11
I was very impressed by my visit to @BCRforHeroes this morning. They provide post-traumatic growth services so our veterans can thrive when they return home—and they’re seeing incredible success.  The veterans of #VA10 are lucky to have Boulder Crest in our community. https://t.co/uX0gIEfx8a,2019-08-16 16:27:02,Twitter for Android,5,18
Good luck to the @LoudounSouthLL team in their first game at the @LittleLeague World Series this morning.  #VA10 is rooting for you! https://t.co/Ix5jkPqFMP,2019-08-16 13:43:56,Twitter for Android,1,18
This is not about religious freedom—this is simply a license to discriminate for federal contractors being paid by the American taxpayer.   No one in this country should be fired from their job because of who they love or how they identify. https://t.co/qflL4Lnadj,2019-08-16 00:31:09,Twitter for iPhone,22,83
As a former guardian ad litem I know how vital it is to provide children in need with a safe and nurturing home.  All kids deserve the chance to grow thrive and dream—regardless of their circumstances.   Thank you to everyone at Evans Home for your work and perspective. https://t.co/HD6D8f8HsM,2019-08-15 22:15:54,Twitter for iPhone,5,22
The Henry &amp; William Evans Home for Children in Winchester is a refuge for kids that are abused homeless or otherwise in need.  Protecting our kids is important to me so I appreciated being able to hear from the staff at Evans Home today to better understand the work they do. https://t.co/YXvKWu5Rel,2019-08-15 22:15:52,Twitter for iPhone,5,35
There can’t be peace without dialogue.   This is a short-sighted decision by PM Netanyahu &amp; another example of President Trump’s desire to divide us for his own political gain.  We should be bringing people with different opinions together—not barring Congresswomen from visiting. https://t.co/SpIgTU2il2,2019-08-15 20:54:02,Twitter for iPhone,13,96
When I practiced law I prosecuted domestic abusers and helped connect survivors to the resources they needed. In these situations I saw firsthand how much survivors relied on places like the Laurel Center.  To everyone at the Laurel Center thank you for the work that you do. https://t.co/9hiWoLhiz0,2019-08-15 19:53:03,Twitter Web App,2,14
Today I toured the Laurel Center in Winchester. I proudly share their mission to end domestic and sexual violence.  It's critical that we support local agencies such as this that provide vital services like emergency housing and advocacy when survivors need it most. https://t.co/W2ridcX58j,2019-08-15 18:57:33,Twitter for iPhone,6,38
Wishing a full recovery to the officers injured in Philadelphia last night.  One witness who lived close by said the scene felt “like a war.”  Our cities are not war zones. We must keep these weapons out of dangerous hands and protect our police officers. https://t.co/W4OPc1sjGQ,2019-08-15 14:23:57,Twitter for iPhone,12,43
For 84 years #SocialSecurity has been the difference between financial security and financial ruin for millions of Americans. Today 2 in 5 seniors would live in poverty without this vital program.

Third stop—Oak Hart Farm!  I heard from Shawna about her mission to promote a culture of whole health rooted in family values and community involvement. That’s why Shawna &amp; her family work to provide their neighbors in #VA10 with sustainably grown food &amp; educational programs. https://t.co/I6hEcVcvUV,2019-08-14 21:37:31,Twitter for iPhone,4,17

I hosted a "Congressional Playdate Made Possible by the ACA" with the @LittleLobbyists children with complex medical needs and disabilities.  The ACA is a lifeline for these kids—and they deserve every opportunity to grow and thrive.

Today I visited the McLean Project for the Arts which does incredible work to uplift and bring art to the children and communities that otherwise wouldn’t have access. Thank you @MP4A for fostering a vibrant arts community in #VA10.  “Art is too important not to share.” https://t.co/ors60d701b,2019-08-13 21:41:31,Twitter for iPhone,0,19
In between stops I dropped in to say hello to David Yang the owner of Madison Deli. The deli was founded in 1995 by three sisters who immigrated to McLean from South Korea. Today the deli is still in the family and still serves excellent sandwiches and salads. https://t.co/f3dS9kQ7eT,2019-08-13 19:45:57,Twitter for iPhone,8,41
Thank you Lara for showing me around your beautiful bakery. Fluffy Thoughts Cakes has been serving delicious (and fluffy) confections since 2010.

Today I'm visiting constituents and small businesses in McLean and I couldn't swing through without grabbing lunch at the McLean Family Restaurant. Founded in 1969 and family owned MFR is an absolute staple in #VA10. Be sure to stop by for a meal that won't disappoint! https://t.co/hwQoNQ0aQC,2019-08-13 18:25:44,Twitter for iPhone,4,36
Good government means being open and accessible. I’ve held over 150 in-person meetings with constituents because it’s important to me that my staff or I can hear directly from you.

#VA10 is home to a robust &amp; diverse immigrant community—many of whom arrive on green cards. This administration is proposing more red tape &amp; barriers to make LEGAL immigration more difficult—especially for the communities of color that call Virginia home. https://t.co/Whfslejtj1,2019-08-13 13:58:49,Twitter for iPhone,17,46
This Friday I’ll be hosting a Vietnam Veterans Pinning Ceremony and resource fair for Blue Water Navy veterans.  I hope you’ll join me and our honored guest speaker Brigadier General John P.

The August recess helps me meet constituents exactly where they are. Today I visited Ashby Ponds for a townhall-style discussion on everything from gun violence to healthcare. It was a pleasure (as always) and the residents are some of the most informed and engaged in #VA10! https://t.co/aR5J4upiaJ,2019-08-12 19:15:13,Twitter for iPhone,7,47

Two years ago white supremacists descended on our Commonwealth for a violent rally in Charlottesville.  Today we honor the memories of Heather Heyer Trooper-Pilot Berke Bates and Lt. Jay Cullen.

Director Mulvaney's gleeful celebration of federal workers losing their jobs is as low as it gets. But it also confirms what we've known all along—this relocation has just been pretext for the administration to wipe out our civil service and to stifle objective research &amp; facts. https://t.co/nkv57MM3VB,2019-08-11 19:31:00,Twitter for iPhone,68,164
Thank you to the @ADAMSCenter_ for allowing me to join you for today's Eid service in Chantilly.   Eid Mubarak to all those celebrating in #VA10 and around the world!  #EidAdhaMubarak https://t.co/1yCyR9z7yg,2019-08-11 17:15:25,Twitter for iPhone,12,48

Is @realDonaldTrump going to listen to the @NRA or the over 90% of Americans that want universal background checks and safer communities?  Stop slow-walking this.

For kids with complex medical needs and disabilities the Affordable Care Act is literally a lifeline. Without it the cost of their care is impossible to afford—if their insurance would cover them at all.  This is why I’m fighting to #ProtectOurCare. https://t.co/bJuWXF0Lly,2019-08-09 22:58:07,Twitter for iPhone,135,305
Today I hosted a “Congressional Playdate Made Possible by the ACA” with the @LittleLobbyists where the kids played in an accessibility-friendly park while the moms talked healthcare policy with me.

I also had the opportunity to tour the Women Veterans Health Pavilion. Women veterans are the fastest growing population of veterans. This is an impressive facility—I’m pleased to see that women vets in #VA10 have a place to meet their healthcare needs. https://t.co/BOZYNNX4Bn,2019-08-09 18:07:44,Twitter for Android,7,24

Today marks the final day of #WorldBreastfeedingWeek.  The freedom to breastfeed is important for a baby's health and it empowers women to raise their kids how they know best.

I'm calling on @senatemajldr to bring back the Senate and vote on universal background checks.    We demand more than thoughts and prayers.    For #Gilroy. For #ElPaso. For #Dayton.

Today agritourism is hugely important to West Oaks and they run a thriving CSA program which provides local produce to families in #VA10. https://t.co/mEdYekiaxc,2019-08-02 20:16:26,Twitter for iPhone,2,20
Next stop the Homestead Farm at Fruit Hill Orchard! Katherine and Emily are a mother-daughter duo who opened up to provide our community with healthy homegrown produce.

First stop of the day—John &amp; Heather showed me around their family farm Marker-Miller Orchards founded in 1908 where they primarily planted apple orchards.

In the state Senate I voted to expand Medicaid—now there are an estimated 19000 #VA10 residents with access to healthcare.  Here in Congress I'm continuing that fight to bring healthcare to every family in Virginia. https://t.co/dSqpzkyKCJ,2019-08-01 22:03:38,Twitter for iPhone,5,24
Last year @LCPSOfficial's PowerFuel Summer Food Program served 49000 meals at 22 sites including here at the Sterling Public Library.  Every child deserves a healthy meal—no matter their income.

The Russians attacked our elections in 2016—and they’re still doing it.

A bipartisan majority of the House &amp; Senate voted to block arms sales to Saudi Arabia but the President just vetoed those bills.   Yemeni civilians deserve better.

The Trump admin is fighting to strip healthcare away from millions of Americans trying to take us back to a time when insurance companies charged as much as they could &amp; covered as little as they wanted.

Republicans in Richmond are so beholden to the gun lobby that they aren’t even willing to have a discussion about ways we can prevent gun violence.

I represent tens of thousands of federal employees who go to work every day without violating the Hatch Act.  If any one of my constituents behaved like @KellyannePolls they'd be out of a job.

And let me put it plainly: housing trans women in shelter consistent with their gender identity does NOT put other women at risk.

I had a great time sitting down with these Scouts to talk about public service.

Great food great conversation and even better company. https://t.co/Yfv1pCARVN,2019-05-28 23:52:38,Twitter for iPhone,4,23
This is the right decision by the Supreme Court—hard-won policies that protect transgender students should not be overturned.  Today's decision is an important victory for transgender students everywhere in America.  https://t.co/sCLD983pKl,2019-05-28 21:48:16,Twitter Web Client,22,74
Glad I could visit @ForestGroveES to learn about Dr. Becky Domokos-Bays' award-winning nutrition program.   @LCPSCafe is providing students in #VA10 with fresh nutritious meals at school and it makes a real difference for our kids.

BREAKING: I presided over the House floor to pass a desperately needed $19 billion disaster relief bill.   But the Freedom Caucus blocked this bipartisan bill once more because of shameless grandstanding.  Our fellow Americans are in need and this can’t wait.

Today is a special day in our household. Not only is it my birthday but—more important—it’s Andrew’s and my wedding anniversary!   Thanks for all you do for me the boys and the girls.

Today I attended Clarke County's Memorial Day Service "Women in the Military"—organized by the @AmericanLegion Post 41 &amp; @VFWPost9760 to commemorate the women who have served.

Nobody should be turned away from care because of who they are.   But that's exactly what this new rule will do.

Secretary Ben Carson is trying to rollback protections for transgender people seeking access to shelter and housing.   This puts lives at risk.   Carson lied to me &amp; the American people while giving Congressional testimony.

This is one of the best parts of the job: When a WWII veteran would look across the street each day to see a tattered American flag my office was able to team up with @amvetshq to provide a brand new American flag—flown over the US Capitol—for a special flag raising ceremony. 🇺🇸 https://t.co/lvxmYXtmyE,2019-05-23 21:19:26,Twitter Media Studio,12,51
As a former prosecutor I take Congressional testimony very seriously.   This week Secretary Carson lied to me and to Congress.   He lied again when he called me to “clarify” his testimony.   He’s proven himself to be deceitful &amp; inept as HUD Secretary.  He should resign. https://t.co/nM3hDf6rx6,2019-05-23 17:31:59,Twitter for iPhone,457,1168

Today the House voted to pass the #ConsumersFirst Act.   This bill will undo the Trump administration's sabotage of the @CFPB an important nonpartisan &amp; independent regulator that protects consumers from abusive practices.

One day after @SecretaryCarson told me he isn't anticipating any changes to protections for LGBTQ people in shelters HUD announced a proposal to gut that very rule.   He either lied to Congress or has no idea what policies his agency is pursuing. Either way it’s unacceptable. https://t.co/zn99sEKvth,2019-05-22 19:13:12,Twitter Web Client,5624,11472

This morning I reminded @stevenmnuchin1 that Congress is a coequal branch of government:  "You understand that we’re the legislative branch so we make decisions about legislating"  "You’re the executive branch which executes the laws—you don't make the laws we make the laws." https://t.co/uH54UR65BV,2019-05-22 13:47:51,Twitter Media Studio,72,254

100 years ago today the U.S. House of Representatives took a historic vote to pass the #19thAmendment and give women the right to vote.  Today there are over 100 women proudly serving in Congress.

Moreover @HUDgov removed critical resources for HUD-funded emergency shelters on how best to serve transgender individuals (who they are obligated to protect).   This matters especially when—according to @TransEquality—one in five transgender people experience homelessness.,2019-05-21 20:44:00,Twitter Web Client,11,41
The Equal Access Rule aims to ensure that @HUDgov’s programs are available to all eligible individuals regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity.   @SecretaryCarson's decision to remove LGBTQ nondiscrimination guidance is wrong and even he struggles to defend it. https://t.co/f3KdhJxQb5,2019-05-21 20:42:13,Twitter Media Studio,46,143
Building transportation resilience to prepare for the impacts of climate is critical.

Federal employees worked long hours with no pay for 35 days. Now I've received reports from constituents about delayed back pay and other issues with payroll. That's why I issued a letter alongside my colleagues @RepCummings and @GerryConnolly to get to the bottom of this. https://t.co/nvvJnhs63X,2019-02-13 14:31:03,Twitter Web Client,29,64

Proud to participate in a roundtable in support of the #FAMILYAct because I believe you shouldn’t have to choose between putting food on the table &amp; missing your baby’s first smile. #PaidLeave is good for our families and good for our economy. https://t.co/REWsQWBvcj,2019-02-12 22:48:54,Twitter for iPhone,7,31
Thank you @SOlympicsVA for stopping by my office this afternoon!  I loved hearing about the incredible impacts your programs are having here in Virginia. #SOHillDay https://t.co/72GUXYRe9r,2019-02-12 21:41:37,Twitter for Android,5,31
We need to make #paidleave accessible for every American family including Bret and Chad. Congress must pass the #FAMILYAct so that no worker in this country must choose between their job and their newborn child. https://t.co/JWljGdw3NW,2019-02-12 20:07:38,Twitter for Android,15,46
#Paidleave is the freedom to start a family.  #Paidleave is equality for women in the workplace.  #Paidleave is prioritizing workers over profits.  #Paidleave is long overdue in our country &amp; is supported by a vast majority of Americans.  It's time to pass the #FAMILYAct.,2019-02-12 19:39:59,Twitter for Android,70,266
In our Commonwealth 55% of working Virginians do not have access to paid leave programs.  The #FAMILYAct would provide workers with up to 12 weeks partial income when they need to take a leave for their health their child’s birth caring for a loved one and more. https://t.co/DQckWCpspd,2019-02-12 19:15:09,Twitter for Android,14,26
This is not good enough.  At the federal level when we pass common sense gun safety legislation we're saving lives.

I presented my first resolution on the floor today. The resolution said shutdowns harm our country and should not be used as a tool to resolve policy disagreements.

NEWS: I'm sending a letter along with 25 of my colleagues to @senatemajldr urging him to find the courage to vote to reopen the government.  We're sharing dozens of stories from our constituents who are hurting because of the #TrumpShutdown.  #ShutdownStories https://t.co/oiNz519eau,2019-01-22 19:45:51,Twitter for Android,136,332
President Trump's transgender ban – and it is a ban no matter how they try and spin it – undermines the values that this country was founded on.

I celebrated #MLKDay2019 with the @NAACP_Loudoun at the 27th annual Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. March and Celebration in Leesburg. Frigid temps didn’t stop us from walking singing and reminding ourselves that we can achieve justice and equality if we work together. #VA10 https://t.co/Paizlba4iW,2019-01-21 17:42:58,Twitter for iPhone,12,50
I’m disgusted by the repeated distribution of KKK literature in my hometown ahead of MLK day. Hate has no home here in Leesburg and we will not be intimidated by these tactics.   Please contact @LeesburgPolice or @LoudounSheriff if you find these fliers. https://t.co/ESIbHAItdp,2019-01-20 18:22:23,Twitter for iPhone,23,73
I visited the @ADAMSCenter_ on Friday for a forum about human rights violations against the Uyghurs and other religious minority populations in China.  We discussed legislation I’ve cosponsored in Congress and how to effectively communicate with their representatives. #VA10 https://t.co/4Qr8IJzBJN,2019-01-20 15:27:02,Twitter for iPhone,18,54
