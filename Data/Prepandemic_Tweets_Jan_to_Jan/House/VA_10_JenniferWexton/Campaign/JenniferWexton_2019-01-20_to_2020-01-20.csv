Inspiring to see so many fired up friends and neighbors at the Winchester #WomensMarch today.  In 2018 we took back the House.  In 2019 we flipped the General Assembly.  And in 2020 we WILL beat Donald Trump.   #VA10 is energized and ready to win! ✊📋  #WomensMarch2020 https://t.co/8OFUipmE35,2020-01-18 20:06:59,Twitter for iPhone,32,183
Maybe for once @realDonaldTrump you could stop the dangerous fearmongering especially in light of recent credible threats of violence.  Law enforcement already has its hands full &amp; this doesn’t help.  By the way—I thought you supported stronger background checks Mr. President? https://t.co/iJ6GQ3QQqc,2020-01-18 15:53:58,Twitter for iPhone,208,952
The President is lying and it demands a response.  Trump is actively supporting a lawsuit to strike down the Affordable Care Act—which would eliminate protections for preexisting conditions.  Make sure your friends and neighbors understand what's at stake here. https://t.co/81iGLIvQeA,2020-01-13 14:59:09,Twitter for iPhone,96,237

This time last year I was meeting with @GabbyGiffords to talk about how we need to flip #VA10.

Thank you @SenGillibrand for your voice in this primary—you are a powerful fighter for women and children in this country.  I know you'll continue to fight for progress just like you did last year for me here in #VA10—to ensure we take back the Presidency and the Senate in 2020. https://t.co/8WFx6EQe8K,2019-08-28 23:06:35,Twitter for Android,20,147

I joined dozens of volunteers today for a canvass launch in Algonkian.

Hey @VA_GOP — we already know how to make Virginia safer and it’s not by doing the NRA’s bidding.  Virginians if you’re ready for meaningful action on gun safety then knock doors donate and vote for @vademocrats this November so we can flip the General Assembly! #ExpectUs https://t.co/fshZZfI1bK,2019-08-19 23:06:11,Twitter for Android,52,158

No Virginian should have to fear that they will be fired from their job because of who they love or how they identify.  Politicians like Del. LaRock are standing in the way of equality and justice.

Gun safety advocates are showing up at the polls.   I ran unapologetically on gun safety and WON—so did @lucymcbath @JasonCrowCO6 and so many more in our Gun Sense Majority.

BREAKING: It's official – another Republican has just announced in #VA10 for 2020.

The President showed us who he is when he called Mexicans rapists and criminals.   He showed us again when he called them “shithole countries.”  And he’s showing us today when targeting Congresswomen of color who — by the way — are Americans.

On the campaign trail I used to say #ChangeIsComing. Now I can say that change is here. https://t.co/1EQNbNz2dW,2019-02-27 22:34:23,Twitter for iPhone,15,82
I am extremely proud of the majority of the @LCPSOfficial School Board who voted this evening to add LGBT protections in its nondiscrimation policy.  To our LGBT students and staff — you are seen you are supported and you are now protected in our schools.,2019-02-27 03:10:26,Twitter for iPhone,83,623

I was so honored to help kick off @johnfoustva’s re-election campaign today! Northern Virginia Democrats owe a great deal to his leadership and public service and I look forward to his next term representing Dranesville on the Board of Supervisors! https://t.co/zoUwX1Br8j,2019-02-24 23:00:19,Twitter for iPhone,10,36
Here’s how we ratify the #ERA:  1. Organize - knock doors &amp; register voters 📋 2. Bring your friends to vote on Nov 5 🗳️ 3. Dems win back the VA House &amp; Senate 🌊 4. Democrats ratify the ERA ♀️  257 days until Election Day. Let’s win this Virginia! https://t.co/qhbNZTKMCB,2019-02-21 18:16:35,Twitter for iPhone,83,176

“We are the ones we’ve been waiting for. We are the change that we seek.” -@BarackObama.   Happy #PresidentsDay Mr. President! Thank you for bringing this nation hope and change (and donuts) 🇺🇸🍩 https://t.co/i45eEXQnMA,2019-02-18 19:36:31,Twitter for iPhone,109,632
Roses are red. Violets are blue. There is no place for racial gerrymandering if we hope to ensure a healthy functioning democracy. https://t.co/uSQaoQHyTJ,2019-02-14 21:22:50,Twitter for iPhone,63,299
Happy #ValentinesDay to my favorite Valentine Andrew! You are my rock and I couldn’t have done any of this without you. Love you! 😘 💞 https://t.co/WqVauhhKWU,2019-02-14 15:34:25,Twitter for iPhone,2,117
Well Mr. President when I talked with hundreds of federal workers during your last shutdown they were "not happy" about working without pay for over a month.  Federal workers are not bargaining chips. #NoMoreShutdowns https://t.co/9XR8NgfL4w,2019-02-12 18:25:05,Twitter for Android,37,143
The data shows that common sense gun safety laws do save lives. That's why I've made gun violence prevention my top priority in Congress and look forward to passing H.R. 8 to guarantee universal background checks for every gun purchase. #EnoughIsEnough https://t.co/k6aDGqdbOl,2019-02-12 15:40:24,Twitter for Android,34,144
My friend Delegate @JCarrollFoy was just nominated for the @emilyslist Gabrielle Giffords Rising Star Award.   Not only is she a member of the #JenniferCaucus she’s a strong champion for Virginia women and families!

Having served in the General Assembly for 5 sessions this picture makes my heart happy.   @MomsDemand has become a major force in Virginia! https://t.co/MIYYK788tP,2019-02-05 01:57:17,Twitter for iPhone,128,849
I talked to @ELLEmagazine about my fight to have Congress reject future shutdowns as ways to resolve policy disputes. We were sent here to do our jobs and work out our disagreements — we must do that without hurting federal workers and our economy. https://t.co/fEQKyEqgVk,2019-02-01 18:28:22,Twitter for Android,13,38
I promised during my campaign that I would fight for a pay raise for our federal workers and I delivered on that promise this week as the House passed legislation to give them a 2.6% raise! https://t.co/jUqY8daxrl,2019-02-01 17:19:42,Twitter for Android,29,194

Something I learned on the Hill today — a majority of House Republicans agree with @realDonaldTrump that shutdowns are good.  So much so that they blocked my resolution that simply said shutdowns are bad. https://t.co/KhrSKXsOBu,2019-01-31 00:30:17,Twitter for iPhone,127,416
I had a great time at @CCAN’s 14th annual Polar Plunge this morning! Grassroots advocacy helped us achieve a pro-environment majority in the House. I didn’t take the plunge this year but a huge thanks to the hundreds who jumped into the freezing Potomac River to raise awareness! https://t.co/Z7xyBPpGnP,2019-01-26 17:38:52,Twitter for iPhone,6,44
The GOP in the House of Delegates just killed the #ERA.  81% of Virginians support ratification but the GOP continues to vote against the people.   It’s beyond disappointing but there are elections in November.   If we can’t change their minds we need to change their seats. https://t.co/PHNiG76xGe,2019-01-22 14:57:21,Twitter for iPhone,237,534
