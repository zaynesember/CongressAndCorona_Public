@NorahODonnell @jeffglor @VP @VP says the shutdown wasn't a mistake. No - it was worse: 800000 Americans missed two paychecks thousands of contractors went unpaid and our economy took an $11 billion hit.

President @realDonaldTrump says he wants to “protect patients with pre-existing conditions” – while his administration leads a legal and political attack on ACA protections for pre-existing conditions.

President @realDonaldTrump says that immigration “is a moral issue.” He’s right – and it’s a moral crisis of his own making.
