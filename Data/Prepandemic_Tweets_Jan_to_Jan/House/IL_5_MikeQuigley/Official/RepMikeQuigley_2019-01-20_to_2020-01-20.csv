An Ambassador appointed by the President just testified that the White House is blocking accessing documents that are important to this investigation.  Let's say it again: if there were evidence that would absolve the President the White House would be beating down our door. https://t.co/y2VwkvAUau,2019-11-20 14:46:39,Twitter Media Studio,843,1922

As a life-long fan of hockey I am thrilled that Coach Henderson is being inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. His selection is an outstanding achievement that honors a lifetime of dedication to sharing hockey with his community. https://t.co/pt561t69W4,2019-09-09 18:52:19,Twitter Web App,1,8
This would be laughable if it wasn’t so offensive. The Trump Department of Justice has lost the plot. They’re acting as a political attack dog for the President at the expense of clean air and public health. https://t.co/Gg91R1dtgG,2019-09-06 21:17:19,Twitter for iPhone,13,33
This week I've seen both the beauty of #Yellowstone and the devastating impact of human activity. That's why I'm introducing the Reducing Waste in National Parks Act to allow NPS to ban the sale of single-use plastic bottles whenever appropriate. #PlasticFree #SEECInYellowstone,2019-09-06 19:03:00,TweetDeck,12,65
As citizens of this beautiful planet we all have a responsibility to do our part to protect it. Even the smallest action like reducing use of single-use plastic water bottles is one way we can each #ActOnClimate. #SEECinYellowstone https://t.co/BgtmATgO7f,2019-09-05 22:08:51,Twitter for iPhone,2,16
Next on our agenda was a stop at Grand Canyon of Yellowstone. I’ll let the pictures speak for themselves. #SEECinYellowstone https://t.co/nim496fIfS,2019-09-05 22:05:51,Twitter for iPhone,2,22
Forests like this one can take over a century to recover from a wildfire. #Climatechange is leading to hotter drier conditions which means longer and more intense fire seasons. #SEECinYellowstone https://t.co/RTSPKu2g25,2019-09-05 21:49:35,Twitter for iPhone,3,5
The experts responsible for managing @YellowstoneNPS’s wildfires told us about the history fighting fires at Yellowstone. #SEECinYellowstone https://t.co/xgsdkYkSTQ,2019-09-05 21:41:41,Twitter for iPhone,1,4
During a visit to one of @YellowstoneNPS’s climate monitoring stations we heard from scientists about the importance of not focusing on just one species when we talk about climate change. Even one small climate change impact will impact the entire ecosystem. #SEECinYellowstone https://t.co/5yMnc6uGhn,2019-09-05 21:40:43,Twitter for iPhone,1,8
Here are @RepDebHaaland and @RepKClark checking out a sample of one of the beetles being studied in @YellowstoneNPS. #SEECinYellowstone https://t.co/DVuF9nZsWl,2019-09-05 20:24:39,Twitter for iPhone,0,5
We also met three citizen scientists who are helping on this project! Together with the 34 other volunteers on the project they will contribute the same work hours in a year as two full-time @NatlParkService employees! #SEECinYellowstone https://t.co/3E7twl6WYe,2019-09-05 19:20:50,Twitter for iPhone,0,7
There are scientists at @YellowstoneNPS who study the impact of climate change on the smallest animals in the park: bugs! Because their lifespans are shorter we can see the effects of #climatechange on them more quickly than on larger animals. #SEECinYellowstone https://t.co/dyF8VKd5Jd,2019-09-05 19:18:36,Twitter for iPhone,0,7
Early in our day we got stuck in a bison traffic jam! Today there are 4700 bison in @YellowstoneNPS up from 25 at their lowest point almost a century ago. #SEECinYellowstone https://t.co/bKV9zmImVD,2019-09-05 18:56:58,Twitter for iPhone,4,13
Shorter warmer winters➡️ Less winter die off ⤵️ Less carrion for scavengers⤵️ Depending more on wolves and cougars for kills that supply scavengers.  Climate change has a ripple effect! #SEECinYellowstone https://t.co/0nX9iwhC0a,2019-09-05 18:46:37,Twitter for iPhone,4,13
Did you know? Thanks to evolving conservation strategies @YellowstoneNPS has never been more pristine than it is today. But #climatechange threatens the careful balance of the food cycle. #SEECinYellowstone https://t.co/xvIk5iELF8,2019-09-05 15:43:29,Twitter for iPhone,3,7
We met up with some wolf experts who helped us spot an adult male moving through @YellowstoneNPS. https://t.co/ojlprW25wN,2019-09-05 15:41:24,Twitter for iPhone,1,5
Ready for day 2 of #SEECInYellowstone? Today we’ll visit Lamar Valley Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone and more! Have questions about what we’re learning? Tweet at us using #SEECInYellowstone.,2019-09-05 13:42:06,Twitter for iPhone,7,21
Thank you to the incredible @YellowstoneNPS staff who led us throughout our day in the park! #SEECinYellowstone https://t.co/cSJLe1eyZL,2019-09-05 02:25:18,Twitter for iPhone,3,9
Of course no visit to @YellowstoneNPS would be complete without seeing #OldFaithful’s iconic eruption! #SEECinYellowstone https://t.co/fcCfD4MWq0,2019-09-05 01:42:43,Twitter for iPhone,6,21
One unexpected impact of climate change is the lengthening tourist season. Shorter warmer winters mean tourists visit #Yellowstone sooner in the year and later into winter. That increase means more stress on @NatlParkService staff and on the park’s ecosystem. #SEECinYellowstone https://t.co/HnDBlfXM28,2019-09-04 22:37:35,Twitter for iPhone,7,15
The Norris Geyser Basin is one of the most popular destinations in #Yellowstone and one of its hottest! #SEECinYellowstone https://t.co/0gPEhUcrae,2019-09-04 22:28:52,Twitter for iPhone,3,8
In turn the trout are a food source that iconic animals like bears otters and bald eagles depend on. So you can see that one climate change impact has a ripple effect on the park’s ecosystem. #SEECinYellowstone,2019-09-04 22:01:02,Twitter for iPhone,2,8
Our first stop was to  learn about efforts to restore the native fish in #Yellowstone. Many fish like the cut throat trout depend on the colder water temperatures that climate change is slowly eliminating. #SEECinYellowstone https://t.co/bOVb6s3ju5,2019-09-04 19:55:58,Twitter for iPhone,8,14
We’re about to set out on our #climatechange tour! We’ll be posting on Facebook Twitter and Instagram throughout the day using #SEECinYellowstone https://t.co/fzrGeDE4Ql,2019-09-04 14:30:00,Twitter for iPhone,9,25
Today is the first full day of my tour of @YellowstoneNPS with my @SEEC colleagues. On the agenda is the Gibbon River Norris Geyser Basin Old Faithful and Yellowstone Lake! Follow along using #SEECInYellowstone.,2019-09-04 13:57:56,Twitter for iPhone,5,49
Our first wildlife encounter in #Yellowstone! Yellowstone is home to 10000–20000 elk during the summer and less than 4000 during the winter. #SEECinYellowstone https://t.co/YwSZoLGKvl,2019-09-04 01:23:46,Twitter for iPhone,3,18
If business as usual continues we’ll see an increase of 3-7 degrees globally over the next 90 years.  That means less snowpack increased fire risks thriving invasive species and harmful pests living longer. #SEECinYellowstone #YellowstoneClimateCrisis,2019-09-04 00:41:52,Twitter for iPhone,4,15
What happens in Yellowstone impacts many other parts of the country. Increasing temperatures means decreasing snowpack which means less water released downstream or water released more quickly earlier in the season. #SEECinYellowstone #YellowstoneClimateCrisis,2019-09-03 23:57:34,Twitter for iPhone,8,24
Did you know? If you’re younger than 33 you’ve NEVER experienced a month where the global temperature is below the 20th century average. #ClimateChangeIsReal #SEECinYellowstone,2019-09-03 23:24:07,Twitter for iPhone,10,23

Further stigmatizing mental illness is NOT the answer. If we want real answers about the gun violence epidemic the CDC should study the issue and we should pass my legislation to study the link between domestic violence and mass shootings. https://t.co/qiBShfaNO0,2019-08-22 22:03:40,TweetDeck,7,40

It’s disappointing but not surprising that all it took was one phone call from the NRA for the President to change his mind about background checks.

Congress took action today so that survivors will have access to better services that tribes will be able to better protect Native women and that stalkers and abusers won't be able to obtain dangerous weapons.

There is evidence that survivors of domestic violence are more likely to develop substance use disorders but there's never been a comprehensive review.
