There's a lot we can do but @senatemajldr and several Senators who think like him lack the moral courage to act and protect our communities. This is a dereliction of duty. Americans deserve a Congress that takes action on gun violence. 10/10  https://t.co/QfT7Cyxv76,2019-08-20 16:34:24,Twitter Web App,0,0
The scale of gun violence in our country is staggering.  39773 people are gunned down in our communities every year.  The CDC and public health researchers should get federal research funds &amp; treat it like the public health emergency it is. The NRA has opposed that. 9/10,2019-08-20 16:34:24,Twitter Web App,0,1
We should ban bump stocks and other modifiers that allow someone to convert a legal weapon into an illegal one. Even President Trump is on board with this one—we should make his executive order permanent law. There are a few bills out there I introduced a bipartisan one. 8/10,2019-08-20 16:34:24,Twitter Web App,0,2
Congress must also pass an assault weapons ban.  I carried an assault rifle in Iraq. It literally saved my life. But there's no place in America where a weapon of war should be on our streets. 7/10,2019-08-20 16:34:23,Twitter Web App,0,2
We should ban high-capacity magazines. Because if you can't hit what you're aiming for with 10 rounds you certainly aren't trained well enough to use a gun. 6/10,2019-08-20 16:34:23,Twitter Web App,0,4
We should create federal extreme risk protection orders—also known as a red flag law.  That's pretty straight forward—it says if a family member has concerns about the mental health of a loved one who owns a gun they can report it and have the guns secured by the police. 5/10,2019-08-20 16:34:23,Twitter Web App,0,2
There's also H.R. 1112—which gives law enforcement more time to do background checks. It's been sitting on the Senate calendar since March 5. Currently if someone buys a gun and a background check isn't processed in 3 days the buyer can pickup the gun 4/10,2019-08-20 16:34:23,Twitter Web App,0,1
There's a pile of House-passed bills the Senate should take up. Like H.R. 8—legislation that we passed in February. This bill would expand background checks to close loopholes that let people buy guns without a background check at gun shows or through unlicensed dealers. 3/10,2019-08-20 16:34:22,Twitter Web App,0,1

Low yield nuclear weapons... 1) make our enemies more likely to miscalculate and use nuclear weapons 2) dangerously lower the threshold for when nukes may be used 3) waste taxpayer money unnecessarily.

The president has a track record of pulling out of treaties with no alternatives—just look at Iran. If he takes America out of the New START treaty with no strategy Russia gets green light to increase their nuclear arsenal.
