The president can't use U.S. aid as a weapon to serve his own political purposes. But now that his team has all but admitted he did Congress can't be afraid to hold him accountable. This is an impeachable offense if true.,2019-09-20 15:43:07,Twitter Web App,209,977

Brett Kavanaugh is a liar who has a history of not respecting women. We can’t expect him to uphold the integrity of our country because he doesn’t have any of his own.
