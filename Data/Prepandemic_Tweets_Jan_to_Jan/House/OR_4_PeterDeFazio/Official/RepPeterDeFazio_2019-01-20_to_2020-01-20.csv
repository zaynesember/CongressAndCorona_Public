Thanks to @LWVLaneCo for the opportunity to speak on the need to protect the #ACA expand access to healthcare and reduce Rx drug costs. Far too many Oregonians are facing skyrocketing costs and something needs to change. https://t.co/voakMlU8Ok,2019-04-23 22:08:53,Twitter Web Client,3,10
Yesterday Social Security trustees reported the program will not be able to pay full benefits starting in 2035. My legislation ensures the nation’s wealthiest pay their fair share into the program and guarantees solvency for decades to come. https://t.co/gHV1c2jkiX,2019-04-23 20:41:36,Twitter Web Client,6,39
Thanks to @city_eugene for the opportunity to speak to your members last week about our nation's crumbling infrastructure and the need for a comprehensive 21st-century transportation bill.

Even in the Oregon spring rain it was a thrill to see construction underway at @swocc’s Science &amp; Tech Building. I’m pleased that I was able to help clear up some of the red tape to get this project moving to double the number of R.N. graduates we need to serve the South Coast! https://t.co/nESXjXtizd,2019-04-15 23:36:02,Twitter for iPhone,2,15
133 million Americans with pre-existing conditions including 312000 in OR-04 risk losing their coverage if the ACA were repealed. But Trump keeps threatening to replace it with his ‘secret plan’. This administration needs to recognize that the ACA is here to stay. https://t.co/1y7CH9AXIE,2019-04-10 21:21:26,Twitter Web Client,10,54
Thank you to Port of Bandon Commissioner Rick Goche for coming to DC to testify on the urgent need for investment in our nation's ports.

I'm so proud to have worked with my colleagues to put an end to the @USDA's wasteful cruel and unnecessary taxpayer-funded kitten testing. No more #kittens or #cats will be harmed by the USDA! https://t.co/5peMGu5qyP,2019-04-03 15:28:26,Twitter Web Client,22,67
Women are losing $900 billion every year because of paycheck discrimination.  Imagine how different our economy would look if everyone earned a fair wage! Same job same pay—it’s as simple as that. #EqualPayDay,2019-04-02 21:33:22,Twitter Web Client,10,52
And of course I’ll also be rooting on the @BeaverWBB—I just left my orange gear at home! #gobeavs,2019-03-28 23:11:30,Twitter for iPhone,0,14

This week President Trump put the full weight of his administration behind the *total* repeal of the Affordable Care Act—which would leave 21 million Americans including 450k in Oregon w/o healthcare. I'm going keep fighting against these outrageous efforts to gut the ACA. https://t.co/PdWkH1hCoD,2019-03-28 21:41:27,Twitter for iPhone,19,102

The Trump administration's announcement that it supports the total invalidation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is appalling. I will continue to do everything I can to stop these cruel efforts to rip away Americans’ health care. https://t.co/MF0ZvlJ7iP,2019-03-26 22:01:23,Twitter Web Client,7,47
The president’s national emergency is an unconstitutional power grab to fulfill a campaign promise for a wall that will cost billions and do nothing to stop illegal immigration and drug smuggling. We need 21st century solutions for 21st century problems not medieval technology. https://t.co/sskjwyHMFs,2019-03-26 21:53:09,Twitter Web Client,10,63
The Mueller Report is finished and now it's time for the American people to know what's in it.

The Trump WH has released their National Drug Control Strategy — and it makes ZERO mention of a wall. Even Trump’s own @ONDCP knows that a border wall will do nothing to stop illegal drugs from entering the U.S. https://t.co/60px9zSBpP,2019-02-01 22:13:31,Twitter for iPhone,18,31
