Today I visited the largest refugee camp at our southern border where 3000 people are waiting for months on end for their asylum claims to be processed. I was horrified by what I saw. Congress must end these atrocities! #DemsAtTheBorder #DontLookAway https://t.co/vGl43adPZb,2020-01-18 00:17:24,Twitter Web App,1178,1614
Throughout my time in Congress I've been proud to march with women to stand with women and defend reproductive freedom. My 100% pro-choice rating and proven track record is why I'm the only Democrat in OR-04 endorsed by @PPact and @prochoiceoregon #RiseUp #WomensMarch2020 https://t.co/xEcJoqf5Cf,2020-01-17 19:41:31,Twitter Web App,9,20

Trump’s reckless and impulsive actions have put our troops in harm’s way. We must do everything we can to stop this march towards war. We cannot afford to become mired in another endless conflict in the Middle East. https://t.co/jsIhzAavqT,2020-01-08 03:12:10,Twitter for iPhone,3,5
I have been working to strengthen the War Powers Act for years in order to limit presidential authority to declare war without consulting Congress.

The invasion of Iraq by former President Bush was the worst foreign policy mistake in U.S. history. Congress must act to rein in President Trump and reassert its constitutionally-granted power to declare war. https://t.co/djTHUjDm3u,2020-01-06 19:27:32,Twitter Web App,3,7
The American people deserve to know the full scope of any potential conflict—including an exit strategy—before the U.S. considers another military campaign in the Middle East or anywhere else in the world. We don’t want another endless war.  https://t.co/tND7zNdFj2 https://t.co/yadhdOTe5j,2020-01-04 19:37:29,Twitter for iPhone,2,8

The @EugeneWeekly got it right. The NRCC started targeting my race in February. They’ll stop at nothing to try to flip this seat.
