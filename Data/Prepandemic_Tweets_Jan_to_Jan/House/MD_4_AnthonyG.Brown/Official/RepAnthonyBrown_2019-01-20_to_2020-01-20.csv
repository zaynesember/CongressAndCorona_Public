#VAWA provides invaluable resources to local communities and to law enforcement to combat the scourge of domestic violence.

The President's coziness toward Russia is outrageous. As I told @AriMelber last night Trump's own intel chiefs made clear to Congress that Russia's malign activities are a real threat to the U.S.  Why does the President cater to &amp; respect Putin more than his own intel officials? https://t.co/PhzS4zIG9u,2019-01-31 17:07:48,TweetDeck,88,189
The President consistently carries water for Russia’s malign actions around the globe and is cozier with Putin’s assessment of the world than he is with the assessment of our Intel Chiefs.  I’ll be talking about the President’s questionable actions soon on @TheBeatWithAri.,2019-01-30 23:02:02,Twitter for iPhone,39,127
This bill strengthens #SocialSecurity which has kept millions of seniors out of poverty. It's crucial we not only preserve the promise of a dignified retirement for all Americans but expand that promise for generations to come. Proud to join @RepJohnLarson on this. #Secure2100 https://t.co/uXSyouyZAE,2019-01-30 17:04:31,TweetDeck,22,41
Last year Trump cancelled federal employees' cost-of-living raise - fitting right in with his pattern of assault on the federal workforce.  The #TrumpShutdown showed federal workers still struggle to make ends meet. Giving them the pay they deserve is the right thing to do. https://t.co/tvfOfvfS1w,2019-01-30 15:17:47,TweetDeck,34,85
The impact of the #TrumpShutdown will be felt for weeks if not months by those federal workers and contractors who are most vulnerable. Shutdowns should never be employed as negotiating strategy and President Trump shouldn't shut down the government again. https://t.co/8pn6aofD2U,2019-01-29 20:39:48,TweetDeck,5,19
And now the administration is reportedly going to send thousands of troops back to the border for a dubious mission where they'll be doing routine tasks on behalf of CBP.   The President is using the military as his play-thing. The real crisis is in the Oval Office. https://t.co/Ar1hVrpzFq,2019-01-29 19:17:41,TweetDeck,78,362
To undermine our servicemembers their families and the DOD for a vanity project that is widely viewed by experts as ineffective is irresponsible. To deploy active duty and reserve soldiers to stand in place of that undertaking is reprehensible. @HASCDemocrats will get answers. https://t.co/Nm4JQAMaG3,2019-01-29 15:21:21,TweetDeck,6,17
.@mdhousedems' and @MDSenate's efforts to make sure essential employees can still support their families during a shutdown coupled with my bill to elevate these efforts on the federal level will prevent needless pain if the President shuts down the government on Feb. 15. https://t.co/8KPh8JqO1G,2019-01-28 22:50:25,TweetDeck,13,24
The #TrumpShutdown was 35 days of needless suffering for millions of Americans manufactured by President Trump.  I’ll be on Fox News to explain how we can avoid another #TrumpShutdown: the President should work with Congress on effective border security and immigration reform.,2019-01-27 17:53:24,Twitter for iPhone,15,70
We remember the Holocaust to ensure such horror never happens again and to remind ourselves that the elements that brought it about decades ago still exist today. Take this day to honor the victims and to pledge to fight hate wherever it arises.,2019-01-27 17:35:04,Twitter for iPhone,10,25

@SpeakerRyan Trump is already threatening another shutdown or to declare a national emergency. Neither is acceptable.   We are never going to give in to a hostage-taker never going to build his wall and are always going to stand up for federal workers contractors and our national security.,2019-01-25 19:58:44,TweetDeck,23,64
@SpeakerRyan Let's get another thing straight.  Trump caved. He listened to Democrats and agreed to open the government before negotiating.   This is a win but the damage to fed workers and contractors their families and our country is done. This was shameful and should never happen again.,2019-01-25 19:37:01,TweetDeck,141,460
@SpeakerRyan - Trump keeps the government shutdown for over 30 days - Trump threatens a national emergency - Trump proposes a sham deal - And now Trump agrees to a CR almost exactly the same as the one we wanted on December 20.  He made thousands of people suffer. For nothing. #TrumpShutdown,2019-01-25 19:28:14,TweetDeck,31,83
So let me get this straight.  - On Dec. 19 Senate passes a short-term CR funding the gov. until Feb. 8 - Trump demands $5 billion for a wall. - In his last act of cowardice @SpeakerRyan doesn't bring the Senate bill up and instead brings one up with wall money. - We shut down.,2019-01-25 19:27:34,TweetDeck,41,88
The #TrumpShutdown is a threat to the safety and security of all Americans.  We've sent 10 bills to the senate. We've sent bills that the Senate previously passed with unanimous support.  Bring the bills up. Open the government. @senatemajldr &amp; @realDonaldTrump: do your jobs. https://t.co/qr1Zac9pYd,2019-01-25 15:44:20,TweetDeck,51,119
The White House is desperate.  They:  -Shut down the government -Threatened a national emergency -Backed off of the national emergency threat -Proposed a sham 'compromise' -Deal fails in the Senate - And now back to declaring a national emergency?  Just. Open. The. Government. https://t.co/nDMPGRkSNP,2019-01-24 22:46:31,TweetDeck,30,64
The Trump administration has ordered more and more federal employees back to work without pay limiting their cash-flow and hurting them and their families.  My bill would let these workers get the same benefits as their furloughed counterparts. It's the common-sense thing to do. https://t.co/KKgMo6L14T,2019-01-24 22:02:02,TweetDeck,4,13
10 bills. We have sent 10 bills that would reopen the government to the Senate. That's 10 bills Sen. McConnell has refused to bring up for a vote. 10 missed opportunities to do the right thing.

We haven't done enough to tackle the epidemic of gun violence Americans experience on our streets in our movie theaters and at our schools.

Hey @SecretaryRoss why don't you come down to my town hall on Saturday and find out for yourself?

If Trump is going to continue to hold federal employees hostage then we will ensure they are provided for during his shutdown. It’s deeply disturbing the President is proud of the human suffering he has created and we will do everything we can to provide support and relief.,2019-01-24 15:11:24,TweetDeck,11,38

The #TrumpShutdown's impact on national security cannot be overstated.

8980 soldiers who are ready willing and beyond able to serve fight and die for their country.
