A decade after I landed in a C-130 in Iraq @PeteButtigieg stepped off a C-17 in Afghanistan. Pete understands America’s role in the world and is uniquely suited for this moment  Pete is the right person to take on and defeat Trump and lead us into a better future #TeamPete https://t.co/MDkB4ENvaD,2020-01-09 19:17:20,TweetDeck,488,1889
