Very confused by people not calling for Northam's resignation over his unrepentant support for infanticide this week. Neither his hypocritical racism nor infanticide are defensible. One however is state sanctioned murder. Apparently they're more tolerant of killing babies? 🤫,2019-02-02 04:23:18,Twitter for Android,40,166

Given the "committee" is comprised entirely of appropriations I submit that @realDonaldTrump can keep them focused by only signing a CR (2yr or 3wks at a time) until they help #SecureOurBorders.
