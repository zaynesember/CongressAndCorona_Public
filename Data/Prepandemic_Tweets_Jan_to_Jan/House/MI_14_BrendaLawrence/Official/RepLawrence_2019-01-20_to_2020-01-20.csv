The 35 days of chaos the American people endured for an ineffective wall is inexcusable. They deserve more than 3 weeks of job security and I look forward to working with my colleagues keeping the government open for the good of our nation and the people. https://t.co/EZcyPOELoy,2019-01-26 02:05:13,Twitter for iPhone,4,16
With every day that passes in this #TrumpShutdowm more and more Americans suffer. 800000 federal workers as of today missed 2 paychecks and now the safety of our airways and travelers fall victim. #EnoughIsEnough #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/iM1dC6ju3x,2019-01-25 19:03:30,Twitter for iPhone,0,5
This is no small matter. When it comes to protecting our nation and the American people we must have the HIGHEST standard for who is allowed access to our most sensitive secrets. We need answers. Now. @OversightDems https://t.co/MRDa9QlAsQ,2019-01-25 16:09:00,Twitter for iPhone,40,83

This is more than tone deaf this is a dangerous perspective from a leader who serves in the President’s cabinet. Billionaire @SecretaryRoss just doesn’t get it. #EndTheShutdown #TrumpShutdown https://t.co/uLGR5kLbOm,2019-01-24 18:58:21,Twitter for iPhone,3,2
The #TrumpShutdown is making us less secure not more. FBI agents can't pay their bills—and the shutdown is even endangering their ability to do their jobs track down criminals and keep us safe. It’s time to #EndTheShutdown! https://t.co/ZMF7O2DrBN,2019-01-23 22:46:24,Twitter for iPhone,13,22

This year as we reflect on the 46th anniversary of Roe v. Wade we know that it is our duty to #FightForRoe at all costs for reproductive rights because bodily autonomy = freedom.,2019-01-22 17:15:42,Twitter for iPhone,5,15
In a 5-4 vote the Supreme Court allows Trump’s transgender military ban to go into effect. After bravely serving their country this ban is not only insulting and discriminatory but also harmful to our national security.  https://t.co/hupfqSPdBD,2019-01-22 16:21:19,Twitter for iPhone,3,10
Remembering some of the great women behind a great man. “As the nation celebrates Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. it is also a time to remember the women who helped King propel the civil rights movement forward.” #MLKDay ⁦@HouseDemWomen⁩  https://t.co/p3BFUzyJG3,2019-01-21 20:50:04,Twitter for iPhone,9,28
So glad to join the Southfield #MLKDay program with State Rep. Kyra Harris Bolden State Sen. Jeremy Moss and Oakland County Treasurer Andy Meisner. Let’s all remember to take time today to honor Dr. King’s legacy and follow his example of servant leadership. #MLKDay2019 https://t.co/uQARKrOrjA,2019-01-21 20:42:36,Twitter for iPhone,4,27
Today our nation pauses to honor Civil Rights icon Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. While his life here was cut too short his legacy and his truth will always live on. Let us always remember his example to never be silent about things that matter. #MLKDay⁠ ⁠ https://t.co/k7lmB2NIng,2019-01-21 13:56:54,Twitter for iPhone,4,21
