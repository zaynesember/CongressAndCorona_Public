Lowcountry infrastructure plays an essential role in maintaining a strong economy and keeping our residents safe.

The most common issue Lowcountry residents bring up to me is the crushing cost of healthcare and prescription drugs. I have helped pass eight bills out of the House that lower these costs and expand access.

I was elected to serve you not myself. And I certainly wasn’t elected to give myself a raise. That's why I bucked both parties by helping to kill a proposed pay hike for Congress this year.

I know it’s a rare site to see Democrats and Republicans working together these days. But I promised to be different and break through that type of partisanship if I got to Congress.

Over two years ago I pledged to the people of the Lowcountry that if they elected me to Congress I would fight like hell to ban offshore drilling off our coast.  Today my bipartisan bill to do just that comes up for a vote in the US House of Representatives.  Let’s get it done.,2019-09-11 14:07:57,Twitter for iPad,200,1104

Great to see candidates for president supporting a ban on drilling. Folks from both parties understand that offshore drilling is bad for our environment and our economy.

No party is immune to redistricting abuse. Republicans do it in red states Democrats do it in blue states. That’s why both parties must come together to take the politics out of redistricting. Candidates should win on their ideas and merits not bc their party rigged the system.,2019-07-07 21:25:27,Twitter for iPhone,28,128
Overcoming gerrymandering isnt impossible just extremely rare. Our district was rigged for the GOP by 10 pts and it didnt flip for 40 yrs. When we won some called it the biggest upset in SC history. Not bc of the types of campaigns we ran but bc of how the district was drawn.,2019-07-07 21:25:27,Twitter for iPhone,15,98
Fewer general elections favor incumbents you know the folks drawing the lines. And when a district is rigged for one particular party the winner of the primary is usually the most conservative or liberal. That’s why we have very few moderate politicians anymore.,2019-07-07 21:25:26,Twitter for iPhone,10,28
They have the authority to cut deals with other legislators to make their districts “safer” so they are less likely to face a tough general election opponent. This results in very few competitive general elections and more competitive primaries.,2019-07-07 21:25:26,Twitter for iPhone,9,26
Every 10 yrs partisan politicians use the power of redistricting to draw district lines in a way that protects their own political interests. It’s time to take that power away and let independent commissions draw them in a more fair and equitable manner. https://t.co/UGy6NLk6OA,2019-07-07 21:25:25,Twitter for iPhone,131,287

Every day for the last 3 yrs Ive driven by Mother Emanuel on my way to work. Its a daily reminder of the unspeakable tragedy carried out by a racist monster who legally obtained a gun thru a loophole in the law. This week the House closes that loophole. https://t.co/9kgu8GKV9E,2019-02-26 13:26:24,TweetDeck,203,693

Enjoyed my trip to the state house today meeting w/ leaders from both parties about ways to move SC forward. I look forward to partnering with our state legislators to ban offshore drilling and bring back federal funding for critical infrastructure projects. #LowcountryOverParty https://t.co/CMIXqe0rqp,2019-02-19 22:42:02,Twitter for iPhone,62,310
The Lowcountry is blessed to be home to the Gullah Geechee community. We must do all we can to protect these families their properties and way of life. #SC01 https://t.co/MrloXd2eau,2019-02-19 00:49:40,Twitter for iPhone,135,489

Thank you to @Google for continuing their investment in South Carolina. I’m honored to have the Moncks Corner data center in my district where they are investing another $600 million which makes their SC investment $2.4 billion! #SC01,2019-02-16 01:07:45,Twitter for iPhone,41,410

Thanks for all you do Kathryn. Amanda and I understand all too well the outrageous cost of childcare these days. But too many parents have to choose between childcare and a career. We owe it to every American family to make affordable childcare a top priority in this country. https://t.co/kDj8jXRYoA,2019-02-11 01:54:02,Twitter for iPhone,120,512

Saddened by the news of the passing of @JohnDingell a legend and pioneer who paved the way for so many of us who now serve in Congress. My deepest sympathies and prayers go out to my colleague @RepDebDingell and the entire Dingell family.,2019-02-08 03:41:47,Twitter for iPhone,18,257
Welcome to Charleston @jonlovett @TVietor08 @jonfavs and the @PodSaveAmerica team. I’m sorry I can’t make it your show tonight but I’m up in DC for votes. However I did send you some of the finest craft beer in the Lowcountry to enjoy while you’re in town. Catch you next time! https://t.co/LpcaGDfqn2,2019-02-07 18:56:41,Twitter for iPhone,85,1975

I’ve had the pleasure of enjoying a Wednesday night or two at Awendaw Green’s Barn Jam. The Lowcountry is lucky to have Eddie White host this great event with awesome music every week up at the “North Pole” of #SC01!   https://t.co/peQkuL0rMn,2019-02-04 19:05:24,TweetDeck,18,100

Today was my first day in DC since the shutdown finally ended. On the plane this AM I made a new @Spotify playlist to listen to as I work to prevent another shutdown from happening. 🇺🇸  Take a listen 🎶 ⬇️    https://t.co/yLoibKiTOU,2019-01-29 02:24:10,Twitter for iPhone,52,227
Less than 12 hrs after arriving at this airport I’m dropping my wife off. She’s carrying donations and love to India. She has organized and is spearheading another trip for a nonprofit that helps kids rescued from child sex slavery.
