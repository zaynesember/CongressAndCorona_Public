When South Carolina rejected the 19th Amendment in 1920 Salley was disappointed but didn’t give up. She kept fighting for almost another half century!

Every single person who played a role in the fight against offshore drilling deserves a round of applause. But this fight is by no means over. We need legislation to permanently protect our coastal communities from the threat of offshore drilling. Congress must pass my bill.,2019-04-25 19:25:06,Twitter Web Client,51,206
And NOW Interior Secretary Bernhardt announced that - in part because of the ongoing litigation and clear opposition by elected officials - the Administration was indefinitely postponing their plans to expand offshore oil and gas drilling. This is great news!,2019-04-25 19:25:06,Twitter Web Client,75,230
Last month the courts got involved as well. A federal judge ruled that Trump did not have the authority to overturn a ban on offshore drilling in the Arctic and parts of the Atlantic.,2019-04-25 19:25:06,Twitter Web Client,20,68
We made it clear that opposition to offshore drilling was NOT a partisan issue. We all know that our coastlines are too valuable to our economy environment and way of life to jeopardize because when you drill you spill. And even a small oil spill would devastate our community.,2019-04-25 19:25:05,Twitter Web Client,17,69
On my 4th day in office I introduced a bill that would place a ten-year ban on oil and gas leasing. Last month I introduced a bill that would permanently ban oil and gas drilling on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts - both with bipartisan support.,2019-04-25 19:25:05,Twitter Web Client,14,78
The reaction from the Lowcountry and coastal communities across the country was immediate. While running for office I promised I would say hell no to offshore drilling. My opponent... not so much.,2019-04-25 19:25:05,Twitter Web Client,14,70
I just heard reports that the Trump Adminstration was halting its plans to expand offshore drilling in the Atlantic. How did we get here and what does this mean?

Proud to support H.R. 840. No veteran should be unable to seek the help they need because they lack access to child care. Healthcare should work for our veterans and not the other way around. #ChildCare4Vets https://t.co/ryD8pbq9hB,2019-02-08 16:10:19,Twitter for iPhone,30,121

I have real concerns about the nomination of David Bernhardt as Sec. of the Interior. My first priority is making sure our oceans are safe from dangerous and unwanted oil drilling. How will a former fossil fuel lobbyist be an adequate protector of our vital natural resources?,2019-02-05 01:28:53,Twitter for iPhone,549,1474

"Veterans have sacrificed so much for us and we want to give them the help they need to again become productive citizens.”  This is a great development.

I am relieved that the President has agreed to sign a 3-week C.R. to reopen the government and get federal workers including the U.S. Coast Guard paid. Now leadership of both parties need to negotiate a real permanent solution and make sure this never happens again.,2019-01-25 19:28:05,Twitter Web Client,32,305

Today we honor the life &amp; legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. During this time of major contention throughout our nation we should look at Dr. King as a guide.

I am glad to see the President express willingness to negotiate on real immigration reform. But we can’t bring both sides together to find a bipartisan solution that ensures border security and upholds our values while the govt is closed and American families are hurting.,2019-01-20 20:43:07,Twitter for iPhone,19,133
