Our kids deserve the best education in the world. I'm shocked at the hypocrisy from @BetsyDeVosED. Check out my op ed for @Newsweek: https://t.co/r6SH05CXYk,2019-05-08 22:01:39,Twitter Web Client,91,223

I ran on a promise to set a new standard of accessibility. In our first hundred days I've worked hard to make that promise a reality.  https://t.co/GeXXes6c0F,2019-04-25 00:30:00,TweetDeck,27,115

Sect. DeVos wants to cut every single dedicated literacy program. That's insane when 2/3 of kids can't read at grade level. https://t.co/wq0n1GfNPD,2019-04-11 20:37:03,Twitter Web Client,33,119
Insanely hypocritical. Sect. DeVos proposes cutting all literacy programs for kids but then really enjoys doing photo ops reading to them.  https://t.co/Zign6IYbzb,2019-04-10 23:25:01,Twitter Web Client,48,150

1 in 7 people in the Central Valley would lose their health insurance if the Administration repeals the Affordable Care Act. Not on my watch. https://t.co/kWKJFfhaXB,2019-03-29 16:00:01,TweetDeck,35,131

Presidential candidates looking to compete in California should realize there’s more to the state than San Francisco and Los Angeles. The tacos are great in the Central Valley folks! https://t.co/4OW9pZ8JVs,2019-03-27 21:54:57,Twitter for iPhone,66,322
I'll say it once again - pre-existing conditions must be covered. Every single person in our community has a right to healthcare. I'm ready to fight any attempts at repealing the ACA right alongside you all. https://t.co/44D91IyZTV,2019-03-27 20:00:01,TweetDeck,20,68
