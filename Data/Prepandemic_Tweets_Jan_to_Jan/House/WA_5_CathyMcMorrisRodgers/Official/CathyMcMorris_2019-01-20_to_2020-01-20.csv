Here are my 4 principles for #dataprivacy legislation that will promote innovation--- a better approach than the regulatory regime of #GDPR. https://t.co/0GqDVWa715 via @seattletimes,2019-06-18 14:22:28,Twitter Web Client,1,5
Another example why we shouldn’t let the EU dictate privacy regs for the rest of the world. #GDPR is increasing the market shares of companies like Google &amp; Facebook. They may be able to swallow #GDPR’s costs but small companies &amp; startups can’t. This will stifle innovation. https://t.co/HwU1kgEDvN,2019-06-18 14:22:28,Twitter Web Client,5,12
