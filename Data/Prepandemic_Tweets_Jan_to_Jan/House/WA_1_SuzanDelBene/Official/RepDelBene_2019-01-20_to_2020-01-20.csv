Americans have a right to data protection.

If Trump wants comprehensive immigration reform he needs to work with Congress. Declaring a national emergency to build his ill-conceived border wall is reckless undermines our rule of law and sets a dangerous precedent.,2019-02-15 23:43:27,Twitter for iPhone,6,31
