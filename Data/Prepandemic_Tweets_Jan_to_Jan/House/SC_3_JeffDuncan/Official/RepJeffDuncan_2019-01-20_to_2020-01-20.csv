Schiff &amp; the Democrats are running a sham impeachment investigation in secret keeping Members of Congress–&amp; the entire nation–in the dark.

Nancy Pelosi &amp; Democrats said they would negotiate when the government opened up. Well it’s been 7 days &amp; they are still unwilling to secure the border &amp; build the wall. They aren’t taking the safety &amp; security of the American people seriously.,2019-02-01 19:32:13,Twitter Web Client,28,102

I have been an advocate for association health plans &amp; free-market health care reforms for years as our nation has suffered under the disastrous &amp; broken Obamacare law.

I filed the Eliminating Foreign Intervention in Elections Act to cut federal funding from any state/municipality that allows noncitizens or illegal immigrants to vote. More &amp; more of these initiatives are popping up across the country so we must keep working to push this bill.,2019-01-28 15:35:40,Twitter Web Client,3,35

Too many liberal communities are beginning to allow noncitizens &amp; illegal immigrants the sacred right to vote in local elections as part of their open borders agenda. Today it’s local elections – next it could be state or nationwide elections.,2019-01-28 15:35:40,Twitter Web Client,7,36
Even though the House is now led by Nancy Pelosi &amp; open border Democrats I will never stop fighting to make our country safe for all Americans. This starts by ensuring federal dollars are restricted from jurisdictions that have no respect for our nation’s laws.,2019-01-28 14:43:57,Twitter Web Client,0,13
Sanctuary cities foster &amp; encourage illegal activity which poses a great danger to American citizens. Congress must do all it can to defund &amp; crack down on these jurisdictions that encourage illegal behavior &amp; my bill will do just that.,2019-01-28 14:43:57,Twitter Web Client,2,13

No Rep. Gabbard - they should be done by leaders actually sitting down TO negotiate. How about getting Speaker Pelosi (leader of Dems) to do this instead of bashing @POTUS for presenting proposal to public?  https://t.co/0uWWTU8hoe,2019-01-20 17:31:17,Twitter for iPhone,10,39
