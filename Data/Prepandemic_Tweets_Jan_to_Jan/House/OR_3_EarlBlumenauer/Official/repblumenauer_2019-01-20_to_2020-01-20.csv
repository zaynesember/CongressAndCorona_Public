Everyone should have access to health care no matter what.   I'm proud to be leading the effort for universal care with @RepJayapal and over 100 of our colleagues. The time is now. #MedicareForAll https://t.co/fPwumI5kQ4,2019-02-25 22:38:37,Twitter for iPhone,87,447
One-third of food produced in North America depends on pollination by bees and they alone account for $15 billion of the economy.   In order to maintain a healthy food supply bee-toxic insecticides have no place on our farms.

Gov’t should not interfere with decisions made between women their families and medical care providers. This gag order is a direct attack on 24000 Oregonians who can’t afford the rising costs of health care and rely on providers like @PPFA. #NoGagRule,2019-02-22 23:33:23,Twitter for iPhone,20,90
My bill with @RepMcGovern fixes this loophole. We need experts in charge of protecting the future of our pollinators not insiders from the industries they are supposed to regulate. #ProtectPollinators https://t.co/kwauLVbE9v,2019-02-22 21:26:42,Twitter for iPhone,19,57

If Trump can call a national emergency for a fake crisis at the border then surely Congress should call a national emergency for the very REAL crisis that is climate change.
