I believe our Founding Fathers knew what they were doing when they included the Second Amendment in our Constitution &amp; I will continue to fight against Democrats’ efforts to weaken it. I’ve said it before &amp; I’ll say it again: I value our #2A right &amp; I will always protect it.,2019-02-27 20:54:52,Twitter Web Client,0,1
I just voted against H.R. 8 because as a gun owner I believe in the importance of our constitutional right to keep &amp; bear arms. This lazy piece of legislation would not protect Americans from gun violence – it just creates more hoops for law-abiding citizens to jump through. https://t.co/B8K8OdKRki,2019-02-27 20:53:11,Twitter Web Client,2,5
