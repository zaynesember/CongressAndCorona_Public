Withholding #vaccines to migrant families is shortsighted and dangerous.  I visited border facilities in TX earlier this year - the conditions were ripe for a public health emergency.

@StateDept We must send a strong signal to our #diplomats that they are valued and that starts with retaining and promoting our best and brightest public servants. The #STANDAct does just that.,2019-10-30 19:26:24,Twitter Web App,3,9
@StateDept Career #diplomats dedicate their lives to serving the American people and government both home and abroad.

@StateDept Under this Administration a record # of Ambassador positions have been filled by political appointees.
