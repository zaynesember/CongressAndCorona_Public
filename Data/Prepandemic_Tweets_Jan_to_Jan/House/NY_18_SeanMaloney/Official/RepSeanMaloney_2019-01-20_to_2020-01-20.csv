The rule of law matters.  @senatemajldr can’t just let the President hide thousands of documents and block witness testimony because he's afraid of what they might reveal.  That's what we call a cover-up.,2020-01-18 00:09:00,TweetDeck,579,2309

From day one Trump's been hellbent on destroying SNAP. This time he’s trying to take food off the table of nearly 700000 Americans - right in time for the holidays...

I have a high bar for impeachment but Trump has left us with no alternative.  He solicited foreign interference in our election. He obstructed lawful investigations. He lied to the public.

Yesterday I asked Dr. Fiona Hill if she felt Amb. Sondland was asking for something out of line in the Ward Room?

Dr. Fiona Hill &amp; David Holmes confirmed how Trump conditioned official acts on Ukraine's willingness to announce politically beneficial investigations. They testified at personal &amp; professional risk. I thank them for their courage &amp; dedication to the truth. #DefendOurDemocracy https://t.co/wWPw7c0jNF,2019-11-21 22:41:00,Twitter Media Studio,641,3408

FACT CHECK: The Mueller investigation netted dozens of indictments &amp; more than 6 convictions - including Roger Stone.  It exposed Russia's effort to help Trump win in '16 &amp; their intent to do so again in '20. It did NOT exonerate Trump.  How about telling the truth @Jim_Jordan? https://t.co/Zs9XSqsw6n,2019-11-21 20:47:41,Twitter Web App,5514,14598
Important clarification here from Dr. Hill: President Trump's Ukraine pressure campaign was a domestic political errand that clashed with U.S. foreign policy. The two things diverged and she was right: it ALL blew up. https://t.co/1V3oOx2MCb,2019-11-21 20:32:59,Twitter Web App,469,1378
Powerful reminder that these witnesses have come to Capitol Hill at great personal and professional risk. They do so because they feel a duty to this country and a duty to the truth.

Friendly reminder: we’re here on our THIRD try and there was a whole bunch of stuff Amb.

Just recapped the facts laid out in today's open hearings with @Lawrence @TheLastWord. It comes down to one thing - Trump abused his power as president of the most powerful country in the world to cheat in the 2020 election.

It all comes down to one thing - the president abused his power as the commander in chief of the most powerful country in the world to cheat in the 2020 election.

You know we’re in trouble when @LindseyGrahamSC is the guy in the room making the most sense - but honestly I completely agree here.   What Trump’s doing in Syria will forever be a stain on US credibility abroad. It’s shameful. https://t.co/TQBWUpinDl,2019-10-16 18:56:52,Twitter for iPhone,4,33

There’s a lot of moving pieces here and we’re going to get all the facts.

You can't have a whistleblower go to the boss and say “Can I tell the public the things you are doing wrong?” That is just not how it works. But when Maguire went to the White House and DOJ that's exactly what he did - he put the fox in charge of the hen house. https://t.co/kv70P9iquN,2019-09-26 20:48:04,Twitter Media Studio,40,141
Today Maguire told me he thought it was "prudent" to go to the DOJ instead of Congress...

Maguire gave veto power over who saw the #WhistleblowerComplaint to the same two people implicated in them.  If that decision wasn't challenged by the IG it would have prevented these allegations from ever reaching Congress.

Bigots can’t just come up to me anymore saying “we hate you all because you’re freaks weird or sick” like they used to - that’s a measure of our progress.

Criminality can't be the standard.

Why'd Acosta throw Epstein's prosecution? It doesn't add up. There's too much $$ around Epstein for there not to be more to this story.

Trump Admin has already granted South Carolina a waiver allowing orgs to sidestep Obama-era religious nondiscrimination rules. President Trump has also said he wants to broaden exemptions allowing discrimination against prospective #LGBTQ parents. https://t.co/jXbrWXdvdE,2019-02-13 18:36:09,Twitter Web Client,2,19
As a gay guy I had to fight tooth &amp; nail to adopt my kids. Best thing I've ever done - and I know how much it means to them to have a loving home. President Obama created rules preventing adoption/foster agencies from discriminating on a religious basis but could change soon... https://t.co/KCk2fkMNL9,2019-02-13 18:36:09,Twitter Web Client,37,246
Exactly. #GreenNewDeal is a call to arms. Yes the GND is bold. Getting to net zero carbon emissions by 2050 will be hard and we can (and will) argue about how to get there. But disagreement on the “how” isn’t a reason not to try. https://t.co/mFzYFN04rI,2019-02-13 16:28:14,Twitter Web Client,6,23
Great working with you @RepGraceMeng and @DWStweets. Thanks to @RepZoeLofgren's leadership policies on Capitol Hill are finally catching on to the fact that women work here. https://t.co/53DaGfr1I6,2019-02-12 21:23:54,Twitter Web Client,1,12
Saying tampons are superfluous but other hygiene products like hand sanitizer and tissues are totally necessary reinforces the idea that our rules are written by men for men &amp; that women are merely second-class citizens on Capitol Hill.

I sure don't agree with @IlhanMN statements &amp; I've already called them out.

Antisemitism doesn't have any place anywhere. But let's keep in mind this is coming from the same guy who cheers on the president for his racist statements including about Native Americans.

4/ If the EPA won't do its job Congress needs to take action. People in Newburgh were put in danger when their drinking water was contaminated with PFOS – we can’t let the EPA get away with turning their backs on us.  https://t.co/qb98lXdulo,2019-01-29 19:29:06,Twitter Web Client,1,6
3/ Now the EPA is reportedly finishing up a plan which would refrain from regulating PFOS/PFOA at all - even though we've seen studies on studies proving the chemicals can cause some cancers hypertension other problems. https://t.co/ankvdemaO3,2019-01-29 19:29:06,Twitter Web Client,0,1
2/ Last year Trump Administration tried to bury its OWN report on the health effects of drinking these chemicals. They were concerned it would be a "public relations nightmare."

1/ A few years back we found out the drinking water in Newburgh was contaminated w/dangerous chemicals (PFOS/PFOA) and have been working towards total remediation ever since.
