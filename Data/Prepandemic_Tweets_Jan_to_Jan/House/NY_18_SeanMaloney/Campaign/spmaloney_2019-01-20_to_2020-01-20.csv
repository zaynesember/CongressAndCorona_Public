If we want real progress &amp; enduring change - at the local state &amp; federal level - we've got to get young people to the polls. That means making it easier to vote. Glad NY is doing its part &amp; expanding preregistration for the next generation of leaders. https://t.co/r8ZJsESOzM,2020-01-16 19:22:25,Twitter Web App,4,9
As president Joe Biden will deliver the local tax relief infrastructure clean drinking water &amp; support for our military and veterans that the American public wants.

Trump has made us less safe &amp; more isolated.  At home our political process is so fractured working families are being left behind.  Joe Biden’s unmatched record command of foreign affairs &amp; vision for our future is the leadership we need to get us out of these dangerous times. https://t.co/arpVPsxxX6,2020-01-13 22:50:06,Twitter Web App,5,19
Joe hasn’t just advocated for progressive change throughout his career he’s delivered on it - from ushering through VAWA to fighting shoulder to shoulder with President Obama to pass the ACA and support marriage equality.  I know as president he’ll build on that progress. https://t.co/XEfFPHAog5,2020-01-13 20:39:00,TweetDeck,9,49
The next president faces a difficult task: restoring the US as a global leader &amp; bringing our country back together.  Joe Biden is the person for that job.

When we got elected to Congress together @BetoORourke and I used to run early in the morning out on the Mall in Washington. Through many long conversations and during our years together in the House I grew to know and love him and his family.,2019-03-14 20:32:32,Twitter Web Client,3,42
