Driving force behind this entire impeachment sham? Hatred.  Democrats care more about tearing President Trump DOWN than they do building America UP. This will backfire badly on them next November. #KeepAmericaGreat https://t.co/mOIa9lzX8s,2019-12-05 22:53:30,Twitter Media Studio,105,191

Targeting and harassing Americans because of their political beliefs is shameful and dangerous. What happened to “when they go low we go high?” Or does that no longer matter when your brother is polling at 1%?

There is a rising tide of anti-Semitism in the world a scourge that is spreading in the Middle East Europe and even here in the U.S.   Leaders on both sides of the aisle have a responsibility to confront this ugliness head-on.
