Graffiti in #Tehran this morning about #Suleimani “Trump Dastit Garim — Good Job Trump” @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/8K1iX4kVhb,2020-01-04 14:22:30,Twitter for iPhone,10,31
If Pres. Clinton had intel to prevent Khobar Towers I doubt @joebiden would have objected to striking the planners to stop the attack. https://t.co/RrSmDeUNlz,2020-01-04 14:15:44,Twitter for iPhone,6,12
Not any more #Suleimani. His replacement Qa’ani should be VERY careful. https://t.co/N1KXnWvcCP,2020-01-03 17:01:17,Twitter for iPhone,3,8
As a member of the Armed Services Comm had I discovered the Trump admin had actionable intel and let more Americans die I would be demanding accountability. Inaction has consequences too. ⁦⁦@realDonaldTrump⁩ had a duty to eliminate#Suleimani  https://t.co/l8L4FCWT4O,2020-01-03 16:45:17,Twitter for iPhone,16,39

The terrorists will not leave just bc US forces do...and still fully intend to attack the West...as we saw under #ISIS and Pres Obama.,2019-09-11 02:35:53,Twitter for iPhone,3,8
We have had 50k troops in Japan 30k in Korea 30-100k in Germany 70+ yrs since WWII. If the concern is bringing soldiers home cost or length of mission reductions in those countries are far less dangerous to US security,2019-09-11 02:35:53,Twitter for iPhone,5,12
Plus #ISIS is resurgent held back only by constant strikes by US/Afghan forces. We must 1. maintain pressure on the terrorist groups 2. continue to advise the Afghan Army until they can fully stand on their own. We are not nation-building/policing.,2019-09-11 02:35:53,Twitter for iPhone,3,4

Frustration among veterans w #Afghanistan is understandable.  Missing from the Vets panel discussion w @marthamaccallum is that Al Qaeda is NOT destroyed ISIS is on the rise and both will plan attacks on America again in the chaos of an American withdrawal.,2019-09-11 00:00:14,Twitter for iPhone,10,27
