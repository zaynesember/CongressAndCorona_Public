I'm a Green Beret and a proud veteran. This impeachment process does not make me proud.  As a sitting member of Congress I still can't read the transcripts on impeaching our President.  I've fought in third-world countries that have fairer processes than what we're seeing today. https://t.co/6QSf8V1qA4,2019-10-23 16:08:17,Twitter Media Studio,19238,48011
Staff did let us in the committee room.   My colleagues and I proceeded respectfully to ask for access to the witness testimony.   Now we’re being told @RepAdamSchiff is threatening us with ethics violations simply for requesting access to the transcripts in this process.,2019-10-23 14:57:03,Twitter for iPhone,53,87
Here now at the House Intelligence Committee demanding access to witness transcripts in this impeachment proceeding.   Staff won’t let us in. Why not?   This process should be open and transparent. The American people deserve it.,2019-10-23 14:05:32,Twitter for iPhone,153,396

I voted yes on this resolution.   Impeachment is possibly one of the most significant votes we will ever take in Congress.   The process should be fair and transparent — not a secret — sadly it seems @RepAdamSchiff has not shown the House much fairness or transparency so far. https://t.co/ZIilJ2SIOZ,2019-10-21 23:53:45,Twitter for iPhone,175,551

The impeachment inquiry is an investigation in search of a crime. @SecPompeo is right to push back on direct contact with State employees.

Thanks to all who took time to join me at the @Volusiachamber today. I know firsthand many of the challenges that come with building a business from the ground up.

We’re sending a clear message the U.S. stands w/ the people of #Venezuela taxpayer 💰 will not trickle down to Maduro &amp; that we expect accountability from those that do business with the U.S.  Grateful to have @SenRickScott &amp; @SenRubioPress championing this bill in the Senate. https://t.co/IUoQrSVYCI,2019-04-11 18:04:25,Twitter for iPhone,107,177
Jonathan Farmer was a fellow Floridian &amp; @usarmy Green Beret killed while deployed in Syria earlier this year. We laid him to rest in @ArlingtonNatl Tuesday. Honored to spend some time w/ his family at the @uscapitol today.  To all #GoldStar families you‘re always welcome here. https://t.co/DD9Gh6reGZ,2019-04-11 18:01:15,Twitter for iPhone,1,12
I give my @USNavy &amp; @USMC buddies a hard time (#GoArmy #BeatNavy) but I’m proud of their sacrifices to defend our country and committed to getting them the resources they need to get the job done. Thanks to @secnav76 @CNORichardson &amp; @CMC_MarineCorps for joining us today. https://t.co/Mgya4r51Sh,2019-04-10 20:36:40,Twitter for iPhone,3,13
My time as a Green Beret means I know the resources our special operators need to complete their mission successfully &amp; safely. Thank you to @USSOCOM Commander General Clarke &amp; @DeptofDefense Deputy Assistant Secretary Mitchell for sharing with us at @HASCRepublicans today. https://t.co/E1Ipr9i3Jy,2019-04-09 21:31:42,Twitter for iPhone,1,6
Every @POTUS deserves to have a fully-staffed Administration. The Senate confirmation process is important but what Senate Democrats are doing to drag this on indefinitely to prevent  @realDonaldTrump's nominees from even getting a fair hearing is WRONG. https://t.co/txJkAnP84R,2019-04-09 12:57:23,Twitter Web Client,1,3
I greatly admired @SecNielsen's advocacy for her @DHSgov employees during the longest shut down in history. Thankful to her for answering the call to serve our nation. Look forward to working with her successor to #SecureOurBorder &amp; support our @USCG. https://t.co/vfWvyBC47c,2019-04-09 12:55:20,Twitter Web Client,2,4
Great start to the day discussing the need for more bipartisanship and civility in Congress with #ForCountryCaucus co-chairs @RepDonBacon &amp; @RepJimmyPanetta and my fellow co-vice chair @RepHoulahan. https://t.co/5F5FHZsEBs,2019-04-09 12:11:22,Twitter for iPhone,0,14
Awesome to join @realdonaldtrump &amp; @GOPLeader on #Airforce1 #AF1 this past weekend after @POTUS’s important speech in support of our alliance with #Israel. https://t.co/R3ejoNTWqI,2019-04-08 19:26:49,Twitter for iPhone,23,169
Congress gets lots of things wrong but making the #AirForce keep the A-10 was one it definitely got right!  https://t.co/y46qtRrKQh,2019-04-06 14:13:18,Twitter for iPhone,0,11
Today I asked the House to consider the #BornAliveAct. For the 29th time the Speaker of the House denied a @HouseGOP member’s request. This shouldn’t be a controversial vote – babies born alive deserve full medical attention. #EndInfanticide https://t.co/CZGeeGwkJJ,2019-04-04 18:42:51,Twitter for iPhone,285,724

Two items outside the #NATO HQ in Brussels. 1. A piece of the Berlin Wall and 2. Twisted steel from World Trade Center. Symbols of freedom and solidarity. Defeated communism and now defeating terrorism. #NATO democracies standing strong 👊 https://t.co/cCQyDw2LyF,2019-04-03 15:28:30,Twitter for iPhone,0,7

I wouldn’t be alive today if it wasn’t for the @usairforce. Thankful to @SecAFOfficial &amp; @GenDaveGoldfein for discussing the importance of close air support for combat troops on the ground at @HASCRepublicans hearing. https://t.co/17mD3458vg,2019-04-02 21:23:08,Twitter for iPhone,6,44
