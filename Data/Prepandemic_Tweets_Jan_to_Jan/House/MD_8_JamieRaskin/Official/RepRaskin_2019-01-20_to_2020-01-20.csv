George Kent and other State Department officers were trying to dislodge a culture of corruption in Ukraine and end Banana Republic rule there. Trump and Giuliani wanted to reinstate the corruption to help turn America into a Banana Republic. https://t.co/6MSIrWuzlz,2019-11-07 21:51:46,Twitter for iPhone,51,123
George Kent describes how Rudy Giuliani operating as the President’s lawyer conducted a relentless smear and propaganda campaign against our US Ambassador Yovanovitch. Trump and his henchmen viewed her as an obstacle to their corrupt schemes so they drove her from office. https://t.co/8Km2MwQt8q,2019-11-07 21:43:12,Twitter for iPhone,42,96
Another deposition confirms Trump’s shakedown of Ukraine to produce dirt on political opponents. In George Kent’s words Trump’s goal was “nothing less” than to get President Zelensky to go to the microphone and say “investigations Biden and Clinton.” https://t.co/SKLK1jSw9T,2019-11-07 21:36:20,Twitter for iPhone,223,523

Under the USDA’s proposed rule change an estimated 50000 Marylanders could lose SNAP benefits.

The safety of America’s Kurdish allies &amp; the coherence of our foreign policy are no match for Trump’s overwhelming “conflict of interest” in making sure the Turkish government treats Trump Tower in Istanbul nicely.

Amazing to me that GOP Members can call out Trump for his outrageous betrayal of the Kurds but not his outrageous betrayal of the Americans.

U.S. refugee law requires that the Administration consult Congress on resettlement numbers. The law demands it &amp; so does Congress.

Trump continues to degrade our values by proposing to slash FY2020 refugee admissions to 18000 the lowest level in American history. At a time of huge refugee flows this verges on being a refugee ban. This is shocking. https://t.co/wLJw8rCjoD,2019-09-27 18:33:29,Twitter for iPhone,52,133
The House proudly joins the Senate in rejecting Trump’s “emergency” declaration to build his fantasy wall and violate Congress’ will.
