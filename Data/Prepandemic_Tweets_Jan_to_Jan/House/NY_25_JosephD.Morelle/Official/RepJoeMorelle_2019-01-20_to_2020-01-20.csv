As Congress and the President work towards a bold $2 trillion infrastructure package it is imperative that the agreement invests in long-term flood mitigation efforts for communities along the Great Lakes whose residents and business owners face the threat of severe flooding. https://t.co/tIiBzMOWhR,2019-05-03 23:01:10,Sprout Social,3,17
