Immigrants are already required to give out a lot of personal identifying information to immigration officials. Forcing them to give up DNA data jeopardizes their civil and privacy rights.  No one deserves this type of government surveillance and unjust criminalization. (5/6),2020-01-08 17:35:11,Twitter Web App,4,14
This type of DNA data collection is completely unjustified and can have harmful and long-lasting consequences.

DHS is attempting to justify these DNA collection practices by characterizing immigrants in detention as “potential criminals.”   This blatantly xenophobic practice aims to miscast immigrants as inherently dangerous.

This White House memo is merely a summary of President Trump’s conversation with the president of Ukraine it's not a transcript. What we read underscores why Congress needs to see the full whistleblower report.   Trump's behavior is un-American and a danger to our democracy.,2019-09-25 16:53:56,Twitter Web App,15,35
The memo points to several instances that demand a closer look:  🚩 P. 3: “I would like you to do us a favor though…” 🚩 P. 3: “Whatever you can do it’s very important that you do it if that’s possible.” 🚩 P. 4: "so if you can look into it…”  This isn't normal or acceptable. https://t.co/umF3h6Tv5H,2019-09-25 16:53:56,Twitter Web App,11,27
The memo released by the White House is damning. And the fact that Trump thinks that this doesn't point to any wrongdoing speaks volumes about what his administration finds to be “acceptable” behavior. #CultureOfCorruption,2019-09-25 16:53:55,Twitter Web App,14,42

.@BetsyDeVosED is emboldening the for-profit industry and making it easier for predatory institutions to target student veterans and cheat them out of their benefits. It’s up to Congress to hold these institutions accountable and protect GI Bill benefits. https://t.co/4m0uC1tbVA,2019-02-19 18:08:48,Twitter for iPhone,30,50

The inhumanity behind the internment of Japanese Americans is a stain on the fabric of our country that was born out of hate and politics rooted in fearmongering. We must ensure that no person is ever a target of despicable policies that are discriminatory and un-American. https://t.co/rX0IvHVgn3,2019-02-15 23:34:46,Twitter for iPhone,34,93
Declaring a national emergency over a fabricated border crisis is an abuse of power.

A $2.13 minimum wage for tipped workers is a shameful reality in most parts of the country. No worker should have to rely on their tips alone to make ends meet. That's why supporting #OneFairWage is not only the morally right thing to do it's the economically smart thing to do. https://t.co/8eDUl6aBKn,2019-02-13 16:49:52,Twitter Web Client,47,151
