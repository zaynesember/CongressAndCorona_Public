Denver Post Editorial: “We have determined — based on hours of sworn testimony text messages emails and the president’s own words — that Trump has so abused the power of his office that for him to remain in the White House is a threat to our democracy.” https://t.co/tGm2WVYsdi,2019-12-18 02:50:02,Twitter for iPhone,4,14
