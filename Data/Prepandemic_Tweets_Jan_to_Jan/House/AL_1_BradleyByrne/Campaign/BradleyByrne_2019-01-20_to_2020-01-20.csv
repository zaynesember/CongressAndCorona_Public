Very special to be at the 20th Special Forces Group reunion today in Mobile. My brother Dale served in this group and it was great to catch up with many old friends.   My favorite quote of the day was:   “Bradley in this room you are Dale’s little brother.” https://t.co/RneSefxvDg,2020-01-19 02:15:07,Twitter for iPhone,4,35
This is EXACTLY why I want Joe Biden and his family investigated! They get all these sweetheart deals without any experience. I’ve spent my life fighting this kind of corruption and it is time we get some answers from the Bidens. https://t.co/YlsYfJyDor,2020-01-18 23:07:14,Twitter for iPhone,99,271

Captain Hal was a legend. He loved his country our community and the @USNavy. He was an incredibly loyal and faithful friend and he could always put a smile on your face.

A lot of discussion around the importance of supporting Alabama’s coal industry at our Brookwood town hall this evening. We need to end the war on coal and support President Trump’s energy independent agenda! https://t.co/bw8ZQSImyV,2020-01-18 01:08:07,Twitter for iPhone,14,35

The radical Left is trying to strip away our Second Amendment rights! If we don’t stop them they are going to keep passing law after law to take away our right to own a gun. I’m running for the Senate to protect the Second Amendment! #2A https://t.co/eiSK5KmYP1,2020-01-17 22:28:34,Twitter for iPhone,20,53

Q: Do you support term limits?   “This seat we’re running for doesn’t belong to any one person. It belongs to the people of Alabama. Term limits ensure that the people going up there don’t ever become comfortable in the halls of Congress. I’ll continue to fight for term limits.”,2020-01-17 02:10:56,Twitter for iPhone,2,23
Q: What can we do better to protect &amp; support law enforcement?  Too many people in our society don’t respect them. When I think about them disrespecting our officers like my brother Dale &amp; the brave law enforcement who put our safety above their own that burns me up. #ALSen,2020-01-17 01:33:18,Twitter for iPhone,3,15
Q: How do you feel about amnesty?   “I appose amnesty. When someone comes across our border illegally they have broken our laws. If we’re going to be a nation of laws — we better enforce them.” #ALSen,2020-01-17 01:16:31,Twitter for iPhone,5,30
Q: What’s an area you believe should be reserved for states?  “The federal gov needs to get out of education. We do NOT need a U.S. Department of Education. I trust our local school boards far more to know what our students should be learning than those people up in Washington.”,2020-01-17 00:59:41,Twitter for iPhone,2,16
Q: How do you feel about red flag laws?   I don’t support them because they violate our due process rights under the Constitution. This issue comes down to a morality conflict of good vs. evil. We don’t need new law!,2020-01-17 00:53:24,Twitter for iPhone,1,7

Grateful to have the opportunity to visit with voters at the Elmore GOP Forum last night.   If you want to be a U.S. Senator you need to show up take questions and listen to the people of Alabama.

What could go wrong with Adam Schiff and Jerry Nadler handling the impeachment case in the Senate??? They’ve made a laughing stock of this entire process!   President @realDonaldTrump and @TeamTrump should be as confident as ever with this clown show moving to the Senate. 🤡,2020-01-15 15:38:50,Twitter for iPhone,61,305
New York City is responsible for this murder. If not for their illegal sanctuary city laws this murderer would’ve been deported &amp; an American would still be alive.   @realDonaldTrump is right we must abolish sanctuary cities to keep our communities safe! https://t.co/MmHFemho53,2020-01-15 13:34:48,Twitter for iPhone,144,260
The same DC atheist group that’s attacking me for protecting Christian values is running ads like this:  “Ron Reagan life-long atheist not afraid of burning in hell."

I refuse to sit back &amp; let @FFRF bully Alabamians like Coach Johnson &amp; those young boys for simply living out their faith.

I’ve had enough of this sham. @SpeakerPelosi is guilty of the exact thing she falsely accused @realDonaldTrump of.

@IlhanOmar @realDonaldTrump Maybe she wishes Obama were still here to bow before the Ayatollah but here in America we serve the Constitution of the U.S. first and swear in front of God to defend this country and its people. And that’s exactly what President Trump is doing.,2020-01-03 23:28:22,Twitter Web App,6,37
.@IlhanOmar diminished 9/11 opposes Israel and now she is upset that President @realDonaldTrump took out a murderous terrorist – at this point we have to wonder what side is she on? https://t.co/rxr5pHcqvV,2020-01-03 23:27:51,Twitter Web App,61,183

.@IlhanMN cheapened 9/11 by saying "some people did something” and now she’s trying to diminish our military’s heroic action.   Soleimani killed innocent Americans.

Let us know! #SOTU https://t.co/8uVELz8YqB,2019-02-05 15:15:06,Twitter Web Client,2,13
As the debate around late-term abortion and infanticide rages on my hope is that the American people will speak out and tell Senator @DougJones and the liberal Democrats that when it comes to things like this we’re not going to stand for it. #ProLife https://t.co/HXtXY0lpcN,2019-02-05 02:30:00,TweetDeck,9,39
Broadband expansion? Support for Alabama farmers? Protecting the unborn? Building the wall? Let President @realDonaldTrump know what you want to hear in his #SOTU speech 👇 https://t.co/QQ56vCpfoT,2019-02-04 23:37:39,Twitter Web Client,3,11
Every life is precious and worth fighting for. It's heartbreaking to hear the Democrats talking so casually about taking the life of a baby. We cannot sit back and allow this to stand. We must speak out and take action. https://t.co/h9lLJ0DVKB,2019-02-04 16:10:41,Twitter Web Client,8,38

Senator @DougJones is pro-abortion. Is he for infanticide? The people of Alabama deserve to know...   https://t.co/N1ETs0CX0w,2019-02-01 18:00:28,Twitter Web Client,30,90
The idea that you could abort a baby during the course of delivery is sickening and barbaric. Shocked to see so many Democrats encourage this shameful act of murder. My hope is that the American people will speak out to #ResistInfanticide and embrace the gift of life.,2019-02-01 17:42:42,TweetDeck,9,49

The fact that Virginia Gov. Northam endorsed post-birth abortion is appalling. Every life is precious and to abort a child is as much the ending of life as any other form of murder.    https://t.co/jBJr8V4KWe,2019-02-01 00:08:26,Twitter Web Client,2,18
