The big partisan show I saw in today’s impeachment hearing was truly sad. Democrats have taken the Intelligence Committee which is historically bipartisan and turned it into the Impeachment Committee. This show is about politics not oversight! https://t.co/4PLdrlWL46,2019-11-20 22:08:54,Twitter Media Studio,61,118
I just left the impeachment hearing room where yet ANOTHER witness called by the Democrats admitted he has NO FIRSTHAND KNOWLEDGE of @realDonaldTrump ordering any pre-conditions for aid or a White House meeting! Why are we wasting time on this? https://t.co/yjykZdDOD7,2019-11-20 20:53:47,Twitter Media Studio,1269,2787
Democrats are so focused on impeaching @realDonaldTrump that they’ve neglected to perform Congress’s core responsibility of funding the government on time.

Yesterday’s hearing was so boring because there’s no “there” there. There is no impeachable offense. @realDonaldTrump did nothing wrong.

The Democrats have stopped talking about “quid pro quo” because it isn’t working for them. Why not?

Democrats are justifying impeachment with office gossip from a few people standing around a water cooler in the White House.

In the transcript neither @realDonaldTrump nor President Zelensky said one word about the hold. Why? Because there was NO bribery NO extortion and NO quid pro quo! https://t.co/jhgIosWAwn,2019-11-14 20:05:51,Twitter Media Studio,15,29

@realDonaldTrump Democrats made a critical error in orchestrating their impeachment scheme. They underestimated the resolve of the American people that elected @realDonaldTrump.

@realDonaldTrump This entire process from its very inception has been a hypocritical shameful exercise in partisan political opportunism. There is no substance here. None of @realDonaldTrump’s actions even approach anything remotely near impeachable conduct.,2019-11-13 23:43:50,Twitter Web App,28,69
@realDonaldTrump Despite this sham of a process we have no evidence that @realDonaldTrump ordered any kind of quid pro quo NONE. The call transcript shows NO demand President Zelensky says there was NO demand and NO EVIDENCE shows President Trump ordered a demand.,2019-11-13 23:40:26,Twitter Web App,7,11
@realDonaldTrump The only witness with any serious contact with @realDonaldTrump Ambassador Sondland testified he called Trump and asked about one of the Democrat witnesses raising the rumor of quid pro quo with him. The President directly told him “There is no quid pro quo. No quid pro quo.”,2019-11-13 23:38:43,Twitter Web App,6,15
@realDonaldTrump Witnesses have speculated why aid was held but when pressed all said some version of “I don’t know.” We have a lot of bureaucratic gossip here but NOT ONE PERSON has testified they had any direct knowledge that @realDonaldTrump ordered to hold aid for a political favor!,2019-11-13 23:36:09,Twitter Web App,5,16
@realDonaldTrump The hold placed on assistance to Ukraine was placed before the phone call that @realDonaldTrump had with President Zelensky. In the transcript neither president said one word about the hold! If Trump were trying to use the aid for extorsion he would have at least mentioned it!,2019-11-13 23:33:40,Twitter Web App,6,14
@realDonaldTrump President @realDonaldTrump took the extraordinary step of releasing the transcript of this supposedly extraordinary call. You can read the entire transcript online.

Democrats have IGNORED House rules that Congressmen can observe unclassified hearings and view committee records. These records don’t belong to Adam Schiff or Speaker Pelosi or even to ME. They belong to the American people! But all the transcripts still haven't been released.,2019-11-13 23:26:57,Twitter Web App,13,22
Democrats made a spectacle about holding their first public hearing today. The truth is that today’s hearing is little more than a public showcasing of witnesses they’ve already interrogated &amp; vetted in their secret room to ensure they will say only what the Democrats desire.,2019-11-13 23:24:20,Twitter Web App,47,105
There’s been a lot of noise rumors and confusion about exactly what’s happened. That’s by design.

Amb. Sondland testified that Trump told him he wasn’t holding funds up for a quid pro quo.

Amb. Volker said there was no linkage between WH meetings &amp; investigations or conditions for release of funds. Ukraine didn’t even know funds were on hold.

Amb. Yovanovitch was upset that @realDonaldTrump fired her after rumors she was badmouthing him. Is that impeachable? Ambassadors serve at the pleasure of the President. Amb.

The Green New Deal is nothing more than a #GreedyNewSteal on the part of Congressional Dems that would steal personal freedoms and crash our economy.

Today marks #100DaysofDems in control. Check out this list from @SteveScalise below for a recap of Dem craziness.

Canada is doing what Dems in Congress can't. How can Dem leaders allow our border to remain porous threatening the safety and security of Americans ignoring the very real crisis at the Southern Border? It's unimaginable that it has gotten to this point.  https://t.co/P1OYvvDp6L,2019-04-12 01:26:00,TweetDeck,6,14
This is almost laughable if it weren’t true. Democrats have proven they cannot lead in the House and that they would rather pander to the far-left by funding socialist programs. I will not stand for socialism at the expense of the taxpayer.  https://t.co/jfw0afICwL,2019-04-11 23:22:00,TweetDeck,5,19
As I have said many times more and more people will continue to flock to our border if we don't crack down and do something to get a handle on this national security crisis.

Not terribly long ago there was a time in our country that the very concept of aborting a child was almost universally rejected as immoral. Dem can’t even agree to ban infanticide.

ICYMI: The Constitution gives Congress investigative powers in order to carry out its legitimate duties not to fish for partisan election material.

It is clear that the majority doesn't seek @POTUS’s tax returns information about his business or to haul his family before Congress for some legislative purposes.

ICYMI: I considered listing tangible Dem achievements in their first 100 days but that would result in a blank.

I ask the majority to think about their Constitutional obligations. It is your right to oppose @POTUS at the ballot box not to use this body to score political points. There's no legitimate purpose for Congress to investigate @POTUS or his family before he was elected to office.,2019-04-09 14:47:25,Twitter Web Client,12,20
@HouseDemocrats want to use Congress to investigate the past personal &amp; business dealings of an elected official &amp; his family to coerce &amp; intimidate people with whom they disagree. This isn’t legitimate. It’s a witch hunt. It undermines legitimate investigations in the future.,2019-04-09 14:46:54,Twitter Web Client,0,0
@HouseDemocrats don't seek @realdonaldtrump’s tax returns information about his business or to haul his family before Congress in an effort to pass new laws or for some other legislative purposes.

@POTUS's political opponents tried and failed to make his tax returns and business dealings an issue in the 2016 Presidential election. The American people settled that issue at the ballot box.,2019-04-09 14:45:10,Twitter Web Client,1,1
The Supreme Court has repeatedly affirmed investigations conducted by the House must be related to a legitimate task of Congress &amp; has warned that investigations of private affairs of individuals are off limits without a clear connection to this body’s constitutional functions.,2019-04-09 14:44:46,Twitter Web Client,3,4

Our system is one of limited powers of checks and balances. The Congress is not a law enforcement agency. It is not a court of law. It is a legislative body. We are a nation of laws and of liberty. These so-called investigations set a dangerous precedent.,2019-04-09 14:43:52,Twitter Web Client,2,9
Democrat-run House Committees are investigating @realdonaldtrump's business dealings long before he was elected &amp; may call members of his family to testify about Trump Organization dealings. These actions are not only blatantly partisan but raise serious constitutional concerns.,2019-04-09 14:43:34,Twitter Web Client,2,3

If Democrats get their way the national security crisis will only intensify. By capping the number of beds in ICE facilities they will be forced to release over 9000 criminal illegal aliens. That is dangerous irresponsible and unacceptable. https://t.co/JA6k0fUVc3,2019-02-12 02:37:00,TweetDeck,2,8
I agree with Dr. @BruceAshford of the Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary: “This unashamed movement to undermine the sanctity of human life must be resisted not only by Congress but by the citizens of our great nation. https://t.co/CP4anl9Byk,2019-02-12 01:01:00,TweetDeck,2,8
It makes no sense to reduce the number of spaces available for ICE to detain criminals. Dems seem intent on doing anything to push their open border policies. I continue to stand with @POTUS.

This is the extent that the left will go to push their radical agenda: banning “emissions” from cows and air travel.
