Rest assured I will never stop fighting for @realDonaldTrump or his agenda that will keep our nation moving forward – and I will always be the first to call out Democrats in Congress who refuse to accept the results of the 2016 election and do the job they were elected to do. https://t.co/LpZ6EvapM9,2019-11-25 16:35:00,TweetDeck,5,15

The only issue Dems have with #USMCA is that it’s a win for @realDonaldTrump. Dems continue to put politics before people. It’s a win for KS a win for USA and a win for North America.

Steve Watkins went against the DCCC's best candidate in over a decade and over $5million in outside spending and won in 2018. Winning is what Watkins does. It is no surprise insiders are once again trying to force out an outsider.,2019-08-27 19:58:49,Twitter for iPhone,7,18
