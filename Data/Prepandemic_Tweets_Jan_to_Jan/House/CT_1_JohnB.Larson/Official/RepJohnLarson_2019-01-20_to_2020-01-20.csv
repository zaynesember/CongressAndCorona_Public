Yesterday I joined federal aviation workers at Bradley to stand in solidarity with them. I’ve voted 11 times to reopen the government. It’s time for the Senate to join the House in passing a bill to reopen the government. #EndtheShutdownNow https://t.co/POhVwjwSQK,2019-01-25 16:51:16,Twitter Media Studio,3,14
It is unconscionable that our air traffic controllers TSA agents border patrol &amp; other dedicated employees are set to miss a 2nd paycheck. The House has voted 10 times to reopen the govt. I urge every Senator to support the CR that would reopen the govt and #EndTheShutdownNow,2019-01-23 22:39:01,Twitter Web Client,5,10
Today I again voted to reopen the Federal Government. Every day the government remains shuttered the consequences become more severe and the burden placed on federal workers and contractors becomes heavier.,2019-01-23 22:39:01,Twitter Web Client,6,14

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. told us that "Human progress never rolls in on wheels of inevitability; it comes through the tireless efforts of men". Today I join men and women across the nation in remembering Dr. King by recommitting ourselves to that effort for human progress.,2019-01-21 14:00:47,Twitter for iPhone,4,21
