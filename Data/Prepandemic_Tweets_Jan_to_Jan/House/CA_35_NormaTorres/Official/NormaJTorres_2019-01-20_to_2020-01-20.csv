Right now @RulesDemocrats are working to ensure that not a single veteran goes without the mental healthcare they need because they can't afford childcare. @HouseGOP has somehow managed to turn this into a discussion about union issues. Our servicemembers deserve better. https://t.co/lliuH78FvK,2019-02-06 21:10:28,Twitter Web Client,3,7

In tonight's #SOTU @realDonaldTrump missed yet another opportunity to unify the American people. We need real solutions to fix our broken roads and bridges strengthen security at our ports of entry #RaiseTheWage and prevent a shutdown from hurting federal workers again. https://t.co/ygJRd1hGwB,2019-02-06 05:23:06,Twitter for iPhone,51,186
And let's not forget that @realDonaldTrump was willing to give @VP &amp; his political appointees $10K raises but couldn't muster a 2.6% raise for federal workers. #SOTU https://t.co/f8LRtsmnb2,2019-02-06 03:36:22,Twitter for iPhone,20,21
Last year @realDonaldTrump said car companies were expanding their manufacturing plants in the US. FACT: Just today GM began to layoff 4K salaried workers: https://t.co/qUwV5AxZsc,2019-02-06 03:36:21,Twitter for iPhone,8,11
President Trump promised that lowering the business tax rate would create jobs. FACT: the $1.5 Trillion tax cut had no effect on investment or hiring: https://t.co/3PFwjlBOpz,2019-02-06 03:36:21,Twitter for iPhone,7,5
That’s why last week @HouseDemocrats voted to give our federal civilian workers a raise that recognizes the dignity of their work. #SOTU2019,2019-02-06 03:36:20,Twitter for iPhone,5,6
Don't be fooled by tonight’s speech.  @realDonaldTrump doesn't care about our federal workers. Not only did he make our workers undergo a 35-day shutdown miss two paychecks and cause panic to American families he voted to freeze a much needed pay raise for this year.

Why I’m skeptical: During last year's #SOTU @realDonaldTrump claimed that reducing the price of prescription drugs was one of his administration's top priorities.

Our economy isn’t strong when wealthy shareholders and corporate executives have bankrupted the middle class under the Trump-GOP tax law. Even worse our children will have to deal with the massive debt that the #GOPTaxScam has created. #SOTU19,2019-02-06 02:25:04,Twitter for iPhone,15,31
