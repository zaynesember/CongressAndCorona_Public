Covered a lot of ground on @MeetThePress Daily with @ChuckTodd today about the #Mueller Hearing.   👉 $25M 19 lawyers 40 FBI agents = no collusion 👉 1/2 of Mueller's team had conflicts 👉 Presumption of innocence &amp; proof beyond a reasonable doubt are bedrock of legal system https://t.co/CXlGiJPseC,2019-07-24 23:35:00,Twitter Media Studio,77,197
The presumption of innocence and proof beyond a reasonable doubt are the bedrock of our legal system. In the #Mueller hearing my friends on the other side of the aisle seem to have forgotten that.

It's not enough for Mr. Mueller to be able to vouch for his team. Federal recusal law exists for a reason. The interest of justice demands that no perceived biases exist.   I can't imagine a judge I've appeared in front of who would be comfortable with these circumstances. https://t.co/qX6ocZBnGJ,2019-07-24 17:05:24,Twitter Media Studio,12153,38699
Of the 19 lawyers on Mueller's team half of them had a direct relationship political or personal with the opponent of who he was investigating.   They donated $12k to Clinton. That's not even counting the $49k donated to other Democrats.  Watch my questions for Mueller: https://t.co/QMrY0x6GEv,2019-07-24 16:20:57,Twitter Media Studio,4792,11586

Rather than working with the administration to stem the flow of illegal drugs and stop human trafficking across the border House Democrats took a political vote on legislation that has zero chance of becoming law. #116thCongress #SecureTheBorder,2019-02-26 23:37:32,Twitter for iPhone,5,25
There is a humanitarian and national security crisis on our southern border. The president took decisive action to secure the border by using authority delegated to him by Congress in case of a national emergency. #116thCongress #SecureTheBorder,2019-02-26 23:37:32,Twitter for iPhone,21,49
I stood with my colleagues to defend the #2ndAmendment today. I’ll vote no on the gun control bill #HR8. It’s bad policy and significantly curtails Rural America’s 2nd Amendment rights. #support2a https://t.co/SjMzqC7yK3,2019-02-26 19:31:55,Twitter for iPhone,285,1101
I don't understand why the Democrats' gun control bill (#HR8) includes exceptions for hunting trapping and fishing but not farming and ranching. I fought for an amendment that adds two simple words: Farming and Ranching. Unfortunately the committee did not accept my amendment. https://t.co/K6ZiFbxsYm,2019-02-26 0:49:23,Twitter Media Studio,22,59
Agriculture is a $10 billion sector in #NorthDakota. I was glad to welcome Gov. @DougBurgum to DC today to discuss how we can grow our ag industry and support farmers and ranchers. https://t.co/CQgo1MIOAf,2019-02-25 23:22:26,TweetDeck,4,33
Thank you to @MinotDailyNews Editorial Board for letting me come in and talk about my first several weeks as North Dakota's Congressman. https://t.co/GKeufTO6u9 https://t.co/HPOuGRWNZu,2019-02-25 14:46:38,Twitter Web Client,1,12
This is great news and a good sign of progress in the ongoing trade negotiations.   I heard from North Dakota farmers this week that this is a top priority. Thank you @SecretarySonny and @POTUS for fighting for our ag industry. https://t.co/8tsjrRnnsL,2019-02-22 23:41:23,Twitter for iPhone,1,12

The move would save up to $15 billion over ten years. That's real savings for the American people. #NorthDakota #116thCongress 4/,2019-02-21 15:07:32,Twitter Web Client,0,2
The proposed change would eliminate loopholes abused by states which allow people to stay on the program without being encouraged to find meaningful employment. #NorthDakota #116thCongress 3/,2019-02-21 15:07:32,Twitter Web Client,0,5
Food stamps are intended to help those in need get back on their feet back in the workforce and become self-sufficient. With the economy as strong as it is right now we should encourage work for those able to not discourage it. #NorthDakota #116thCongress 2/,2019-02-21 15:07:32,Twitter Web Client,0,5
I announced my support for much-needed food stamp reforms this week. These changes eliminate loopholes in work requirement for able-bodied adults without dependents. #NorthDakota #116thCongress 1/,2019-02-21 15:07:32,Twitter Web Client,3,10
The 5th Bomb Wing “Warbirds” and the 91st Missile Wing “Rough Riders” call @TeamMinot home.

The fund created by the Restore Our Parks and Public Lands Act is funded by existing revenues from energy projects operating on federal land. As an avid outdoorsman I treasure our national parks and this bill is a common-sense way to address the maintenance backlog. #NorthDakota,2019-02-19 16:10:37,Twitter Web Client,0,0
#NorthDakota @NatlParkService sites have $52m in deferred maintenance most of which is at @TRooseveltNPS. This is why I cosponsored the Restore Our Parks and Public Lands Act which creates a fund to reduce deferred maintenance backlogs at national parks.,2019-02-19 16:10:37,Twitter Web Client,1,12

The bill also includes victories for ND. Rural North Dakotans farmers and ranchers all benefit. While it’s far from perfect the funding for the border barrier 1200 new @CBP agents along with the wins for the ND ag community outweigh my significant concerns with the bill.,2019-02-15 3:10:25,Twitter for iPhone,0,11
I voted tonight to build 55 miles of new physical barriers on the southern border in addition to $22.5 billion in other border security measures. This is an important step to secure the US-Mexico border and ending the humanitarian crisis.,2019-02-15 3:10:25,Twitter for iPhone,0,18

I'm fighting for the 2nd Amendment rights of #farmers and #ranchers. #HR8 makes felons out of thousands of North Dakotans who lend a firearm to a friend on their own land.  It's clear that those pushing this bill have not spent much time in rural America. https://t.co/bnX2KB5P8q,2019-02-14 16:25:22,Twitter Media Studio,8,27
My amendment to #HR8 includes ranching and farming along with hunting fishing and trapping for legally lending a gun. The bill as written makes felons out of thousands of ranchers and farmers.   This amendment is common-sense. I urge my colleagues to adopt it.,2019-02-14 0:43:03,TweetDeck,17,55
Today the House Judiciary Commitee will vote on #HR8 a misguided bill that makes felons out of thousands of farm and ranch kids (my statement in the hearing last week below).

The #GreenNewDeal is a raw deal for North Dakota and all of America. It’s a ridiculous proposal from beginning to end.   ND grows the world’s food &amp; produces the world’s energy.

House Republicans have repeatedly tried to give federal workers their missed paychecks.
