It's been an honor to serve this great state and I got to share the work I've done these past few months during a stop in Hillsboro on Monday. I look forward to visiting with even more North Dakotans in Valley City tonight.  https://t.co/PreeH8BjKO,2019-04-24 18:57:12,Twitter Web Client,1,16

That’s not how this works. That is not how any of this works. Banks make loans. Companies operate pipelines which are without a doubt the safest way to transport oil.  ND is proud to power the world.

Socialism flies in the face of ND values &amp; individual liberty. We should be alarmed that Democrats in ND are continuing down the path of radicalism in embracing a doctrine responsible for pain and suffering of millions throughout history. This has to stop. https://t.co/iuSgetBfIv,2019-02-19 20:35:25,Buffer,12,33

@McFeely_Inforum Hey Mike you can follow our official page at @RepArmstrongND. This is my campaign page where I will occasionally talk about politics. You can follow my personal page @armstrong_km but that’s mostly baseball and sports stuff.,2019-02-17 16:54:36,Twitter for iPhone,1,10
You weren’t invited as a potential candidate. You were there as a former VP. And to tell our allies that we shouldn’t criticize each other in public while slamming your own country in public seems a tad hypocritical....,2019-02-17 16:35:10,Twitter for iPhone,2,17

.@SpeakerPelosi a decision as significant as denying @realDonaldTrump an invitation to deliver the State of the Union deserves a vote. Bring it to the floor so every member of Congress can weigh in. I think you know that the resolution would pass with democratic support. #SOTU,2019-01-24 12:18:04,Twitter for iPhone,6,27
Of all of Dr. King’s quotes this is my favorite. It is succinct and impactful.  The message is direct and the logic is unassailable. We have come a long way in and have a long way to go. Thank you for sharing @DougBurgum https://t.co/tJexlNoinV,2019-01-21 16:45:34,Twitter for iPhone,3,20
