As I discussed with @EsperDoD yesterday if we cannot identify a high impact light footprint approach in @CENTCOM it will suck up the majority of resources time and attention and @INDOPACOM will not get the priority and the resources that it needs. https://t.co/wEBybyz0eI,2019-12-12 14:27:05,Twitter Web App,7,14
While the FBI is full of hardworking patriotic employees the mistakes detailed in this report force us to consider making broader changes. If these errors could happen when those involved knew they would be watched closely they could happen to anyone.,2019-12-11 23:05:49,Twitter Web App,0,5
FISA abuse matters. This surveillance is one of the most intrusive interactions Americans can experience with law enforcement and if abused it undermines the rule of law and trust. We are not the Chinese Communist Party and must reject mass arbitrary surveillance.,2019-12-11 23:05:48,Twitter Web App,0,9
In one instance an FBI lawyer misled the FISA court by altering an email from another government agency that could have cast doubt on the advisability of a FISA renewal application before the court. The altered email was used as evidence to renew the warrant.,2019-12-11 23:05:48,Twitter Web App,0,6
THREAD➡️Despite claims by James Comey &amp; some in the media the IG report doesn't exonerate the FBI. Instead it shows that leaders entrusted with our national security &amp; rule of law failed to follow established procedures when the stakes were highest.

Acting SecNav is exactly right. We need a 355 ship Navy within the decade not 30 years from now when it will be too late. It’s possible with the right resourcing and enough creativity. Ten years. Let’s make the case and get it done. https://t.co/YzMdNb3h8r,2019-12-11 20:22:53,Twitter for iPhone,3,8

The lesson I take from all this is full speed ahead. We need maximum pressure on the CCP and recent events show that when the CCP is exposed for what it is good things happen. It would be great power competition malpractice for us not to make the Party’s job more difficult.,2019-11-27 22:15:55,Twitter for iPhone,32,138
If that wasn't a big enough blow for General Secretary Xi we’ve now seen rebukes of his rule in the form of leaks of highly classified information that detail the horrors of Xinjiang. It sure looks like some are trying to discredit Xi and I’m interested to see where things go.,2019-11-27 22:15:54,Twitter for iPhone,26,114
It's worth unpacking that pro-Democracy parties won about 85% of the seats in Hong Kong’s local elections. This is a truly monumental shift. It’s all the more incredible because some leading pro-democracy candidates including @joshuawongcf were barred from running for office.,2019-11-27 22:15:54,Twitter for iPhone,34,134
Much like Cold War Berlin Hong Kong has become the epicenter of the struggle between totalitarianism &amp; the free world. Last week's election was a major win for the good guys &amp; goes to show that the Chinese people can overwhelmingly reject the CCP when it shows its true colors.,2019-11-27 22:15:52,Twitter for iPhone,1160,1695

And while we’re at it we also have to get garbage food out of the chow halls and re-emphasize service member nutrition. There’s a lot to do but improving nutrition alone will go a long way towards creating a more fit and lethal fighting force.,2019-11-27 15:19:16,Twitter for iPhone,0,8
In the spirit of half baked ideas with @JonahDispatch a better approach might be to recruit academically-inclined college athletes. They’ll already have the ability to achieve &amp; maintain USMC fitness standards &amp; they'll be up to speed on the latest commercial fitness products.,2019-11-27 15:19:15,Twitter for iPhone,0,3
Fitness is an underappreciated component of national &amp; service member readiness. It’s no surprise that the @USMC is putting a premium on it. But I’m not sure that developing service-specific apps makes sense when there’s a growing private sector industry of health-oriented apps. https://t.co/Hpev7jTB36,2019-11-27 15:19:13,Twitter for iPhone,3,10
Great work from Ambassador O’Brien making the case about 5G security threats to our allies.

These licenses will come at a real cost to our national security. Access to Microsoft software for example will make Huawei’s consumer devices more attractive.

When patients have access to more data they make better informed and more cost-effective healthcare decisions.

Sadly unsurprising to see the Chinese government denying my friend Andrew Hastie a visa. The CCP's goal is to invite self-censorship in foreign capitals by punishing its critics.

As we shift the majority of our defense resources to deterring China &amp; Russia we must also continue to relentlessly pursue extremists who want to destroy our way of life.,2019-10-27 14:34:01,Twitter for iPhone,2,14

I hope @EsperDoD clarifies this statement which seems to suggest that the US government was anticipating a massive ISIS prison break as US troops withdrew. Were these risks communicated to the President? https://t.co/oee07xdsvR,2019-10-23 02:03:32,Twitter for iPhone,8,22
ICYMI: Earlier today I spoke with @mitchellreports about the latest news out of Syria. Security in the Middle East rests on the shoulders of American credibility and as we discussed the best way to ensure peace is to project strength and raise costs for would-be aggressors. https://t.co/PJWZapGz6N,2019-10-22 23:11:47,Twitter Media Studio,11,53

Great to see such a big turnout for the "Flight of Champions" Honor Flight this weekend.

This is an underappreciated aspect of the current disaster and one that is likely to echo beyond the region. Just as Putin was emboldened to invade Crimea following the Obama admin’s red line fiasco I am concerned would-be aggressors will look at Syria and see an opportunity.,2019-10-21 15:48:52,Twitter Web App,1,7
Erdogan’s lack of concern over crossing an American redline creates even more of an issue for our credibility and deterrence. If history is any guide we should expect to see further aggression from bad actors such as Iran who seek to test our limits.,2019-10-21 15:48:52,Twitter Web App,1,9
The actions taken by Erdogan after receiving the President’s letter only raise further concerns about the collapse of our deterrence credibility. Instead of taking American threats seriously Erdogan threw the letter in the trash and proceeded with his gruesome operation. https://t.co/KUGXf675Qk,2019-10-21 15:48:52,Twitter Web App,2,12

I'm saddened to hear of the passing of Rep. Elijah Cummings. He was a giant in the House of Representatives and it was an honor to serve with him on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. My thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends.,2019-10-17 15:31:12,Twitter Web App,9,55
This all boils down to the credibility of American deterrence. When deterrence breaks down conflict is more likely and we lose the ability to dictate the terms of engagement.,2019-10-17 15:09:36,Twitter Web App,33,134
If however Erdogan was not bluffing we have even bigger problems because it would mean would-be aggressors do not fear American retaliation. Ask yourself: would Erdogan have felt comfortable risking the lives of 50 Russian service members?,2019-10-17 15:09:35,Twitter Web App,27,96
In other words the presence of American service members has successfully helped deter the Turks from taking this kind of action in the past. It’s unclear why this would have suddenly changed and it suggests that ultimately Erdogan was bluffing.,2019-10-17 15:09:35,Twitter Web App,20,82
I’m looking forward to hearing from @EsperDoD today because what we’ve been told so far doesn’t make a lot of sense. Erdogan has been threatening to invade Syria for years now and I’m not sure why we acquiesced after he allegedly gave 48-hours notice.,2019-10-17 15:09:35,Twitter Web App,87,217

Great discussion with the @ReaganInstitute podcast. As we face growing threats from the CCP there's a lot we can learn from Reagan particularly when it comes to the art of ideological warfare.

In April my colleagues and I signed a letter asking HHS to take actions that support value-based care and lower healthcare costs. Happy to see the Administration do just that by reforming Anti-Kickback Statute and Stark Law. https://t.co/JJFuLJ88ow,2019-10-10 13:26:28,Twitter for iPhone,1,9
The CCP wants to dictate the parameters of acceptable speech worldwide. As Americans we have an obligation to stand tall in defense of our values. Read my bipartisan letter to the @NBA with @SenSasse @RepMalinowski @AOC @SenTomCotton and colleagues.  https://t.co/GBzoUX4kGp,2019-10-09 21:59:50,Twitter for iPhone,749,1034
We're seeing this play out before our very eyes. And things will only become more difficult as the CCP further uses market access to coerce companies to echo the Party line. If we fail to stand up for our values now we will only have ourselves to blame later.,2019-10-08 20:02:50,Twitter Web App,17,59
According to the CCP “Western people believe that their laws should play the dominant role in friction between China and the West even in China...they believe their laws are universal.” But as we’ve seen the reverse is true. The CCP seeks to censor all speech everywhere.,2019-10-08 20:02:50,Twitter Web App,20,62
In just one example when a German student studying in China made a documentary about human rights abuses Chinese state media was quick to point out “If...a Chinese student studying in Germany the Chinese people would accept he must obey German law.” https://t.co/xhs8DhfhyW,2019-10-08 20:02:50,Twitter Web App,9,40
As I wrote the “CCP’s political interference operations—intended to subvert and corrupt key Western institutions—are the least studied most subtle and perhaps most important” forms of its aggression. The Party seeks to de-legitimize western institutions like free speech.,2019-10-08 20:02:50,Twitter Web App,13,58
In light of what's transpired between China and the @NBA re-upping my article about the sources of CCP conduct which highlights the CCP's roots as an influence organization and explains how they are central to understanding the CCP today. https://t.co/otx7yDkmNy,2019-10-08 20:02:49,Twitter Web App,860,928
In order to play moneyball in the Middle East we have to work through local allies. The Kurds have proven themselves to be just that in the fight against ISIS. Abandoning them to the increasingly unstable Erdogan undermines our credibility and national security interests.,2019-10-07 20:27:51,Twitter Web App,27,122
Interesting to see the @NBA release a sanitized statement to its US audience while fully parroting CCP talking points on Weibo. So much for its “global social responsibility program that builds on the NBA’s mission of addressing important social issues.”  https://t.co/7F4q4drkCY,2019-10-07 13:32:52,Twitter Web App,29,71
Daryl Morey is right. We have an obligation to stand with Hong Kong and hold the CCP accountable for its gross violations of human rights. His willingness to speak the truth is a great embodiment of the @NBA’s global social responsibility campaign. https://t.co/eAdpxCpPJi,2019-10-06 20:04:51,Twitter for iPhone,1998,3073

@hughhewitt As I wrote in @TWQgw the lack of progress on a 355 ship Navy is just the latest sign that not everyone in the Pentagon is serious about the shift to deterrence by denial.

Even better it emphasizes the importance of ground-based long-range fires to facilitate sea denial and sea control: “We must possess the ability to turn maritime spaces into barriers so we can attack an adversary’s sea lines of communication while defending our own.”,2019-07-18 16:29:21,Twitter Web Client,3,3
Most prominently the CPG prioritizes III MEF as its “main focus-of-effort” and will provide INDOPACOM and 7th Fleet with a “capability to persist inside an adversary’s weapon systems threat range create a mutually contested space and facilitate the larger naval campaign.”,2019-07-18 16:29:20,Twitter Web Client,2,5
It’s no secret that I’ve been critical about DoD’s implementation of the National Defense Strategy. I wrote about this at length in @TWQgw.

Preserving the freedoms that remain in Hong Kong is a test for the free world.

There are a host of options stronger than sanctions but less escalatory than attacking SAM sites and killing 150 Iranians.

While I’m disappointed we came up short I’m glad we demonstrated bipartisan support for intermediate range missiles and had a lively debate in the process.

This is a great example of how the CCP tries to shape external coverage and perceptions. The Chinese government knows @BethanyAllenEbr would hold it accountable for human rights abuses and is trying to pressure AFP into sending a less tenacious reporter. https://t.co/ajaMomuyA4,2019-06-19 16:53:51,Twitter Web Client,12,19

Great look at my amendment to restore R&amp;D funding for intermediate range missiles. The current defense bill not only unilaterally ties us to an agreement no other country complies with but goes beyond treaty obligations to cut R&amp;D funding.

Withdrawing from the INF Treaty is key to restoring a favorable balance of power in Asia.

The Budget Committee is marking up a bill today that would raise budget caps for the next two years and dedicate $733B for defense in FY2020.

From Poland to the Baltics and beyond many of the countries considering Huawei for their 5G networks are US allies that could be on the frontlines of a future conflict.

Why do we have a Congress?,2019-02-15 01:51:25,Twitter Web Client,9,78
1. It'll likely get tied up in the courts;   2. They didn’t like it when Obama did everything through Executive fiat;  3.

Conservatives celebrating the emergency declaration should pause and consider the following:,2019-02-15 01:50:54,Twitter Web Client,4,32

Like I've said before until we change the way Congress operates we’ll be right back where we started: satisfying the literal definition of insanity by doing the same things and expecting different results.

Addressing these cyber vulnerabilities will be neither cheap nor easy which is why today’s @TransportGOP hearing on infrastructure investment was so critical.

Lesson #3 is simple: Problems don’t age well.   That’s true in life and particularly true in politics. We can’t punt the problem of border security to the next generation. So let’s work together over these next two weeks with a sense of urgency to fix it.,2019-02-05 22:54:06,Twitter Web Client,1,13

It's no surprise when this process results in a hurried vote on a bill that we had no opportunity to amend.   We should instead work from the ground up starting with the relevant committees &amp; ordinary members. This will increase the likelihood of achieving long-lasting policies.,2019-02-05 22:53:32,Twitter Web Client,0,2
Lesson #2: A top-down approach to policy problems does not work.  It seems we routinely let the President and the most powerful members of Congress negotiate in secret while the rest of us wait for white smoke to emerge from the White House chimney.,2019-02-05 22:53:08,Twitter Web Client,0,5
In other words the debate over border security is the best kind of debate to have. It’s not about irreconcilable abstract principles. It’s about specific requirements that we can measure in terms of geography human resources and cost.,2019-02-05 22:52:42,Twitter Web Client,0,3
Perhaps Democrats disagree with this proposal. But assuming everyone agrees on the long-term goal of gaining 100 percent operational control of the border then the only question is: how do we do it more effectively? What is the right mix of barriers technology and people?,2019-02-05 22:52:24,Twitter Web Client,0,3
Lesson #1: There's massive miscommunication on border security that must be cleared up.  Despite what you may have heard the White House is not asking for 1 gigantic concrete wall running coast to coast.

US security increasingly depends upon command of the seas. It is not a birthright and is being challenged by China and Russia every day. This is not a 30-year out problem. This is a here and now problem. The Navy the nation needs is the biggest one it can possibly build—now.,2019-02-02 17:11:46,Twitter for iPhone,7,19

Given that the NDS prioritizes the CCP threat and the first island chain is the heart of the competition abandoning a 355 ship Navy would undermine the entire premise of the NDS and deterrence by denial. https://t.co/AIgpRoWlZV,2019-02-02 14:31:55,Twitter for iPhone,6,27
