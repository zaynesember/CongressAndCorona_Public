In advancing these bills @WaysMeansCmte moves forward one of the biggest positive changes to #Medicare in a generation.

Today @WaysMeansCmte Dems are pushing to expand hearing dental and vision coverage under #Medicare. Just look at how these bills would positively affect those in the First District of MA. https://t.co/d37zVQIQYY,2019-10-22 15:01:00,Twitter Media Studio,8,27
Bottom line: you shouldn’t have to choose between paying your monthly bills and paying for your prescription drugs. We must #LowerDrugCosts now. @WaysMeansCmte is working on this TODAY. Watch here: https://t.co/8ufaybEm6E https://t.co/uWRhNF7wUf,2019-10-22 13:28:00,Twitter Media Studio,6,11

The #LowerDrugCostsNow Act would allow the US govt to negotiate lower drug prices for American consumers based on international pricing.

We must continue the fight to #LowerDrugCosts because American families should not have to choose between paying the bills or paying for medicine. Here's a recap of how @WaysMeansCmte has been addressing this important issue.    https://t.co/3PJP4VTZzR,2019-09-24 14:24:53,Twitter Web App,6,20
Proud to partner with @SpeakerPelosi on this bill to #LowerDrugCosts. People make unthinkable sacrifices just to afford medications they need to stay alive &amp; that shouldn't be the case.

Today’s hearing is a very somber one but also a very important one.  Hate is becoming mainstream in this country and that must end. I want to thank @repjohnlewis for holding this hearing.  You have spent your life working to eradicate hate and I sincerely thank you for that.,2019-09-19 14:11:24,Twitter Web App,98,440
Our Tax Code is also no place for hate.  Groups that propagate white supremacy anti-Semitism and hatred for the LGBTQ community among others do not deserve a government subsidy through tax exemption.  Hate is not charitable and it is not educational.,2019-09-19 14:09:48,Twitter Web App,12,36
We need to lead by example and that requires us not only to reject but to condemn outright hate in all of its forms.  Racism misogyny xenophobia—they have no place here.  America is no place for hate.,2019-09-19 14:09:30,Twitter Web App,10,20

Finally we held a hearing on paid family &amp; medical leave. We discussed how the US is the only industrialized nation that does not guarantee access to it.

@WaysMeansCmte The #SECUREAct goes a long way in addressing this problem by making it easier for Americans to save.

@WaysMeansCmte In addition we were able to expand the Earned Income Tax Credit #EITC to single filers and passed legislation to increase the Child Tax Credit #CTC &amp; the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit #CDCTC.

Thank you to Rita Lewis for sharing the story of her late husband Butch Lewis who my bill is named in honor of. He drove a truck for 40 years &amp; died a few years ago of a massive stroke.

I continue to believe that AG Barr should respect the wishes of the American people &amp; Congress and release the full report &amp; supporting evidence found in Mueller’s probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election.
