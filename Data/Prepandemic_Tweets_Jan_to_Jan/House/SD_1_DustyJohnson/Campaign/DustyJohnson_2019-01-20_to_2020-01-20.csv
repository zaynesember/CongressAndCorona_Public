@DustysPinkTie @RepDustyJohnson The last week I‘ve wished twitter had a greater variety of response buttons. Everything @DustysPinkTie posts is funny but oddly disturbing. I don’t feel like I should “heart” them but some type of recognition seems warranted.,2019-12-07 02:48:20,Twitter for iPhone,0,9

@LisaKaczke Lisa please don’t call this “my tie.” I don’t really wear it.   Given the drama @DustysPinkTie stirs up it’s no wonder it’s been out of the rotation for months.,2019-11-21 21:38:31,Twitter for iPhone,0,6

“[Black US House Republican Will] Hurd said Reps.

Only 1% of AOC’s donations came from within her district.  Dusty (with 94%) was at other end of the spectrum:  “Leading the freshman class in receiving the greatest share of itemized contributions from their constituents was [GOP] Rep. Dusty Johnson.”  https://t.co/yz8zd5Fjvp,2019-08-14 03:26:35,Twitter for iPhone,11,43
