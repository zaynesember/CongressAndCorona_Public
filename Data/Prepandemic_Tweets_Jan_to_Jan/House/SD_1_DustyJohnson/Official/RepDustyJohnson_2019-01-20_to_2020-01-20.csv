ICYMI: Today is #NationalAgDay! This week I highlighted the importance of market access to #SouthDakota as the 10th largest #ag exporting state.

#HR1 would strip power from the states and essentially federalize our nation’s elections. Washington D.C. has enough problems there’s no need to hand over more of the state’s authority to D.C. bureaucrats.,2019-03-08 17:17:18,Twitter Web Client,1,14
#HR1 is full of flaws but what’s most startling is the billions of #taxpayer dollars that would go towards political campaigns. The American people should not be forced to foot the bill for TV political ads of candidates they don’t agree with.,2019-03-08 17:17:18,Twitter Web Client,3,20
It’s disappointing Congress has to pass another resolution to condemn bigotry in the first place &amp; it’s even more disappointing that it took Democrats nearly a week to negotiate language to condemn insensitive &amp; racist comments.
