This list of cities that will reach a $15/hour minimum wage in 2020 shows the power of the #FightFor15 movement.   While progress continues to be made too many Americans are still being left behind.  In 2020 I will keep fighting for a $15/hour federal minimum wage. https://t.co/y0U6xuKH6D,2020-01-10 23:16:00,TweetDeck,47,129
.@mattgaetz showed courage &amp; independence in voting for the War Powers Resolution. We have strong differences on issues including the legality of the Soleimani killing but no one should question his sincerity about preventing endless wars &amp; military interventionism.,2020-01-10 22:17:08,Twitter for iPhone,61,509
Yesterday the House used the power of the purse to prevent Trump from starting another Middle East war.  Averting reckless war is not a partisan cause — it's a humanitarian one.  The Senate must follow suit by passing the War Powers Resolution. https://t.co/czVmVrnenT,2020-01-10 21:23:00,TweetDeck,69,248
Voting rights restored in 2019:  ➡️ New Jersey: 80000+  ➡️ Kentucky: 140000+  ➡️ Nevada: 77000 ➡️ Louisiana: ~40000   This is only the beginning.   In 2020 we will keep fighting to end felony disenfranchisement across America.,2020-01-10 19:12:00,TweetDeck,298,1272
As more than 200 members of Congress — mostly Republicans — sign a letter urging the Supreme Court to reconsider Roe v. Wade here’s a reminder that abortion rights aren’t the partisan issue that many conservatives would have you believe.  Most Americans are in support. https://t.co/loWvow14OO,2020-01-10 17:22:00,TweetDeck,77,183

Iowa is now the only state with a lifetime voting ban for all formerly incarcerated people without the governor's individual approval — leaving 52000 Iowans unable to vote.    Every 2020 candidate should demand an end to felony disenfranchisement in Iowa. https://t.co/CC6FgM125Y,2020-01-10 02:19:00,TweetDeck,481,1596
Basic healthcare education and electricity should be available for all.  That means passing Medicare for All pushing for public ownership of utilities like PG&amp;E and investing in public education instead of for-profit charter schools.,2020-01-10 00:17:00,TweetDeck,199,563
Republicans want to claim that their policies have increased prosperity for every American but ordinary people know the truth when they see their paychecks.   To create an economy for all we must expand the EITC strengthen unions and make sure every worker earns a living wage. https://t.co/h8wOJ2cECe,2020-01-09 22:36:00,TweetDeck,55,118
Acres burned in wildfires over the past two years:   🔥 California (2018): 2M 🔥 Amazon (2019): 2.2M 🔥 Siberia (2019): 6.7M 🔥 Australia (2019): 12M  How many acres have to burn before we finally put the health of our planet and future generations over special interests?,2020-01-09 20:19:00,TweetDeck,826,2214
Here it is. After years of legal challenges on the state-level Republicans are now revealing their long-term goal:   Overturning Roe v. Wade even though most Americans support reproductive rights.   We won't let them rollback women’s reproductive rights. https://t.co/Zu4jVy7TT4,2020-01-09 18:16:00,TweetDeck,83,241
Wildfires burned 12M acres in Australia in 2019 and half a billion animals died — the hottest and driest year in the nation's history.   Entire species could have been lost.  With climate change destroying ecosystems we can’t wait any longer on action.  https://t.co/3wSjG11ym9,2020-01-09 16:27:00,TweetDeck,227,677
@jimbojones2011 @alexkotch @Sludge As explained in article I have zero investments in Fossil Fuels. The investments are from my wife’s separate wealth prior to marriage and we file taxes separately. @alexkotch article is very fair.,2020-01-09 15:39:50,Twitter for iPhone,1,7
This endorsement for @BernieSanders is a very big deal. Thanks for your leadership @VarshPrakash &amp; @evanlweber.

My heart is with all those in Puerto Rico after they suffered their worst earthquake in the last hundred years.  We failed the island in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria and we can’t fail them now.  Our fellow Americans deserve a just recovery. https://t.co/JWL1c8OpoT,2020-01-09 02:44:00,TweetDeck,220,653
The American people will come together tomorrow at 5pm local time in cities and towns in every corner of this nation to demand that we aren’t driven into another costly Middle East war.   Find a #NoWarWithIran protest happening near you: https://t.co/Tms7lG2xB1,2020-01-09 01:02:00,TweetDeck,140,271
Is Congress listening to the majority of Americans who don’t want to repeat the mistakes of the Iraq War?   RT if you agree that Congress should stop funding any offensive military action against Iran. #NoWarWithIran,2020-01-08 23:13:29,TweetDeck,1508,2102
