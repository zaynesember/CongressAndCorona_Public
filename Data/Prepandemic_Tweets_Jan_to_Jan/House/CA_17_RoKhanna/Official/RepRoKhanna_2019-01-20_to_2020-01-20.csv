2019: Enbrel is one year away from losing patent protection + market monopoly so execs don't pursue potential breakthrough Alzheimer's prevention.  Meanwhile 500000 new patients are diagnosed with Alzheimer's each year costing our country $290 billion.,2019-06-05 16:04:13,Twitter for iPhone,41,115
Enbrel is a case study in Big Pharma's greed:  1998: Enbrel is approved to treat arthritis so Pfizer and Amgen charge up to $5000 for one package.

Big Pharma says outrageous prices are necessary to fund R+D. But when they discovered that Enbrel might prevent Alzheimer's they buried the research because clinical trials would cost $80 million.

Productive meeting with @ActingSecDef Shanahan on bringing peace and humanitarian aid to Yemen improved collaboration between Silicon Valley and the Department of Defense and continuing diplomacy with North Korea. https://t.co/BK3iiMNq6S,2019-03-25 23:53:00,TweetDeck,1,9
Mueller spent two years and wasn’t able to draw a conclusion on charges of obstruction against the president- to say that AG Barr was able to in 2 days just isn’t believable. https://t.co/w9nGrC3xtC,2019-03-25 22:56:00,Twitter Media Studio,30,123
The past few days have been a harrowing test for the nation’s ongoing gun violence crisis. @MattxRed continues to be an incredible source of inspiration and hope #EnoughisEnough https://t.co/lXazFcpFoQ,2019-03-25 20:43:11,Twitter Web Client,8,53
Mueller did not exonerate the president on charges of obstruction of justice. My sense is that he intended for Congress to make that determination. https://t.co/cN3PtIHtFb,2019-03-25 14:28:05,Twitter Media Studio,22,99
We still can’t ignore that there was an interference in our election - apart from the question of whether Trump conspired is the question of what we can do to make sure that never happens again. https://t.co/P4tYKCHdBR,2019-03-25 00:41:44,Twitter for iPhone,22,115
Renewable energy a critical component of the #GreenNewDeal is already powering our economy. It’s on us to bring up that number until we are entirely zero-emission. https://t.co/u7Lp7Z03Tu,2019-03-24 23:10:00,TweetDeck,4,36
This memo doesn’t change what the American people have deserved all along:  For the Mueller report in its entirety to be made public.,2019-03-24 20:34:39,Twitter for iPhone,41,203
Those with the least means available to pay should not be on the hook for the highest rent costs - that’s counterproductive to them to neighborhoods + to the economy. Excited to join @dillonliam and @mlevinreports on @CAHousingPod this week to discuss! https://t.co/OsKg9m1WDG,2019-03-24 20:09:00,TweetDeck,16,38
The president’s facts are just wrong on China - he knocks the #GreenNewDeal but really we have a green energy race with China. https://t.co/HlLYkVQUGF,2019-03-24 16:12:54,Twitter for iPhone,30,93
Lethal airstrikes have tripled during the Trump administration with little to no transparency to follow. Congressional oversight though required by the constitution is almost wholly absent. https://t.co/BQb3HgPakw,2019-03-24 16:10:00,TweetDeck,30,49
Excellent State of the City speech from Fremont Mayor Lily Mei. A close friend and partner in tackling the Bay Area’s toughest problems always a pleasure to listen to another leading voice for change. https://t.co/uZaNxKOlI0,2019-03-23 21:44:00,TweetDeck,3,13

We still have 80+ vacant ambassador posts and senior foreign policy leadership positions. With an administration so focused on militarism over peace and diplomacy we are wholly ill-equipped to pursue any meaningful agenda abroad https://t.co/WQoFSqLjO8,2019-03-23 17:10:49,Twitter for iPhone,12,34
Constituent services form the core of our work in Congress and #TeamKhanna offers nothing but the best. We were selected as one of the top 4 in the House/Senate out of 535 offices. Proud to be named a finalist! https://t.co/nCnLe519MK,2019-03-23 16:40:00,TweetDeck,16,89

There is no room here for selective editing or political favors - the entire Mueller report must be made fully available to the American people. That’s transparency that’s oversight and that’s justice.,2019-03-22 21:59:34,Twitter for iPhone,33,185
I told @andersoncooper that we need to have a readout of what Trump and Putin discuss. Even Republicans in Congress were appalled when Trump sided with Putin over our own intelligence agencies. https://t.co/tajRszAq3b,2019-03-22 20:51:00,Twitter Media Studio,9,36
Incredible conversation with the @alzassociation this morning.  16 million Americans provide unpaid care to patients with Alzheimer’s/other forms of dementia. The emotional physical and financial costs of this disease are far too high. https://t.co/HiUcFnNAkg,2019-03-22 19:48:39,TweetDeck,12,57

Screenshots of WhatsApp messages with a brutal autocrat to serve as official White House records?

I grew up believing that a well-rounded education should include lessons about citizenship and civics. Our country desperately needs the next generation to learn about the constitution and lowering the voting age would be a huge part of making that happen. https://t.co/aHLuUS9q5l,2019-03-20 17:50:00,Twitter Media Studio,27,114

This is an important step by @facebook to prevent advertisers from discriminating when displaying job housing and credit ads to users.
