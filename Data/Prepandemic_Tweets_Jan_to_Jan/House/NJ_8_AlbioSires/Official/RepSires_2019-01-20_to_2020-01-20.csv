H.R. 6 doesn’t allow any of these people to “cut the line” and receive their citizenship on some sort of fast track the process would take years. It simply rectifies a horrible mistake within our broken immigration system that left so many people in an uncertain state.,2019-06-28 17:35:17,Twitter Web Client,1,2

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) offers nutrition assistance to about 43 million families each year and kept 8.4 million people out of poverty in 2015 alone. In New Jersey that year there were over 900000 people receiving benefits.,2019-06-21 19:20:25,Twitter Web Client,0,3
During the ongoing appropriations process I signed letters requesting funding for these programs among others. Because I know the real impact they can make on people’s everyday lives.,2019-06-21 19:16:44,Twitter Web Client,0,3
I have been and remain a vigilant supporter of programs such as SNAP CHIP SSI and the Child Care &amp; Development Block Grant.,2019-06-21 19:16:32,Twitter Web Client,0,3
Furthermore the Administration also wants to impose harsher work requirements for people who seek benefits. This would lower the amount of people eligible for benefits and is a cruel form of discrimination against those who are disabled and unable to work.,2019-06-21 19:13:06,Twitter Web Client,0,2
The White House also wants to implement an $8.6 billion spending cut to the Department of Housing and Urban Development. This would decrease available funds for grants and programs that help people afford housing.,2019-06-21 19:10:16,Twitter Web Client,0,2
If the Administration does change the measurement data 300000 children and 150000 seniors would lose their health coverage from Medicaid. This is without the President’s proposed $1.5 trillion cut from Medicaid which would cause even more people to lose their health coverage.,2019-06-21 19:06:37,Twitter Web Client,0,2
The current measurement of poverty in the U.S. uses the Consumer Price Index but this Administration wants to switch to an alternative measure of inflation that would decrease the amount of people eligible for certain programs such as Medicaid and SNAP.,2019-06-21 19:03:24,Twitter Web Client,0,2
In 2017 the 8th District had a poverty rate of 15.5% and 22.5% of children were living in poverty. However the Trump Administration wants to build more barriers and make it more difficult for families and individuals to sign up for and receive benefits.,2019-06-21 19:00:46,Twitter Web Client,0,3
Therefore there are millions more Americans who are struggling to make ends meet but are not categorized as under the poverty line meaning they cannot receive benefits from the federal government which in turn punishes them financially.,2019-06-21 18:56:54,Twitter Web Client,0,5
This number does not consider the current reality for a family that may be enduring hardships but doesn’t fall below the official poverty line. The National Center for Children in Poverty estimates a family requires an income of twice the poverty level to support their needs.,2019-06-21 18:53:59,Twitter Web Client,0,5
Unfortunately almost 40 million Americans about 12% of the population fall below the poverty line. Even more frustrating is the realization that nearly 1 in 5 children under the age of 18 live in poverty.,2019-06-21 18:53:28,Twitter Web Client,2,12

Thank you for joining me for this #FridayFocus to discuss how the appropriations process works and the importance of the process to our democratic system.,2019-06-14 18:49:29,Twitter Web Client,1,4
The appropriations process is an important aspect of Congress’s Constitutional power of the purse. Funding levels determined during the appropriations process are crucial to the performance of agencies and implementation of public programs.,2019-06-14 18:46:25,Twitter Web Client,1,2
Upon both chambers adopting an identical spending bill the bill is then sent to the President for his signature or veto.,2019-06-14 18:42:54,Twitter Web Client,1,2
Both chambers must pass an identical bill before it can be signed into law. If there are differences the chambers can then continue to pass amendments to each other until issues are resolved or can hold a conference of members in order to get an agreement.,2019-06-14 18:37:28,Twitter Web Client,1,2
Once the spending bill passes the House it is sent to the Senate for consideration. The Senate can also make changes to the bill in the form of amendments. These amendments usually become the topic of debate between the two chambers.,2019-06-14 18:31:20,Twitter Web Client,1,2
When a minibus like this comes to the House Floor members are given the chance to offer amendments and change funding levels of the bill before it receives a vote.,2019-06-14 18:27:38,Twitter Web Client,1,2
The debate this week centered on a minibus a package of 4 smaller appropriations bills. This minibus H.R. 2740 considered spending limits for Labor Health and Human Services Education Defense State and Foreign Operations and Energy and Water Development.,2019-06-14 18:24:20,Twitter Web Client,1,2
Following passage in the Appropriations Committee the spending bills will be brought to the House floor for a vote. The spending packages can be voted on individually all-together or in smaller groupings known as a “minibus”.,2019-06-14 18:21:04,Twitter Web Client,1,2
Each subcommittee will then mark up their spending proposal before sending it to the full committee for consideration.,2019-06-14 18:18:15,Twitter Web Client,1,2
Next each subcommittee will create a budget that allocates their total predetermined funding to the programs and agencies under their jurisdiction. This power of Congress to determine spending levels is vital for enforcing checks and balances.,2019-06-14 18:15:12,Twitter Web Client,1,2
Some of the letters I signed supported funding for medical research affordable housing programs community health centers community development grants law enforcement grants and gun violence prevention measures.,2019-06-14 18:12:09,Twitter Web Client,1,2

We must keep fighting #UntilEveryFamilyIsReunited. That is why I’m proud to support the Keep Families Together Act which would prohibit #FamilySeparation at the border.,2019-05-07 15:39:15,Twitter Web Client,4,10

These priorities are the first step of a long process that I'll be engaged in and with your input during future #FridayFocus events. The reauthorization is an opportunity for us to lay the groundwork for a transportation system that America can be proud of.,2019-05-03 18:59:02,Twitter Web Client,0,0
My sixth priority is to encourage transportation policies that support green vehicle technologies. This is the technology of the future - American companies are leading the charge on R&amp;D and we have to facilitate the installation of green vehicle infrastructure on our roads.,2019-05-03 18:54:19,Twitter Web Client,0,1
My fifth priority is to have Congress anticipate new transportation technologies. Automated vehicles are already on our roads and the technology will only become more available over the next few years. We have to craft policies that rule how this new tech operates on roads.,2019-05-03 18:49:11,Twitter Web Client,0,0
My fourth priority priority is about our workers - we have to make sure that supplies and labor for projects paid for by taxpayers are sourced by America. Our country has a ready-pool of supplies and labor that we will engage when it's time to build our projects.,2019-05-03 18:43:57,Twitter Web Client,0,0
My third priority is to help connect communities that are growing and developing and which were once cut off from access to econ. zones. If we want everyone to enjoy from a booming economy we have to give our cities access to economic areas.,2019-05-03 18:37:57,Twitter Web Client,0,2
But if we can do it right it will be worth the effort. @Amtrak @NJTRANSIT and other national/regional passenger rail companies could use our help. I think offering them a hand is a good idea.,2019-05-03 18:30:35,Twitter Web Client,0,3
My 2nd priority is passenger rail bc so much depends on passenger rail running smoothly. Success means fewer cars on the road less congestion &amp; decrease in carbon emissions. There are cars to be upgraded track to be replaced stations to be refurbished. All a big investment.,2019-05-03 18:24:54,Twitter Web Client,1,5
My first priority is straightforward: having our bridges repaired. The most recent @ARTBA Bridge Report said that there are over 47k "structurally deficient" bridges around the country. NJ itself has over 500 deficient bridges. There's no excuse for this. We HAVE to fix it.,2019-05-03 18:19:32,Twitter Web Client,1,5
On Tuesday I sent the Committee a list of my priorities for this review and I want to share those with you today.

My statement: https://t.co/BbD6eeXLRD,2019-03-31 17:47:57,Twitter for iPhone,2,2
Let’s not forget how we got here: Maduro has blocked aid for more than five years while the Venezuelan people starve. His time is up. We must work with even greater urgency toward a peaceful democratic transition. #Venezuelalibre,2019-03-31 17:47:56,Twitter for iPhone,3,5
Glad to see that @ICRC will be able to deliver aid inside #Venezuela - this would not have been possible without pressure from Interim President @jguaido and the international community.,2019-03-31 17:47:55,Twitter for iPhone,3,4
President Trump shows no interest in doing the work to protect the Southern Border and instead spends his time disparaging the vulnerable. Cutting aid to Central America is a cruel political stunt that will only escalate problems. My statement: https://t.co/uhh5fJ4WC0,2019-03-30 17:04:30,Twitter for iPhone,5,6
Thank you for joining this #FridayFocus on the President’s budget and how Congress starts its appropriations process.  Stay tuned for future updates as we continue crafting legislation that will fund the government in fiscal year 2020.,2019-03-29 21:00:11,Twitter Web Client,0,4
Congress holds the power of the purse and it is important that we craft a thoughtful budget that takes into account the needs of Americans – not just the desires of the President.,2019-03-29 20:52:00,Twitter Web Client,0,4
As we continue on the appropriations process I’ll be sharing more info about the programs I support and why.,2019-03-29 20:52:00,Twitter Web Client,0,4
To name just a few – I’m supporting funding for medical research affordable housing programs Community  Development Block Grants community health centers law enforcement grants and gun violence prevention measures.,2019-03-29 20:46:03,Twitter Web Client,2,6
I’ve signed letters supporting numerous programs that make a real difference in communities across the country.,2019-03-29 20:46:03,Twitter Web Client,0,4
Deadlines are set for when these letters of support are then sent to one of the 12 subcommittees with specific jurisdiction over these programs where they are reviewed by appropriators and used to create a final budget resolution.,2019-03-29 20:46:03,Twitter Web Client,0,3
These letters outline recommended funding levels for programs important to our constituents.,2019-03-29 20:43:24,Twitter Web Client,0,3
This is where the appropriations process comes in.  Congress appropriates funding to different departments and each member can circulate and sign letters of support for programs agencies or priorities.,2019-03-29 20:43:24,Twitter Web Client,0,3
As I mentioned along with oversight we also play a role in the crafting of a budget resolution and the eventual bills that set funding levels for the next fiscal year.,2019-03-29 20:39:04,Twitter Web Client,0,3
It is important that we have the opportunity to hear from these officials because although the Executive Branch does not have the power of the purse they are in charge of overseeing the execution of the programs that Congress funds and it is important to get their insight.,2019-03-29 20:39:04,Twitter Web Client,0,3
As a newly appointed member of the @budgetdems it is now my responsibility to question officials on funding levels and the Committee has had three administration members come in to discuss the sharp cuts to numerous non-defense programs.,2019-03-29 20:24:03,Twitter Web Client,1,4
The Committee will convene regularly to receive updates on the direction of our government’s spending and how our annual budget can best reflect the priorities of our nation.,2019-03-29 20:19:37,Twitter Web Client,1,3
One of the Committee’s main responsibilities is to carry out oversight on budget proposals that are presented to Congress.,2019-03-29 20:19:37,Twitter Web Client,0,1
The Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 created the Budget Committee to allow Congress to develop a self-governing group of members to analyze the President’s budget proposal and unite it with congressional plans.,2019-03-29 20:14:34,Twitter Web Client,0,2
It’s important to note though that these are just suggestions. The budget is what the president *wants* programs/agencies/departments to be funded at – Congress reviews the wish list and changes it to reflect *its* own priorities.,2019-03-29 20:14:34,Twitter Web Client,0,2
So for example if a president thinks affordable housing or the Special Olympics are good positive things that the government should get behind his budget proposal will include funding for the departments that oversee those programs.,2019-03-29 20:08:55,Twitter Web Client,1,3
So each year the President sends his proposed budget – what he would ideally like Congress to do – for members of Congress to review.   A budget is like a statement of principles – a president’s budget will mirror a president's values.,2019-03-29 20:08:55,Twitter Web Client,1,3
Everything from the Department of Defense to the National Institutes of Health fall under the Executive Branch and each year funding levels must be set. However the President does not have the power of the purse – the Constitution explicitly gives that authority to Congress.,2019-03-29 20:03:55,Twitter Web Client,1,3
The President’s budget is a (very large) document outlining the Administration’s policy priorities and how they ought to be funded. The document itself is very large because the Executive Branch oversees massive government agencies.,2019-03-29 20:03:55,Twitter Web Client,1,3
Overall the federal budget process is straightforward: in the spring the president proposes a budget Congress reviews that budget and then Congress tries to agree on a final budget resolution.,2019-03-29 19:58:46,Twitter Web Client,1,3
On March 11 2019 the President released his budget proposal for the next fiscal year.  This budget goes to Congress and is available to the public as a statement of the administration’s priorities.  For today’s #FridayFocus let’s look at how the budget process actually works.,2019-03-29 19:54:54,Twitter Web Client,4,10
This bill would reauthorize and boost funding for the Health Center Program for the next five years &amp; increases funding for the National Health Service Corps.,2019-03-28 20:28:45,Twitter Web Client,1,2
I #valueCHCs which is why I joined @WhipClyburn as an original cosponsor of HR 1943 the Community Health Center &amp; Primary Care Workforce Expansion Act of 2019. https://t.co/05qKxi3yJG,2019-03-28 20:28:44,Twitter Web Client,1,4
I condemn the Administration’s decision to eliminate funding for Special Olympics education programs. It is unfair to the thousands of youth who participate in these unique programs. My statement: https://t.co/JgMnz2lVlN,2019-03-28 18:44:37,Twitter Web Client,3,2
We discussed the President’s safety Maduro’s continued persecution of her husband as well as humanitarian aid to the Venezuelan people. See my full statement: https://t.co/PmEv012DcM,2019-03-27 20:58:26,Twitter Web Client,15,15
Today I sat down with First Lady of #Venezuela @FabiiRosales and @AsambleaVE along with @RepMcCaul @RepShalala @RepDWStweets @DebbieforFL and @MarioDB to hear first-hand what is happening with interim President @jguaido. https://t.co/Ag2Erb7xzQ,2019-03-27 20:58:25,Twitter Web Client,108,160

I also would like to thank all the countries that have been working to help #Vz and let us know how we can Help.,2019-03-27 18:47:21,Twitter Web Client,1,4
I asked @SecPompeo about the need to engage in Latin America and the importance of standing with the Venezuelan people holding the #Maduro regime accountable the current migration crisis that is destabilizing #Vz.,2019-03-27 18:47:20,Twitter Web Client,1,3
Today @HouseForeign held its annual budget hearing with @SecPompeo. The #TrumpBudget would cut over $12 billion from funding to @StateDept and @USAID gutting our capabilities to ensure a safer and stronger world. https://t.co/5ALIaVDPJZ,2019-03-27 18:47:19,Twitter Web Client,8,6
Earlier I met with @PHMSA_DOT to discuss the work the agency has been doing in #NJ &amp; around the country. https://t.co/IZkGXnDODA,2019-03-27 18:00:46,Twitter Web Client,0,0

The public deserves to know the conclusions of Special Counsel Mueller’s report. We serve the American people and I will continue to strive for transparency in government. https://t.co/cBtLMuK127,2019-03-22 23:33:34,Twitter for iPhone,3,11
Today was our first #FridayFocus and you’ll be seeing more as we take time on Fridays to take a closer look at specific issues and legislation we’re working on in Congress. Let us know if there’s something you would like explained in a future #FridayFocus,2019-03-22 20:46:32,Twitter for iPhone,0,1
As a member of the House T&amp;I Committee and Budget Committee I’ll work to get our States the money they need. Politics shouldn’t get in the way of keeping commuters safe and keeping our economy strong. No matter your party infrastructure failures are bad for everyone.,2019-03-22 20:46:13,Twitter for iPhone,0,0
Thanks for joining us today as we looked at the projects in need of funding along the Corridor. Follow our boss as we fight to help the 8th District and the nation better. We’ll keep looking at other infra priorities in the region. Sires staff signing off!,2019-03-22 20:45:40,Twitter for iPhone,0,0
Today’s tour from DC to NYC highlighted once again that rail infrastructure is key to transporting people and goods. It is only a piece of the puzzle that keeps our nation’s transportation systems running smoothly but if one piece is missing the whole thing suffers.,2019-03-22 20:41:26,Twitter for iPhone,0,1
Today was just a brief overview of the NEC’s infrastructure struggle. Old bridges and tunnels don’t get fixed by themselves and states need federal help to finance these upgrades.,2019-03-22 20:40:19,Twitter for iPhone,0,1
Specifically if one of the 2 tunnels fail rail capacity on this route between NYC and NJ would drop by 75%. That would cripple the economy the housing market and job prospects in the region. This doomsday scenario would take years if not decades to recover from.,2019-03-22 20:39:32,Twitter for iPhone,0,1
The Gateway Project would repair New Jersey and New York’s share of this infra. It would take some time and be expensive but it’s worth it. If this any part of this infrastructure fails in Jersey or in Maryland or anywhere else along the Corridor it’d be bad for all of us.,2019-03-22 20:38:53,Twitter for iPhone,0,1
Here’s a close up look at the state of these 100+ year old tunnels. https://t.co/0lNGFttmiw,2019-03-22 20:37:08,Twitter for iPhone,1,1
Again though decades of nonstop use will degrade anything and Superstorm Sandy made things worse. I’m 2012 the storm flooded these tunnels and the saltwater did some terrible damage.,2019-03-22 20:19:47,Twitter for iPhone,0,0
So you have an idea of how important it is — the tunnel hosts 450 trains each day carrying about 200k commuters between Newark and Manhattan. Basically this is the busiest rail corridor in the Western Hemisphere.,2019-03-22 20:19:25,Twitter for iPhone,0,0
We all know about the Hudson tunnel and it’s challenges. It’s bad enough that this is another piece of infrastructure that’s over a century old but this also happens to be *the* linchpin of the NE Corridor.,2019-03-22 20:18:48,Twitter for iPhone,0,1
The Portal Bridge is over a century old and is used by over 400 trains each day. It is a major source of delays and there are frequent electrical and mechanical issues. A clear sign that repair/replacement is long overdue. https://t.co/hBpaafxhkD,2019-03-22 16:52:03,Twitter for iPhone,1,4
The Gateway Project is the plan to address a lot of these problems and is broken into a series of smaller goals including work on the Portal North Bridge and the Hudson Tunnels.,2019-03-22 16:43:40,Twitter for iPhone,1,2
Unfortunately as we’ve shown throughout the morning a lot of the infrastructure supporting the movement of millions is in desperate need of repair and replacement.,2019-03-22 16:38:28,Twitter for iPhone,1,2
Staffers here - we’re arriving in the 8th District! Not only is this area home to some of the best people we have the pleasure of working for - Rep. Sires’ constituents - it is also home to one of the biggest transportation hubs in the nation. https://t.co/xtmBLMsaBV,2019-03-22 16:37:07,Twitter for iPhone,1,4
I’m also joining other colleagues’ appropriations efforts to raise funding for transpo infrastructure grants. This is a national necessity.,2019-03-22 16:20:06,Twitter for iPhone,1,2
I’m asking for $500m above the President’s request and for fair distribution of grant funding for public transpo projects. If that sounds like a lot that’s because it is. But we can’t keep limping along with patchwork bills and erratic funding levels.,2019-03-22 16:19:47,Twitter for iPhone,2,3
And during the yearly appropriations process I get involved in requests for federal infrastructure program funding. This year I’m leading a letter to increase funding for BUILD grants which are available for large infra projects that States can’t handle on their own.,2019-03-22 16:17:49,Twitter for iPhone,1,2
Here’s the bill: https://t.co/NjRsKr7TkT https://t.co/mFewMH0g7T,2019-03-22 16:17:05,Twitter for iPhone,2,3
During the regular legislative season I propose &amp; debate transpo infra bills. For example the House unanimously passed one of my rail safety oversight bills in Feb. It’s a step in the right direction and shows that there’s strong bipartisan support for rail safety legislation,2019-03-22 16:14:09,Twitter for iPhone,1,2
I’m a member of @TransportDems which means I’m involved in most transportation infrastructure debates in Congress. I take that responsibility seriously.,2019-03-22 16:09:52,Twitter for iPhone,1,1
My staffers have entered the great state of New Jersey! As a member of the @TransportDems and the only NJ member on @HouseBudgetDems part of my responsibilities are carrying out oversight on the budget and pushing for federal funding for important infrastructure projects. https://t.co/s53ZNfGCeZ,2019-03-22 15:54:10,Twitter for iPhone,2,5
The sad thing is that these old bridges and tunnels aren’t an exception. They’re *all around the country*. New Jersey is home to two very important and very old pieces transit infrastructure that are in serious need of repair.,2019-03-22 14:42:56,Twitter for iPhone,1,4
Here’s the Susquehanna River bridge in Maryland another piece of over 100 year old infrastructure (it opened in 1906). Just to give you an idea of how old this bridge is it’s about as old as human flight (1903). https://t.co/DgIZhu4Q0C,2019-03-22 14:42:17,Twitter for iPhone,2,2
Here’s a look at the tunnel which is broken into 3 sections and is suffering from constant water leaks and maintenance challenges. https://t.co/VGVIyLWPYP,2019-03-22 14:19:25,Twitter for iPhone,2,2
First example: the Baltimore &amp; Potomac tunnel. It’s literally 19th century infrastructure (built in 1873) and one of the linchpins of the NE Corridor. 1 of every 4 Amtrak trains make their way through it.,2019-03-22 14:08:32,Twitter for iPhone,3,3
It’s old infrastructure though. Decades of nonstop use will degrade anything — and if one section of the track goes down it affects every rider from Washington DC to Boston.,2019-03-22 14:07:32,Twitter for iPhone,3,4
The Northeast Corridor hosts millions of riders every year in our country’s economic powerhouse region. That’s why it’s so important for Congress to invest in transportation infrastructure funding.,2019-03-22 14:05:43,Twitter for iPhone,4,11
Sires staff here - we’ve departed DC and are en route to the 8th District and NYC. Here is a view of the tracks that millions of commuters and Amtrak riders use every year. https://t.co/JXqNAkHjdO,2019-03-22 14:04:51,Twitter for iPhone,3,7
We desperately need federal funding to repair our crumbling infrastructure but the President’s budget proposal cuts key programs that are used to shore up our rail lines bridges and tunnels.,2019-03-22 13:51:53,Twitter for iPhone,7,9
Today I sent members of my staff to join other NJ and NY offices on an infrastructure tour of parts of the Northeast Corridor. Follow along as they look at our nation’s infrastructure needs - including the Gateway Project.,2019-03-22 13:49:59,Twitter for iPhone,6,23

Congress took decisive action by rebuking the President’s national emergency declaration in a resolution which the President just vetoed.

This morning I voted in favor of #HConRes24. The Special Counsel's report must be made public when the investigation comes to an end. The American people deserve transparency to ensure that our government can be trusted by the American people.,2019-03-14 15:39:00,Twitter Web Client,4,4

I was completely unsatisfied by the answers to all of these questions.  I believe the Trump Administration is playing an extremely dangerous game with the economy and the well-being of Americans across the country by not examining the consequences of their budget plan.,2019-03-12 20:14:43,Twitter Web Client,1,1
Finally I asked if @realDonaldTrump had a plan to address increased homelessness that could result from his steep cuts to affordable housing specifically if there was any plan to ensure that veterans were not forced onto the streets.,2019-03-12 20:08:22,Twitter Web Client,2,0
I also asked if the President had consulted any mayors when he decided to eliminate the Community Development Block Grant program.  I know firsthand how useful CDBG funding can be and I think it is ridiculous that the President tries again and again to scrap the program.,2019-03-12 20:03:32,Twitter Web Client,2,2
I used my five minutes to ask if the administration would use its costly tax plan to cut Medicare Medicaid and Social Security funding in the future.  This year’s proposal slashes future spending and I was not satisfied by Director Vought’s answer.,2019-03-12 19:56:34,Twitter Web Client,1,1
