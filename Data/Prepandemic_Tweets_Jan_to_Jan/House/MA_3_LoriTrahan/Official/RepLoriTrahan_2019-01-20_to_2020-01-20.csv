41 Democrats &amp; 31 Republicans traveled to Israel to deepen our understanding of the US-Israeli relationship.   Every Member of Congress should have the opportunity to see these complexities for themselves.

This afternoon I spent time with @BostonJCRC to discuss my recent trip to #Israel — what I saw what our group learned and how it will inform my work in Congress and on @HASCDemocrats. https://t.co/RZoklO5ThD,2019-09-05 20:52:41,Twitter for iPhone,4,17
The President’s decision to circumvent the authority of Congress to fulfill a politically-charged campaign promise is a disservice not only to our men and women in uniform but to the intent of the Constitution.,2019-09-05 20:10:41,Twitter Web App,5,14

Diverting urgently-needed funding away from military construction projects that Congress has already authorized in order to build an ineffective wasteful wall that won’t make our country any safer or our immigration system any less broken is a deeply flawed and reckless policy. https://t.co/4uT4H3Belf,2019-09-05 20:09:01,Twitter Web App,23,50

The fact remains: the Senate could save lives by passing common sense gun safety legislation that the House has already approved. I urge them to do so quickly. https://t.co/LXRUlQtevo,2019-09-03 20:13:37,Twitter Web App,15,47
It was women in #Lawrence who helped lead the “Bread and Roses” strike for safer working conditions and a fair wage. As we continue to fight to #Raisethewage I continue to find inspiration from these trailblazing women. #MA3   https://t.co/7N4WU3CtxF,2019-09-03 19:54:33,Twitter Web App,2,13

The overtime rule was last updated FIFTEEN YEARS ago. Workers should not have to keep waiting to see their hard work reflected in their paychecks. That’s why I’m a co-sponsor of the Restoring Overtime Pay Act. #LaborDay #FixOvertime,2019-09-02 15:00:00,TweetDeck,16,49
As the daughter of a union ironworker I know first hand the important role that labor plays in advancing the well-being of hardworking families across the US.

Labor #Unions are the backbone of the middle class. I’m proud of our region’s role in that and I’m proud to be unapologetically pro-union.

It’s been 15 years since the overtime rule was last updated and it’s costing workers billions every year. I support the Restoring Overtime Pay Act because American workers have waited too long to receive fair compensation for the long hours they worked. #FixOvertime #LaborDay,2019-09-01 18:00:00,TweetDeck,3,12

America is tired of this senseless violence. My heart goes out to the victims of this latest mass shooting in Texas. This carnage is preventable. The American people expect Congress to act.
