These girls are our future leaders and yesterday’s event was a great reminder that when women empower women we’re better for it.,2020-01-19 22:06:01,Twitter for iPhone,8,71
Seeing a woman run and win inspired her to run for 4th grade class president. And I can’t tell you how much it means to me to have young girls running for their class office because they see so many women leading in their government.,2020-01-19 22:06:01,Twitter for iPhone,6,72
This type of representation really does matter. I told a story about Addie the daughter of one of our great volunteers. Addie came with her mom to events and to knock on doors and had the chance to watch our team go from a start up campaign to actually governing in Washington.,2020-01-19 22:06:00,Twitter for iPhone,3,19
Yesterday I was proud to speak in Lansing for the fourth annual Women’s March. In 2018 women played an outsized role in flipping our district and we elected a female Governor female Secretary of State and female Attorney General. https://t.co/w7BXr5G58X,2020-01-19 22:06:00,Twitter for iPhone,56,596
We have SIX upcoming events across the district where we’ll hit the streets and talk to voters about what our campaign is all about. No experience necessary!

With super PACs spending over $1 million on ads against me and the Trump family tweeting about us I'd deeply appreciate your help to make sure we end the year strong. Can you make a contribution to make sure we're ready to fight in 2020? https://t.co/Wtcd659K4W,2019-12-20 22:50:45,Twitter Web App,77,232
There are some decisions in life that have to be made based on what you know in your bones is right. And this is one of those times. https://t.co/1FN17ZnABw,2019-12-17 01:22:11,Twitter Web App,4338,26478
Fun night talking 2020 strategy at our winter field kickoff in Rochester Hills. It was great to see friends from the last campaign and plenty of new faces too. We won’t be able to do this without you all so thank you for coming! https://t.co/rgpD9SVLTo,2019-12-09 02:33:04,Twitter Web App,30,256
Want to be a part of the campaign? We need to collect 2000 signatures by April 21 to make sure I’m back on the ballot. This is a fun and easy way to get involved in the community!

It took us an extra day to get all 21 of us to Florida but we're finally sitting down to dinner with the Moore side of the family.  To all of you who have supported our campaign in so many ways we're so thankful!   From our family to yours Happy Thanksgiving! https://t.co/S2QhFAfiKP,2019-11-29 23:52:20,Twitter Web App,13,200
Was glad to sit down with @camanpour to discuss why working by with and through coalition partners matters &amp; why it helps protect American lives.  Global threats require a global response. That’s why I introduced a resolution to affirm our support for the counter-ISIS coalition: https://t.co/esebGI8jux,2019-11-18 17:23:17,Twitter for iPhone,23,122
28 degrees and sunny turned out to be great game day weather - even if the game was a bit messy. MSU won the first quarter though! As always GO GREEN!🏈 https://t.co/mbAinEEe25,2019-11-16 22:05:29,Twitter Web App,14,208
Not cool @nbcsnl. Leaving the U.P. off a map is like calling pop “soda” or driving a car on Mackinac. Or eating pizza without ranch. It’s just plain wrong.  The fine people of our Upper Peninsula have long been neglected by lazy cartography—and I think you owe them an apology. https://t.co/1MKWL2UWlj,2019-10-14 22:47:21,Twitter for iPhone,40,315
I’m proud to serve alongside @JoeCunninghamSC. The @NRCC’s attack on his family is a new low in our politics –– and exactly why we need leaders like Joe who model the civility and integrity we need now more than ever in Washington. I hope you’ll support him: https://t.co/5kuxByFBoo,2019-09-28 20:41:04,Twitter Web App,37,209
Couldn’t be more proud to serve alongside these women –– especially this week.  We came to Congress shaped by our backgrounds in national security with a clear mandate from our constituents –– to work across the aisle to get things done and to always put country over party. https://t.co/Sr5kp40VKi,2019-09-28 17:44:21,Twitter Web App,87,494
I swore an oath to protect and defend the Constitution. If true these new allegations against the President are a threat to our national security and constitute an impeachable offense. https://t.co/oCkAuT94O7,2019-09-24 02:14:57,Twitter for iPhone,827,3407
I'm ready to pass smart and effective means to secure our border. But the Administration's decision to divert money from our military to fulfill a campaign promise politicizes the Pentagon –– which is harmful to our service members and the future of our military. https://t.co/dXZNwsWgXP,2019-09-07 20:43:09,Twitter Media Studio,52,229
This #LaborDay we take time to acknowledge the work of the labor movement and America’s working people.   I spent the morning marching with @OE_324 in downtown Detroit — who operate a world-class equipment training facility in #MI08. It was a privilege to march along side them. https://t.co/r1LqxUrNGg,2019-09-03 01:19:56,Twitter for iPhone,15,94
Michigan is a must-win state. But to do well here candidates need to get serious about responding to the issues we’re facing in our state: https://t.co/Ci5XS51s3P #DemDebate,2019-07-30 16:33:24,Twitter Web App,41,172

Had a great time marching with supporters in Clarkston’s 4th of July parade this morning. Happy Independence Day to all!   Now onto my other favorite holiday traditions: jumping in the pool and eating hot dogs! 🌭🇺🇸 https://t.co/oGTmAjE5Iy,2019-07-04 21:01:40,Twitter for iPhone,17,115

We have evolved as a nation to agree that no one should go broke because they happen to get sick or have a pre-existing condition.  Great to join @Morning_Joe to talk about what we're doing to lower prescription drug &amp; healthcare costs including the bill we’re voting on today: https://t.co/krERfB9JmW,2019-05-16 21:08:45,Twitter Media Studio,27,114

To quote my fellow House Armed Services Committee member @HoulahanForPa we’re about country not party.

It is possible to recognize good work — and common ground — while staunchly supporting Democratic candidates around the country.,2019-01-26 00:39:09,Twitter for iPhone,26,271
Criticizing VP @JoeBiden for complimenting Rep. Fred Upton feels like a product of our polarized times. We should recognize someone when they do something good — especially when it is supporting funding for cancer research which should transcend party politics. https://t.co/4qykljUJhZ,2019-01-26 00:39:09,Twitter for iPhone,48,329
