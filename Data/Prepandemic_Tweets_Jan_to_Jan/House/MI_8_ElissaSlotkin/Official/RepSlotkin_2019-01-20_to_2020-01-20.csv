Thank you @GovWhitmer for standing up for decency in our politics. https://t.co/HtkWLNNA9c,2020-01-17 23:42:47,Twitter Web App,52,241
Just this week I participated in a Homeland Security hearing entitled “Confronting the Rise in Anti-Semitic Domestic Terrorism.” This will continue to be a focus of mine in the weeks ahead—as these incidents are not only wrong they impact the sense of safety in our communities.,2020-01-17 18:42:41,Twitter Web App,11,49
The good news is that the community responded immediately to condemn the attacks and I commend our local law enforcement and members of the Livingston County community who are calling out this hate for what it is and investigating where it came from.,2020-01-17 18:42:41,Twitter Web App,7,40
In recent months we have seen an uptick in anti-Semitism both in Michigan including at MSU Hillel and across the country — and it is deeply disappointing to see this hateful behavior show up here in our own community. https://t.co/08fstmkPKr,2020-01-17 18:42:41,Twitter Web App,29,75
The House passed #HR3 to allow the government to negotiate for lower prices.  My Real Time Benefits Act which would lower out-of-pocket costs passed w/ unanimous bipartisan support.  The Senate must take the up or down vote we owe constituents demanding action to lower costs.,2020-01-16 22:39:35,Twitter Web App,14,63
Pharmaceutical companies have already hiked up the price of hundreds of drugs this year by an average of 5%.  Drug prices have increased to the point where Michiganders sometimes pay more for their medication than their mortgage — and that’s got to stop. https://t.co/JGHBfE7wBa,2020-01-16 22:39:35,Twitter Web App,33,103
The resolution passed both the House and the Senate and while the President vetoed it he nonetheless instructed the military to end refueling support for Saudi Arabia’s activity in Yemen.  He responded to the joint resolution and made important changes to U.S. military policy.,2020-01-15 14:27:08,Twitter Web App,8,51
It’s important to remember that when the joint resolution passes both chambers it will go to the President.  While he may choose to veto it the case of the Yemen joint resolution last year is instructive:,2020-01-15 14:27:07,Twitter Web App,8,46
I’m proud that key provisions of my House bill which passed with bipartisan support last week were incorporated into S.J.Res 68 and that the combined text now has the support of 51 Senators on both sides of the aisle.,2020-01-15 14:27:07,Twitter Web App,10,44
Yesterday I met with Senator @timkaine and I’m glad to partner with him to move the War Powers Resolution over the finish line.,2020-01-15 14:27:07,Twitter Web App,50,358
This image is Islamophobic period.   Leadership climate is set from the top &amp; when the President elevates bigoted false imagery that targets &amp; demeans the Muslim community it's not only wrong — it sets an example that makes those communities less safe. https://t.co/OHKsIQiZEp,2020-01-14 14:58:19,Twitter Web App,183,623
This bill does a great deal to address the threat of PFAS contamination –– and my amendment will hold federal agencies accountable for finding viable and effective alternatives to PFAS-containing products such as firefighter foam to prevent further contamination.,2020-01-12 22:38:07,Twitter Web App,18,111
Communities across Michigan are confronting PFAS contamination in their water. Last summer I toured Livingston County’s Chain of Lakes where PFAS build-up is visible in plain sight  I was proud my amendment passed as part of the PFAS Action Act which passed the House on Friday https://t.co/L0Oktd2ns0,2020-01-12 22:37:59,Twitter Media Studio,91,389
Good news: the House just passed a major PFAS bill to prevent these harmful chemicals from contaminating our communities in Michigan – and our bill to require PFAS testing in drinking water has officially become law: https://t.co/tYo8V4UmqI,2020-01-11 00:13:55,Twitter Media Studio,127,725
If our loved ones are going to be sent to fight in any protracted war the president owes the American public a conversation.   This resolution allows us to start the debate as our founders intended.,2020-01-10 01:50:43,Twitter Web App,149,759
For me this is not a theoretical exercise:   My husband spent 30 years in the Army and retired as a Colonel; my stepdaughter is a brand-new Army officer; and my son-in-law's unit is stationed at Al-Asad Air Base which was targeted by ballistic missiles this week.,2020-01-10 01:50:43,Twitter Web App,187,875
The War Powers Resolution we passed today states the President must consult Congress before going to war with Iran — this is simply what our Constitution requires and I’m pleased that this bill earned support from both Republicans and Democrats. https://t.co/k6flnWu8fU,2020-01-10 01:49:26,Twitter Media Studio,450,1853
Today we're voting on a resolution I introduced to make it clear that if the President wants to take us to war he must get authorization from Congress.  If our loved ones are going to fight in any protracted war the President owes the American people a public conversation: https://t.co/zBFzU6wHMd,2020-01-09 17:43:01,Twitter Media Studio,449,1636
We owe it to our military –– and to ourselves as a nation –– to provide our troops clarity and to abide by the Constitution that they have sworn their lives to protect.,2020-01-09 00:39:45,Twitter Web App,49,270
As an Army wife with a step-daughter &amp; son-in-law currently on active duty I feel strongly that Congress has long abdicated its responsibility as laid out in the Constitution to make the hard decisions we owe our troops and our country when it comes to authorizing  war.,2020-01-09 00:39:45,Twitter Web App,55,300
We have been at war for nearly two decades and in that time which has spanned both Republican and Democratic administrations Congress has voted only twice to authorize the use of military force: first in 2001 and then in 2002.,2020-01-09 00:39:45,Twitter Web App,14,118
But his behavior does not mean that the Administration can disregard the Constitution by engaging in a wider war without consulting first with Congress.  I felt it was important that Congress put down that marker.,2020-01-09 00:39:44,Twitter Web App,18,135
I have watched friends and colleagues get hurt or killed by Iranian rockets mortars and explosive devices. And Qasim Soleimani was the architect of some of the worst destabilizing activities in the Middle East.,2020-01-09 00:39:44,Twitter Web App,10,108
The United States always retains the right to self-defense.   As a former Shia militia CIA analyst who has served multiple times in Iraq I have lived Iran's destabilizing activity in Iraq up close and personal.,2020-01-09 00:39:44,Twitter Web App,14,120
This resolution is intended to have that debate as our Founders intended &amp; to be clear with the public on whether their body has authorized war with Iran.  Members of Congress have a constitutional responsibility to uphold when it comes to authorizing the use of military force.,2020-01-09 00:39:44,Twitter Web App,18,134
If our loved ones are going to be sent to fight in any protracted war the President owes the American people a public conversation about why and for what ends.,2020-01-09 00:39:43,Twitter Web App,19,154
The resolution I introduced today is intended to make clear that if the President wants to take us to war he must get authorization from Congress.  This is simply what our Constitution requires. https://t.co/SkFFr9HRQV,2020-01-09 00:39:43,Twitter Web App,583,2487
The President and his team should remember the gravity of their responsibilities and be prepared to explain their strategic plan –– to include next steps and possible ways to de-escalate.   They owe the American public no less.,2020-01-08 03:11:05,Twitter Web App,69,427
While we don't yet know the full extent of tonight's military activity if it's indeed true that Iranians fired conventional ballistic missiles at U.S. targets it would be unprecedented.  We are now in a cycle of escalation that threatens to draw us into wider war.,2020-01-08 03:11:04,Twitter Web App,33,231
There is nothing that prepares you for the sound of incoming fire.   Tonight I'm watching the coverage and thinking of our service members and diplomats who are in harm's way and about their families back at home worried about them.,2020-01-08 03:11:04,Twitter Web App,147,1281
If we do indeed get officially asked to leave Iraq we will need robust diplomacy to outline a plan with the Iraqi government that maximizes pressure on ISIS and allows us time to safely withdraw in a way that doesn’t cost the U.S. in blood and treasure.,2020-01-06 18:58:26,Twitter Web App,112,636
That is why he invested so heavily in the Shia militia groups in Iraq that he would teach to target U.S. forces. Ironically his death may achieve precisely what he set out to do in life.,2020-01-06 18:58:25,Twitter Web App,77,432
Soleimani was the architect of a strategy going back to 2004 that was built on the idea that if U.S. forces were attacked in Iraq the casualties would eventually force the United States to withdraw.,2020-01-06 18:58:25,Twitter Web App,69,349
A freer hand to continue to expand the capabilities of the Shia militias and Iran’s placement of ballistic missiles in Iraq which can project violence into places like Saudi Arabia and Israel. This last issue could be a game changer.,2020-01-06 18:58:25,Twitter Web App,73,380
If the United States is kicked out it gives the Iranian government a freer hand in Iraq. That’s a freer hand to exert influence on Iraqi decision-making.,2020-01-06 18:58:25,Twitter Web App,83,424
The second reason to stay is ironically the same reason the President chose to go after Qasim Soleimani: to counterbalance Iran’s destabilizing influence in the Middle East.,2020-01-06 18:58:25,Twitter Web App,77,407
After U.S. forces withdrew from Iraq in 2011 it took ISIS only two short years to gain power. Mosul and Raqqa the two ISIS power centers in their self-proclaimed caliphate were finally liberated in 2017.,2020-01-06 18:58:24,Twitter Web App,80,387
Why this matters: First and foremost our presence in Iraq helps ensure that ISIS doesn't regenerate and regain the ability to threaten the United States Europe and the Middle East.,2020-01-06 18:58:24,Twitter Web App,93,452
That said I expect the issue will be taken up by the Iraqi Cabinet this week with the real possibility that the PM will follow through and formally ask for the removal of U.S. forces.,2020-01-06 18:58:24,Twitter Web App,73,359
This agreement allowed us to send roughly 5000 forces to support counter-ISIS operations and train the Iraqi military. While Sunday’s vote in Baghdad gave the PM political cover to kick us out it was neither necessary nor binding.,2020-01-06 18:58:24,Twitter Web App,70,375
In 2014 the U.S. and Iraq quickly negotiated the terms of U.S. force presence through an Exchange of Letters which remains the only agreement on the books that authorizes U.S. military personnel in Iraq. I represented the Pentagon in those negotiations.,2020-01-06 18:58:24,Twitter Web App,91,458
At the time after the U.S. had withdrawn forces from Iraq in 2011 the United States had no uniformed military presence performing independent military missions in Iraq – only a very large embassy carrying out regular diplomacy.,2020-01-06 18:58:24,Twitter Web App,67,353
It was immediately clear that ISIS was dangerous well-funded and had global reach that could (and soon would) organize and inspire attacks in the West.,2020-01-06 18:58:23,Twitter Web App,65,362
A bit of context: In 2014 when ISIS took over large swaths of Iraq (and Syria) the desperate government of Iraq formally asked for U.S. military help fighting ISIS.,2020-01-06 18:58:23,Twitter Web App,78,394
The question many Americans are likely asking now: Why does it matter if we are kicked out of Iraq? I certainly understand why many would question why we’d want to stay given the blood and treasure we have invested in that part of the world.,2020-01-06 18:58:23,Twitter Web App,78,419
As I watched the Iraqi parliament respond Sunday to the killing of Qasim Soleimani by passing a resolution rejecting U.S. military presence in Iraq I had some thoughts on the implications.,2020-01-06 18:58:23,Twitter Web App,741,1988
Congress also has a deep interest in the future of our relationship with Iraq given our investment of blood and treasure there to rid the region of ISIS.  Congress needs to understand the Administration’s plan as soon as possible.,2020-01-03 15:59:47,Twitter Web App,2556,17804
This Admin. like all others has the right to act in self-defense. But the Administration must come to Congress immediately and consult.  If military engagement is going to be protracted — which any informed assessment would consider — the Administration must request an AUMF.,2020-01-03 15:59:47,Twitter Web App,2435,13945
It is critical that the Administration has thought out the moves and counter-moves this attack will precipitate and is prepared to protect our diplomats service members and citizens serving overseas.,2020-01-03 15:59:47,Twitter Web App,1745,11038
Against our diplomats and service members or high-ranking military officers against our allies and partners in the region or through targeted attacks in the Western world.,2020-01-03 15:59:47,Twitter Web App,1446,8876
The two administrations I worked for both determined that the ultimate ends didn’t justify the means. The Trump Administration has made a different calculation.  The Iranian government has vowed to retaliate and avenge Soleimani’s death and could do so in any number of ways:,2020-01-03 15:59:46,Twitter Web App,2601,11512
What always kept both Democratic and Republican presidents from targeting Soleimani himself was the simple question:   Was the strike worth the likely retaliation and the potential to pull us into protracted conflict?,2020-01-03 15:59:46,Twitter Web App,3458,15214
We watched as his power increased and he brought strength and capability to groups in Iraq Syria Lebanon and Yemen and to smaller cells around the Middle East and the world with devastating consequences.,2020-01-03 15:59:46,Twitter Web App,1071,7498
I watched friends and colleagues get hurt or killed by Iranian rockets mortars and explosive devices that were provided to Iraqi proxies and used against U.S. forces under Soleimani’s guidance.,2020-01-03 15:59:46,Twitter Web App,1201,8227
If you worked on the Middle East over the past 20 years you dealt with the growing organization and sophistication of Soleimani’s covert and overt military activities which have contributed to significant destabilization across the region.,2020-01-03 15:59:46,Twitter Web App,1428,9127
As a former Shia militia analyst who served multiple tours in Iraq and worked at the White House under both Presidents Bush and Obama and later at the Pentagon I participated in countless conversations on how to respond to Qassem Soleimani’s violent campaigns across the region.,2020-01-03 15:59:45,Twitter Web App,14716,41939

In short the Trump Administration must be judicious as it develops options and not let fast-moving events draw us into a wider conflict that threatens lives.,2019-12-31 19:47:02,Twitter Web App,30,194
In the short term American lives are at risk. In the long-term we must not break our strategic relationship with the government of Iraq in a way that cedes Iraq to Iranian influence or throws away the hard-fought gains we have made beating back ISIS.,2019-12-31 19:47:01,Twitter Web App,27,162
That said this is a moment for careful diplomacy. Our diplomats and service members in Iraq deserve a thoughtful reasoned strategy to help de-escalate the situation.,2019-12-31 19:47:01,Twitter Web App,25,183
The subsequent rocket attacks last week on a U.S. military location in Kirkuk which killed a U.S. contractor and wounded several U.S. service members demonstrate Iran's continued interest in using Iraqi proxies to attack the United States and further its regional objectives.,2019-12-31 19:47:01,Twitter Web App,15,72
During the HASC congressional delegation to Iraq last month we warned the government of Iraq about growing Iranian influence and that the placement of Iranian ballistic missiles in Iraq in particular ran counter to ongoing U.S support to train and equip the Iraqi military.,2019-12-31 19:47:01,Twitter Web App,13,65
The Iranian government has long sought political influence over the Iraqis with the goal of using Iraq's territory to move people materiel and weapons across the Middle East.,2019-12-31 19:47:01,Twitter Web App,12,59
As a former Shia militia CIA analyst who has served multiple times in Iraq I have seen Iran's destabilizing activity in Iraq up close and personal.,2019-12-31 19:47:00,Twitter Web App,12,71
No matter the politics the government of Iraq has a responsibility to provide for the security of all foreign embassies on their soil. The government of Iraq must live up to those responsibilities.,2019-12-31 19:47:00,Twitter Web App,9,80

The most common issue Michiganders raise with me isn't one ripped from the headlines—it's the one dominating our kitchen-table conversations: the price of prescription drugs.

Today we passed landmark legislation that would drive down the cost of prescription drugs by allowing our government to negotiate for the very best prices.  For the over 800000 Michiganders with diabetes #HR3 could bring down the price of insulin to as little as $400 a year. https://t.co/J6h4lLxM8v,2019-12-13 01:56:19,Twitter Media Studio,194,763

I was inspired by Boston’s resiliency and am reminded today of the strength we find in community even in tragedy.,2019-04-15 22:25:02,Twitter for iPhone,4,50
Thinking of the victims of the #BostonMarathon today and their families. Six years ago I remember cheering on my stepdaughter Christine — and watching as a festive day turned into a heartbreaking attack on the city and on our country.,2019-04-15 22:25:00,Twitter for iPhone,5,67
That hate has real-world consequences as we have recently seen in places like New Zealand.  Leadership should be about bringing people together not splitting us apart. And no one — not even someone who has offended others — deserves to be targeted in such a manner.,2019-04-13 19:33:47,Twitter for iPhone,24,129
It seems like every week I’m commenting on either anti-Semitic or Islamaphobic comments from senior leaders in DC. While I don’t always agree with Rep.

Our national conversation about sexual harassment is long overdue.

Michigan’s Chaldean community is strong — its members are our neighbors friends and family.

Detaining over a thousand Iraqi nationals residing in the U.S. including numerous Chaldean Christians and other religious and ethnic minorities who face religious persecution in Iraq and deporting them violates our norms and morals as a country. https://t.co/E9lANlxAI1,2019-04-08 13:28:28,Twitter Web Client,22,65
Unfortunately I must once again condemn anti-Semitic statements that claim that Jews in the U.S. have dual loyalty to Israel. This anti-Semitic trope has both terrible historic roots and is deeply offensive today. Enough. https://t.co/eGvcP7JO2v,2019-04-07 16:46:23,Twitter for iPhone,95,372

Lost in the back &amp; forth on the Mueller report summary is what it confirms: Russia sought to interfere in our elections particularly through social media ads.

As wages stagnate and families feel more and more squeezed by rising costs we should be looking for every opportunity to ease the burden — that's why I voted for the #PaycheckFairnessAct which helps close gender and racial pay gaps. #EqualPayDay,2019-04-02 21:13:57,Twitter for iPhone,7,51
Equal pay shouldn't be a partisan issue — it's an economic issue.

Proud to stand alongside incredible #MI08 activists like @amandathomashow in recognizing #SAAM.

Any qualified individual willing to risk their life to defend our country should be allowed to do so and treated with the dignity and respect worthy of their sacrifice.

This week two Congressional Republicans invoked Hitler and Nazism to attack Democrats. Quoting Mein Kampf's anti-Semitic slurs on the House floor as Rep.

My mom passed away in 2011 of ovarian cancer after struggling to afford health insurance for years due to her pre-existing condition.  The Administration's efforts to strike down the entire ACA would take us back to that time––when people like my mom weren't able to access care. https://t.co/sdyXwjYjtq,2019-03-27 20:40:12,Twitter Media Studio,69,145
Special Olympics provides outstanding educational opportunities for those with intellectual disabilities and helps reduce the stigma and isolation they too often experience.

As we review the investigation’s findings I believe both Congress and the American people should be able to read the report for themselves.

Our democratic system is one of compromise and I have deep concerns about the President’s decision to break with historical precedent and bypass that system and wield a national emergency declaration as a tool to make good on a political promise.,2019-02-15 13:02:20,Twitter for iPhone,10,89
Effective leadership on tough issues doesn’t come through coercion it comes through influence. Both sides came together in support of a deal that funds billions in border security including additional technology and physical barriers along the border.,2019-02-15 13:02:20,Twitter for iPhone,13,72
I will continue through my work on the PFAS Task Force to push the EPA to ensure the safety and security of our water supply and of our communities.,2019-02-14 22:47:48,Twitter Web Client,7,41
Michigan families cannot continue to drink water laden with toxic chemicals. While today’s EPA announcement is a start it doesn’t go nearly far enough fast enough. We need quick decisive action to address this public health crisis. https://t.co/p88lymm8EX,2019-02-14 22:47:48,Twitter Web Client,19,37
I have devoted my career to combatting terrorism and have seen firsthand these violent acts’ impact and I send my deepest condolences to the victims’ families.,2019-02-14 22:24:59,Twitter for iPhone,14,85

This important legislation would provide 60 days of partial paid leave for those who need time away from work to care for a new child or a sick loved one. No one should have to choose between putting food on the table and being there for the people who need them most.,2019-02-13 00:45:41,Twitter Web Client,28,123
When my mother was diagnosed with ovarian cancer I had to use sick leave in order to come back to Michigan and care for her. So I am very proud to be an original co-sponsor of the #FAMILYAct.,2019-02-13 00:45:41,Twitter Web Client,39,220
Sadly Michigan weather prevented me and 70 of my fellow Congressmen &amp; women from attending John Dingell’s funeral today. I am terribly sorry to not have been able to join my friend @RepDebDingell on such an important day but we will attend the service in DC later this week.,2019-02-12 17:41:52,Twitter Web Client,17,152

Today I offered my first amendment as a Member of Congress to the Veterans’ Access to Childcare Act. It pushes for stronger communication between the VA and DoD so that any veteran who needs to take advantage of childcare to access mental health services is able to do so. https://t.co/NYhP0oh5AN,2019-02-08 19:56:09,Twitter Web Client,30,196
His accomplishments were many and his wit was legendary and he will be sorely missed. My heart goes out to his wife @RepDebDingell and to his family.,2019-02-08 02:32:03,Twitter for iPhone,14,82
Michigan lost a truly great man today. John Dingell was an unparalleled public servant who dedicated his life to championing the needs of ordinary Americans.,2019-02-08 02:32:02,Twitter for iPhone,41,217
Sky-high drug prices are a problem that both Democrats and Republicans agree we need to solve. So it’s time for us to build on that common ground and pass legislation that will have an immediate effect on families’ pocketbooks and health.,2019-02-07 22:48:59,Twitter Web Client,8,57
This is a solvable problem. There is no reason why Medicare should be barred from negotiating for lower drug prices something the VA does already — which is why I’m excited to sign on to a bill that finally gives Medicare that power. https://t.co/bzJzIPMAiE #EndRxMonopolyPrices,2019-02-07 22:48:59,Twitter Web Client,24,96
Today the Michigan Delegation is thinking of @JohnDingell — the “Dean” of the House of Representatives — and a champion for our state in Congress. We love you! https://t.co/M55pIlv7kk,2019-02-07 21:03:34,Twitter for iPhone,8,97
My thoughts are with my friend @RepDebDingell and @JohnDingell -- two incredible public servants we're lucky to have in Michigan. They and their family are on my mind and my prayers during this difficult time. https://t.co/cL9NmTI2mx,2019-02-06 16:19:51,Twitter Web Client,6,74
These are issues where we have common ground but to deliver we must get in a room and hammer out real compromise. To aid our work we must dampen the vitriol and partisanship – not just in a speech but in the real work that comes next. #SOTU,2019-02-06 06:08:44,Twitter Web Client,4,47
I am eager to get to work on some of the issues he raised tonight such as lowering the price of prescription drugs and passing a once-in-a-generation infrastructure package. #SOTU,2019-02-06 06:08:43,Twitter Web Client,3,37
I’m always happy to hear the President call for unity and bipartisanship but I urge him to live by those words and better yet follow up with deeds. #SOTU,2019-02-06 06:08:43,Twitter Web Client,11,111

My guest @amandathomashow said it best: Our message tonight is to survivors — that you are strong and you are heard and that a new generation of leaders in Congress has your back. #SOTU https://t.co/kGjdjCXr7O,2019-02-05 23:57:15,Twitter for iPhone,49,308
Couldn’t be more proud to be joined at  #SOTU by @amandathomashow a woman who has exhibited such leadership and effected real change on an issue directly impacting our community in #MI08. https://t.co/LNFkPsC02x,2019-02-04 23:39:11,Twitter for iPhone,23,183
I urge Secretary DeVos to abandon the proposed rule changes in favor of strengthening protections for students and survivors.,2019-02-02 19:29:01,Twitter for iPhone,17,64
In particular absolving universities of legal responsibility if a survivor comes forward to school employees or athletic personnel shows at best a total disregard for what happened at MSU.,2019-02-02 19:29:01,Twitter for iPhone,6,43
The lesson from the Nassar tragedy is not to make it easier for academic institutions to avoid liability in cases of sexual assault. https://t.co/tVOp01wxcS,2019-02-02 19:29:00,Twitter for iPhone,37,133
It is a reminder that as black and brown communities continue to demand that same recognition it is our responsibility to hear them. #BlackHistoryMonth,2019-02-01 22:38:53,Twitter Web Client,4,21
#BlackHistoryMonth born out of a demand for recognition of black Americans' accomplishments and contributions to our nation is an opportunity to celebrate those who have worked in an act of service to their country to shape our society and make us who we are.,2019-02-01 22:38:53,Twitter Web Client,7,27
Under Secretary @BetsyDeVosED's proposed rule to Title IX Michigan State University would likely not have been required to take action to protect the survivors of the Larry Nassar scandal. This is inexcusable. My letter to Secretary DeVos: https://t.co/fFfOpPscBp,2019-02-01 21:13:35,Twitter Web Client,37,90
To my fellow Michiganders this bill was because of you. You asked me why the average TSA worker Customs and Border Protection employee FAA or FDA employee were punished because of something they had nothing to do with.

I urge everyone in Michigan to heed the Governor’s call exercise leadership and turn down the thermostat to 65 until noon tomorrow.

Multiple snow emergencies have been declared across #MI08 today with guidance to stay off the road given the conditions.

Now as I’ve been saying for some time Democrats &amp; Republicans need to get into a room &amp; negotiate the specifics of an enduring deal to fund the government—it’s our fundamental responsibility as Members of Congress and the people we represent are counting on us to get it done.,2019-01-26 00:49:32,Twitter for iPhone,10,66
I welcome the news that the Senate and House have voted on the President’s proposal to re-open the government — the fact that federal workers are going to get paid after 35 days without a paycheck is reason to be glad both parties have come to a consensus on a temporary deal.,2019-01-26 00:49:32,Twitter for iPhone,4,65
I’m also eager to get to work on issues affecting Michigan in particular that I believe need to be approached from a homeland security perspective -- namely the growing drinking water crisis in our state and other environmental security concerns.,2019-01-24 19:38:54,Twitter Web Client,10,59

Such a trend underscores my belief that we need to start thinking about environmental security the same way we think about homeland security -- because it’s about the health and safety of our kids and our way of life here in Michigan.,2019-01-24 00:43:49,Twitter Web Client,6,15
It seems like every other week we hear of a new PFAS discovery in our state. We need to start to look at these incidents as more than random data points: it’s a growing trend that we need to address. https://t.co/EcoBy8hz8f,2019-01-24 00:43:49,Twitter Web Client,12,46
