Today @realDonaldTrump signed a major trade deal to put our country first. Meanwhile Pelosi signed articles of impeachment that divide our country. Remember that Dems only care about pleasing their radical base while Republicans are advancing an agenda to lift all Americans up. https://t.co/dyjMkKEfvk,2020-01-16 03:17:28,TweetDeck,17,16

As @joncoupal points out in this op-ed you’re paying more at the pump while Sacramento Democrats are taking more and more of that money from road improvements and congestion relief. https://t.co/1HCwTw79Iw,2019-10-14 17:42:06,Twitter for iPhone,1,3
You've been lied to - again. Sacramento Democrats are robbing you of more money at the gas pump and now they are breaking their promise by stealing that money away from highway projects. Thanks to Democrats you pay higher taxes higher gas prices and are still stuck in traffic. https://t.co/9zSdWSdzZz,2019-10-08 23:51:51,TweetDeck,1,1
Every time you fill up you’re paying considerably more for gas than most Americans thanks to policies enacted by California Democrats. https://t.co/T1ukVbk5TA,2019-10-08 02:09:38,Twitter for iPhone,4,10
With Democrats having complete control in Sacramento their failed policies are on full display when you drive through our California cities. Democrats have no one to blame but themselves for the homeless epidemic. A reckoning is coming next election. https://t.co/LxcvEMqPHG,2019-10-03 19:05:00,TweetDeck,2,4
Thankful a court has blocked this law and put a stop to a blatantly unconstitutional abuse of power by Gov. Newsom and Democrats in the CA legislature. https://t.co/Quh21ST29x,2019-09-20 02:25:19,TweetDeck,88,299

Democrats are making it clear that there’s no room in their party if you don’t embrace socialism. If you value liberty and freedom please know that you are more than welcome in the Republican Party.,2019-07-31 01:41:02,Twitter for iPhone,33,144
The open embrace of socialism at the #DemDebate is stunning. Are higher taxes and less freedom your priorities this election? Tell me here: https://t.co/LLrO4Rt5qi,2019-06-28 02:38:56,Twitter for iPhone,1,6
Still a FACT. https://t.co/ETeCqqP8fp,2019-06-28 01:47:49,Twitter for iPhone,1,2
Democrats are making it clear during the #DemDebate that they are coming to take away your private health insurance and put your health care decisions in the hands of the government. Tell me your priorities here: https://t.co/LLrO4Rt5qi,2019-06-27 02:54:08,Twitter for iPhone,0,6
FACT: When Democrats controlled the White House and Congress (including a 60 vote majority in the Senate) during President Obama’s first two years they did absolutely nothing to fix our broken immigration system. #DemDebate,2019-06-27 01:51:26,Twitter for iPhone,5,17
Democrats at tonight’s #DemDebate aren’t hiding the fact that they support policies that will raise taxes on American families. Are those your priorities? Take my survey here:  https://t.co/LLrO4Rt5qi,2019-06-27 01:23:47,Twitter for iPhone,2,5
Anyone who thinks that taking lanes away from cars will “help improve the flow of traffic” should have their head examined. It’s terrifying that Democrats in Sacramento have let the inmates run the asylum or in this case run the Dept. of Transportation. https://t.co/lylIy9PcDF,2019-05-29 03:01:24,Twitter for iPhone,0,1

I want to congratulate Jessica Patterson on being selected as the new Chair of the California Republican Party.

Today I joined GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy and Rep. @DanCrenshawTX  to talk about our fight to stop Democrats in their radical push towards socialism kicking families off their private health insurance and legalizing infanticide. The path back to the majority goes through CA. https://t.co/fstvirSlZE,2019-02-23 00:24:00,Twitter for iPhone,7,19
