Have Democrats in Congress gone to such an extreme that they won’t join Republicans in rejecting socialism and infanticide? Our American values and defense of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness should never become partisan. #SOTU,2019-02-06 04:21:50,TweetDeck,2,35

There’s no doubt that we live in a polarized political environment right now but if you stop and focus on the actual policies the President is outlining you will see that these are generally common-sense ideas that have broad support in our country. https://t.co/LMklxYyp3Y #SOTU https://t.co/osTg4g6xBH,2019-02-06 03:44:12,TweetDeck,1,12

Eliminating Prop 13 protections for CA job creators will trigger a massive tax hike that will destroy economic opportunities for middle-class families throughout our state.

I agree with the comments made here by Rep. Xochitl Torres Small (D-NM) about border security. It’s not a question of personnel vs technology vs physical barriers – we need all of it! https://t.co/JbK1PKPAra,2019-02-05 20:31:35,TweetDeck,1,7

An agreement where only one party upholds its side of the bargain is not an agreement. As the past and current US administrations have found Russia has failed for years to abide by the INF Treaty.

First NY Dems light up the One World Trade Center to celebrate legalizing abortions right up to birth. Then VA Dems advocate leaving a baby to die even after delivery.

There’s bipartisan support for physical barriers walls &amp; fences along our border. The range of funding we are negotiating over is a small fraction of our federal budget. We should avoid this brinkmanship and come to a compromise that secures our border and keeps the gov’t open.,2019-01-30 00:42:00,TweetDeck,12,28
