Hearing a lot of talk about the problems with our health care system from the same people who promised us Obamacare would fix it all.  @realDonaldTrump is delivering solutions. These candidates are just pushing more socialist programs that don't actually work. #DemDebate,2020-01-15 04:12:45,Twitter for iPhone,111,376
WATCH → Bernie Sanders admits he’d raise taxes on hardworking Americans making just $29000 a year to pay for his radical Medicare-for-All scheme that would give free health care to illegal immigrants. #DemDebate https://t.co/MjKchJ10qQ,2020-01-15 03:50:58,Twitter for iPhone,979,1687
While Dems at the #DemDebate pretend Obama’s failed Iran Deal and pallets of cash were working @realDonaldTrump is actually taking on the brutal Iranian regime standing up for our troops and taking out evil terrorists. 🇺🇸,2020-01-15 02:43:56,Twitter for iPhone,65,229
Fact check: @realDonaldTrump’s USMCA is a WIN for hardworking Americans all over this country.

Let's be clear: Dems aren't working for the American people. They're working for themselves.  They said they'd work with Trump. But instead they impeached him.  They said they wouldn't vote Pelosi for Speaker. But now they're rubber-stamping her socialist agenda.  What a sham. https://t.co/zz3uvoKVYZ,2019-12-30 03:35:36,Twitter for iPhone,543,1626
