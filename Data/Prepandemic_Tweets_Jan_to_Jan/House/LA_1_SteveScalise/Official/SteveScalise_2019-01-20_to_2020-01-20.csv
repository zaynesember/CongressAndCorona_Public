Impressive week for @realDonaldTrump:  – Stock market soared to a new high – Phase 1 of the China trade deal signed – USMCA passed the Senate  No surprise Dems finally sent their Articles of Impeachment to the Senate.

One thing is clear: Dems aren't interested in actually getting anything done for the American people.  They are the Party of Impeachment now. All they do is try to stop @realDonaldTrump from getting re-elected.  Their complete failure to govern is costing hardworking families. https://t.co/Fppw9DJsK5,2020-01-19 15:17:18,Twitter Media Studio,3021,8653

🚨 BREAKING → Dems finally voted to send their sham Articles of Impeachment to the Senate.  Among the people they chose to manage their phony case for them in the Senate are proven liar Adam Schiff and Jerry Nadler.  That tells you all you need to know about how serious this is.,2020-01-15 18:40:43,Twitter for iPhone,2808,7262
The contrast is clear:  Today @realDonaldTrump signed his trade deal with China that puts America first—another huge win for workers farmers and consumers.  Meanwhile Dems are wasting more time on their impeachment charade.  It's obvious who's actually working for our country.,2020-01-15 17:36:59,Twitter Web App,1903,4616
There it is folks. Pelosi admitted this is "an impeachment that will last forever."  It's all Dems care about. They never want it to end.  They're using Congress to get back at @realDonaldTrump for winning in 2016 and to try to stop him from winning in 2020. Nothing else.

.@realDonaldTrump is delivering for our country's forgotten men &amp; women: Jobs. Border Security. Strong Military.  The media &amp; far left radicals working with Pelosi to run our country into the ground can't stand it &amp; can't beat him.  So their response is to impeach him. Pathetic. https://t.co/AbnQ4MJzGx,2020-01-15 14:47:41,Twitter Media Studio,1477,4001
House Dems rushed impeachment claiming it was "urgent" &amp; their case was strong.  But clearly neither were true because Pelosi then sat on her articles for weeks begging the Senate to do more investigating &amp; mop up Schiff &amp; Nadler's mess.

Pelosi said today: – Trump won't be president next year "one way or another" – Dems may "have him removed sooner" than the election – Trump "will be impeached forever"  It's clear: Impeachment was a Democrat hit job to stain Trump’s legacy and hurt him at the polls. Nothing more. https://t.co/LY4TUwNiuZ,2020-01-12 21:09:37,Twitter for iPhone,17663,39087

Dems would rather stand with Iran than the United States—all because of their personal disdain for @realDonaldTrump. Unbelievable.,2020-01-09 23:17:23,Twitter for iPhone,6009,14226
Once again Dems are wasting time on stunts that don't actually do anything.  Pelosi's War Powers Resolution can't even become law. It's just a press release to attack @realDonaldTrump.  Enough already. This isn’t complicated: Soleimani was a brutal terrorist who deserved to die. https://t.co/gXwo5x0r7O,2020-01-09 22:27:05,Twitter Media Studio,1359,2710
WATCH → MSNBC's Chris Matthews says Soleimani was a "beloved hero" &amp; compares his death to the deaths of Princess Diana &amp; Elvis.  Trump Derangement Syndrome is real.

Dems used to claim impeachment was urgent.  But 22 DAYS after passing the articles Pelosi is still making pathetic excuses for not sending them to the Senate.  It's clear what's going on: Dems know their sham case will be exposed and are trying to avoid national embarrassment.,2020-01-09 17:01:16,Twitter Web App,596,1941
This impeachment is a joke. Pelosi's bizarre plan to hold on to the supposedly "urgent" articles has completely backfired.  Now even Democrat Senators one of her Committee Chairs and her own caucus members are telling her to quit playing games.  It's over. Pelosi lost. Move on. https://t.co/Vlw3SGOp3t,2020-01-09 15:17:29,Twitter Media Studio,733,2203
Question for Dems: How many more Americans did Soleimani need to kill before they would have supported @realDonaldTrump taking him out?  It comes down to this → Is the world a safer place without this terrorist in it? And the clear answer is yes. https://t.co/NJo5qJb7oU,2020-01-08 20:29:15,Twitter Media Studio,3433,9518

This is a safer world because a brutal terrorist who killed hundreds of Americans and was planning to kill even more is dead because of the bold action of @realDonaldTrump.  All Americans should be united against this evil. It's disappointing to see Dems try to make it partisan. https://t.co/bIV0ol8Xwv,2020-01-08 16:25:55,Twitter for iPhone,1102,3308

Amazing to watch Dems and the media try to convince people that Pelosi refusing to send her own "urgent" Articles of Impeachment to the Senate makes her a genius. It doesn't.  Reality Check: She's not sending them because she knows their entire sham will collapse when she does.,2020-01-07 15:46:53,Twitter Web App,4176,12985

Pelosi has no role in the Senate.

This is all a sham! https://t.co/vh90HbwdXb,2019-12-18 15:29:57,Twitter Media Studio,5313,13192
Make no mistake → Impeaching @realDonaldTrump was the Dems' plan from Day 1.  More than 100 Dems had already voted to impeach the President before the Ukraine call even took place.  They're not somber. They're not thoughtful. They're trying to settle a political score. Period. https://t.co/3SNvMMM3iB,2019-12-18 13:25:39,Twitter Media Studio,6754,18664

Pelosi listed 3 requirements to move forward with impeachment:  Bipartisan ❌ Overwhelming ❌ Compelling ❌  Dems failed to meet all of those standards. Yet they're moving forward anyway.  Why?

Meet the “star witnesses” Adam Schiff called today:  - Neither have any firsthand knowledge - Neither spoke to @realDonaldTrump  - One got his info from The New York Times  This hearing is a sham. Read the transcript—an actual firsthand account. It shows nothing impeachable!,2019-11-13 16:38:24,Twitter for iPhone,21517,65193
Schiff has emerged from his bunker to put on a public show. But the facts haven't changed.   - @realDonaldTrump and Zelensky both say there was no pressure - Ukraine got the aid - There were no impeachable offenses  This is a sham.,2019-11-13 15:15:59,Twitter for iPhone,12278,39575
Because Pelosi is obsessed with impeachment:  → Our troops don't have the equipment they need → Prescription drug prices haven't been lowered → The southern border is not secure  Yet today Dems will continue wasting even more time &amp; taxpayer money on their impeachment charade. https://t.co/xit0Bsgaqp,2019-11-13 14:15:45,Twitter Media Studio,5450,9448

The Dems’ impeachment charade is pre-baked.  They’re not interested in actually hearing the facts. They’ve already made up their minds and just want a show.  After all these are the same people who launched the inquiry before seeing the transcript.  Take their word for it ↓ https://t.co/l4R4b2kPVm,2019-11-10 17:29:07,Twitter for iPhone,2991,7314

Schiff said we’d hear from the whistleblower.  But when collusion between the whistleblower &amp; Schiff’s staff was revealed he changed his tune.  Republicans requested the whistleblower as a witness in Schiff’s show hearings. Will he block him out to avoid people seeing the truth?,2019-11-09 15:51:25,Twitter for iPhone,10881,33159
🚨 More collusion between Dems &amp; their star witnesses revealed:  Yovanovitch communicated with Democrat staff BEFORE the whistleblower report was even public &amp; then lied under oath trying to cover up the secret dealings.  Just further proof this is rigged! https://t.co/DuPS75cvsF,2019-11-08 13:30:25,Twitter for iPhone,6272,11566
One of Schiff’s star witnesses admitted he has zero firsthand knowledge of @realDonaldTrump’s objectives with Ukraine and never communicated with the President.  So what’s his source for his false accusations of a quid pro quo? The New York Times.  You can’t make this stuff up! https://t.co/YqLTLG5uRW,2019-11-08 01:50:12,Twitter for iPhone,2058,3406
🚨 Proof the Dems' entire impeachment charade has been an orchestrated set up from the start ↓  Tweets from the whistleblower's attorney targeting @realDonaldTrump in 2017:  "Coup has started...impeachment will follow ultimately"  "We will get rid of him" https://t.co/yhDL20Cv1f,2019-11-07 14:36:04,Twitter for iPhone,6952,13120
Democrats still refuse to accept that @realDonaldTrump won the 2016 election—so they’re dragging the country through months and months of pointless investigations trying to undo it.  Congress should be focused on real issues—not wasting time on Pelosi’s impeachment charade. https://t.co/imHX3gPmh0,2019-11-06 01:49:31,Twitter for iPhone,2613,7371
What the media won’t tell you about Schiff’s transcripts:  One of his star witnesses said our Ukraine policy is STRONGER under @realDonaldTrump than it was under Obama.  Turns out the Dems’ claim that Trump undermined U.S. interests was just another one of their lies. https://t.co/1kKYIvdmSN,2019-11-05 00:13:45,Twitter Web App,2611,4172
🚨🚨 Dems are selectively releasing transcripts from their closed-door hearings.  The big "bombshell" they're trying to sell? @realDonaldTrump let holdovers from the Obama Administration go.  THIS is what they expect Americans to believe is impeachable? It’s laughable.,2019-11-04 19:30:30,Twitter for iPhone,6254,15670
The Democrat Playbook:  1) Leak misleading info &amp; outright lies from Schiff's secretive hearings  2) Let their partners in the liberal media run with it to attack @realDonaldTrump before they have to admit it was fake news  3) Repeat  You can't undo the damage done by this sham. https://t.co/h0nzvwoGKj,2019-11-04 02:32:47,Twitter Media Studio,3075,7144
Dems are using impeachment as a political tactic to damage @realDonaldTrump at the ballot box. That's a disgusting abuse of power.  They've even admitted he'll be re-elected if they don't impeach.  The next election should be decided by the American people—not Pelosi and Schiff. https://t.co/COpMNy1lgs,2019-11-03 19:43:37,Twitter Media Studio,14215,43585
What Dems are calling "due process":  • Continuing Schiff's secret hearings • Letting Schiff/Nadler kick @realDonaldTrump's attorney out of the room and shut out witnesses Republicans call to discredit their misleading one-sided narrative  This impeachment inquiry is a joke! https://t.co/Kiy5EFySHs,2019-11-03 16:03:58,Twitter Media Studio,3491,8172
Same story different day for Dems.   They’ve wanted to impeach @realDonaldTrump from Day 1.  First they tried to use the Mueller Report. When that didn’t work they started pushing a hoax about a phone call.

🚨 BREAKING: Dems are voting to continue their Soviet-style impeachment scheme.  They're not interested in due process.  They're not interested in ending Schiff's secretive witch hunt.

Since LITERALLY DAY 1 Democrats have been trying to impeach @realDonaldTrump.   They didn't have a legitimate reason then and they don't have a legitimate reason now.  It's long past time for Democrats and the liberal media to give up their baseless impeachment witch hunt. https://t.co/gtTYO7xEwV,2019-10-03 16:21:07,Twitter Web App,648,1298
The fix is in. This impeachment scheme is all about politics for Democrats. They're trying to rig 2020 against @realDonaldTrump. Take their word for it:  "What's more serious is that he can't win" -Nancy Pelosi  "If we don't impeach...he will get re-elected" -Rep Al Green https://t.co/XY1CyY4UCv,2019-10-03 12:05:52,Twitter Media Studio,9765,20264
Democrats are making a mockery of Congress.  Adam Schiff is a proven partisan with a history of making false allegations in pursuit of his political agenda to impeach @realDonaldTrump &amp; undo the 2016 election.  The way he runs the Intel Committee is an outrageous abuse of power.,2019-10-02 22:17:19,Twitter for iPhone,481,1305
🚨🚨 This is looking more &amp; more like a deep state scheme.   Schiff knew about the whistleblower complaint before it was filed &amp; his team advised the whistleblower on how to proceed.   He's running the same playbook against @realDonaldTrump that Senate Dems ran against Kavanaugh. https://t.co/CAbaJYTjU9,2019-10-02 19:20:19,Twitter Web App,2528,4803
Democrats in Washington are so obsessed with their pointless impeachment scheme that they're prioritizing it over the ratification of #USMCA.

Democrats have been throwing out baseless accusations against @realDonaldTrump since before he was even elected—and they’ve all turned out to be wrong.   There has to be a level of responsibility. These reckless Democrat schemes are beyond madness at this point. https://t.co/4xYyLucCbz,2019-10-01 13:08:34,Twitter for iPhone,2331,5609
Radicals &amp; socialists have taken over the Democrat Party. They're calling all the shots now.

Pelosi said there'd be reasons to impeach @realDonaldTrump BEFORE she had the facts. She was wrong.  Here's the bottom line: No high crimes &amp; misdemeanors. Time to MOVE ON!  We should be focused on: - Passing #USMCA - Solving the border crisis - Lowering prescription drug prices https://t.co/joDMCuY9Pw,2019-09-29 18:50:09,Twitter Media Studio,4109,11692
I won't let the media get away with reciting Democrat talking points.  The fact is Pelosi broke precedent &amp; started this baseless impeachment inquiry without a vote.  Why? She wanted to shield her members from going on record that they support this witch hunt of @realDonaldTrump. https://t.co/TCIJSsFfKS,2019-09-29 16:23:24,Twitter Media Studio,11925,28102
Let me get this straight: Adam Schiff—the man who falsely claimed there was more than circumstantial evidence of collusion—is now trying to convince the American people that there were high crimes &amp; misdemeanors despite the fact that the transcript shows none?  Give me a break. https://t.co/hvrUXkseoB,2019-09-29 14:54:52,Twitter Media Studio,5986,13262
Pelosi bypassed the official vote that's typically required to start an impeachment inquiry.  Schiff read a made-up transcript in a hearing.  Now they've recessed the House for 2 WEEKS.  This isn't a serious fact-based process. It's a reckless scheme to attack @realDonaldTrump. https://t.co/xyRItmwiXC,2019-09-28 16:37:49,Twitter Media Studio,6553,13975
Nancy Pelosi launched an impeachment inquiry before she even had the facts.  Well now we have the facts and they show there was no quid pro quo on that call—or any crime at all.  Dems have run this reckless scheme time and time again against @realDonaldTrump. Enough is enough. https://t.co/oRNaYrrrWs,2019-09-27 12:53:56,Twitter Media Studio,3271,8763
Dems said then: - Impeachment=undoing an election - Impeachment must be bipartisan - Impeachment supporters are driven by hatred  Dems now: - Trying to undo the 2016 election - Have no bipartisan support - Filled with hatred of @realDonaldTrump  Their hypocrisy is unbelievable. https://t.co/uyN5iQSinT,2019-09-27 00:47:53,Twitter Media Studio,2147,4338

We have the transcript.  So why did Schiff make up his own version of the call in a Congressional hearing?  Because he knows the transcript shows no quid pro quo or crimes.  Dems are literally making stuff up now because they have no legitimate reason to impeach @realDonaldTrump. https://t.co/i4138ocqJ3,2019-09-26 16:39:04,Twitter Media Studio,15498,37892
Democrats have based this entire whistleblower hearing off of a man with zero firsthand knowledge of the call instead of the actual transcript—which shows no quid pro quo and no crimes.   That's beyond reckless. They are making a mockery of the United States Congress. https://t.co/SxO3CcNlEi,2019-09-26 15:45:31,Twitter Web App,632,1307
Democrats promised there would be quid pro quo in the Ukraine call transcript.  Democrats promised there would be collusion in the Mueller Report.  None of that turned out to be true.

Dems have lost their minds.  Their scheme to impeach @realDonaldTrump using the Mueller Report fell apart since it showed no collusion.  So they sunk to grasping at secondhand rumors about a call—only to have the transcript reveal there was no crime there either.  Enough already! https://t.co/V22kDZelBT,2019-09-25 19:14:12,Twitter Media Studio,1243,3410
The Democrats' Mueller Report playbook is back.  Yesterday Nancy Pelosi recklessly claimed @realDonaldTrump broke laws based on false media reports and secondhand accusations—not facts.

Dems launched an impeachment inquiry based on a rumor instead of waiting for the facts.  It's now clear: there was no quid pro quo. @realDonaldTrump didn't break any laws.  But this has never been about facts or laws for Dems &amp; the media—they just want to undo the 2016 election.,2019-09-25 15:27:06,Twitter Web App,10680,38564

Shoot first aim later. That's the reckless motto of Chairman Nadler's Judiciary Committee. They have nothing to impeach @realDonaldTrump on.

This insane hyperpartisanship is a sickness. It’s disgusting when some care more about assigning blame for an attack than they do about getting the facts and preventing the next tragedy.   My @WSJ op-ed ↓ https://t.co/jBPDAjkjHA,2019-08-08 16:32:12,Twitter for iPhone,2101,5478
If the events of this past weekend taught us anything it’s that we need to stop seeing our neighbors as political enemies. This kind of dangerous targeting isn’t how we heal our nation.,2019-08-06 20:49:36,Twitter for iPhone,2376,8511
People should not be personally targeted for their political views. Period. This isn’t a game. It’s dangerous and lives are at stake. I know this firsthand. https://t.co/PbxUMIOhae,2019-08-06 20:49:35,Twitter for iPhone,20169,51197
I filed a discharge petition to bypass Pelosi and force a vote on @RepAnnWagner’s #BornAlive Act to protect babies who survive attempted abortions. Every Republican has signed the petition. But it’s been 6 months and only 3 Democrats have been willing to sign it. That’s shameful.,2019-08-05 13:23:18,Twitter for iPhone,561,1719
Far too many babies born alive during attempted abortions are denied crucial medical care and left to die. Liberals in Washington aren’t just ignoring this horrific practice they’re actively preventing a vote on protections for abortion survivors. https://t.co/xZxhzpPlQX,2019-08-05 13:23:17,Twitter for iPhone,1779,3902
These events are tragedies. Reducing them to talking points and name-calling in support of narrow political agendas only further divides our country.   Jennifer and I pray for the people of El Paso and Dayton. May God help us and heal this great nation.,2019-08-04 21:01:04,Twitter Web App,438,1858
In a media culture that encourages viewing people solely through hyper-partisan lenses and not as neighbors and fellow citizens dangerous division and hatred of those you disagree with is the outcome. This can often lead to violent consequences as I've personally experienced.,2019-08-04 21:01:03,Twitter Web App,400,1638
There is clearly a culture of death in America today. Violence is glorified and normalized on our screens every day. Instead of seeking professional help for mental health problems men are being radicalized in online forums. This must stop.,2019-08-04 21:01:03,Twitter Web App,153,513
These events should be classified as domestic terrorism and I’m glad that in the case of El Paso the FBI is treating it as such. We must better equip our law enforcement agencies to prevent these massacres before they happen.,2019-08-04 21:01:03,Twitter Web App,144,506
THREAD:  There is a sickness in our nation. Our religious &amp; community institutions—the glue that bonds us—are declining as a central force in society while the politicization of every aspect of life rises.

Americans agree → We should protect babies who survive abortions and guarantee them life-saving medical care.   So why has Pelosi blocked a bill to do that 80 times this year? And why have ONLY 3 Democrats signed my discharge petition to bypass her and vote now? We need action. https://t.co/oUu6qSxetl,2019-08-01 22:43:40,Twitter for iPhone,984,2585
Even after a 2-year $25 million dollar witch hunt and a disastrous Mueller Hearing impeaching @realDonaldTrump is still the only thing Democrats can focus on.   There was no collusion!

Retweet if you agree → Democrats should focus on solving the humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border—not impeaching @realDonaldTrump because they still refuse to accept the results of the 2016 election. https://t.co/JHxPFjCFrB,2019-07-28 15:38:11,Twitter for iPhone,5176,9582

This Democrat majority has been a failure. They’ve left for the summer after wasting 7 months harassing @realDonaldTrump instead of solving real problems.  We still need to:  → End the border crisis → Lower prescription drug prices → Pass #USMCA for American workers &amp; farmers https://t.co/Hil8qzVsmq,2019-07-26 17:49:00,Twitter for iPhone,2837,6838

Time to end this witch hunt! https://t.co/qcvmLvRoBD,2019-07-25 14:50:41,Twitter Web App,315,1307
The case has long been closed. There was NO COLLUSION.  The fact that Democrats are still pursuing their deranged WITCH HUNT of @realDonaldTrump with baseless investigations and absurd hearings proves that the only thing on their agenda is harassment and impeachment. https://t.co/nhtgKiQdiJ,2019-07-24 22:17:15,Twitter Media Studio,919,3381
The Democrat-controlled Judiciary Committee that wasted today trying to re-do the #Mueller report because they don't like the outcome is the SAME committee with jurisdiction over the border crisis. We could solve real problems if Dems would quit their @realDonaldTrump witch hunt. https://t.co/MDWVmubJaO,2019-07-24 18:16:21,Twitter Media Studio,1172,2976
If this #Mueller hearing is proving anything it’s that this 2 year $25-million-dollar investigation was a witch hunt to harass @realDonaldTrump—nobody else has been treated this way even Robert Mueller says so! https://t.co/hPt4sHdN8R,2019-07-24 14:27:58,Twitter for iPhone,873,2424
If Democrats including the dozens who co-sponsored anti-BDS legislation last Congress weren't so afraid of The Squad they'd sign my discharge petition to force Pelosi to allow a vote on the Senate-passed bill that actually provides the resources to combat BDS &amp; protect Israel. https://t.co/ApKaCal6Ui,2019-07-24 00:50:21,Twitter Web App,281,1025
Let's be clear: The BDS movement is anti-Semitic and it's dangerous to our ally Israel. Today's resolution denouncing BDS is a good step. But words aren't enough. We need action. House Democrat Leadership needs to quit blocking a vote on the bipartisan Senate bill with teeth. https://t.co/WK2tGZwLaj,2019-07-24 00:49:53,Twitter Web App,633,1803
Today Squad Member Rep. Tlaib called Israel's government racist &amp; outrageously suggested the anti-Semitic BDS movement is equivalent to boycotting Nazi Germany.

Nancy Pelosi is blocking critical legislation to combat the dangerous BDS movement from receiving a vote in the House. Today the Democrat Majority Leader agreed BDS is harmful to our ally Israel.

The Senate took swift action earlier this year against the BDS movement by passing S. 1 in a widely bipartisan vote.

Congratulations to my friend and colleague @repdonyoung on becoming the longest serving Republican in the history of Congress! Honored to serve with you. https://t.co/JRYi0IvwPn,2019-03-06 22:00:03,Twitter Media Studio,57,256
Republicans weren't consulted on H.R. 1 and Democrats once again voted down every single Republican amendment to the bill. It sets up a system of fraud abuse and misuse of taxpayer funds. Bottom line: H.R. 1 leaves the future and integrity of our elections in doubt.,2019-03-06 21:00:29,Twitter Web Client,1532,2337
Follow the money: H.R. 1 diverts taxpayer funds into candidates' and consultants' pockets by expanding the use of campaign funds to include child care and other personal expenses. Democrats are pursuing "reforms" that benefit themselves not the American people.,2019-03-06 21:00:29,Twitter Web Client,1243,1883
After promising to run a transparent House Democrats let special interest groups write a 622-page federal takeover of elections blatantly tailored to use taxpayer money to enrich candidates and campaign consultants with a 6 to 1 taxpayer-funded match of small dollar donations.,2019-03-06 21:00:29,Twitter Web Client,1045,1347
H.R. 1 the “Democrat Politician Protection Act"   + Forces states to allow felons to vote + Overrides state voter ID laws + Removes safeguards to prevent voter fraud  + Creates a system where taxpayer money funds candidates the taxpayer doesn't support,2019-03-06 21:00:29,Twitter Web Client,5642,6462
Sounds like an emergency. https://t.co/QXBiv15FLZ,2019-03-06 17:02:19,Twitter Web Client,866,2255

This is beyond a witch hunt. Democrats decided their end game before even looking at the facts. They never accepted the results of the 2016 election and are now spending their time and taxpayer resources trying to appease their radical base by marching towards impeachment. https://t.co/QS2a791KMl,2019-03-05 21:23:08,Twitter Media Studio,3529,8518
The resolution only addresses part of the issue. Rep. Omar continues to make anti-Semitic remarks. These are her beliefs. If Nancy Pelosi is serious about denouncing anti-Semitism &amp; supporting one of our strongest allies she should remove Omar from the Foreign Affairs Committee. https://t.co/iowehTTwVR,2019-03-05 18:30:30,Twitter Media Studio,1341,2971

Resolutions are all well and good but Speaker Pelosi is clearly afraid to stand up to Rep. Omar if she continues to reward her with a plum spot on the Foreign Affairs Committee. https://t.co/RtSilrn29j,2019-03-04 20:53:15,Twitter Web Client,3420,8835

The reality: The gun control laws Democrats passed this week to take away your rights wouldn’t have stopped any of the recent mass shootings. Instead they should focus on holding bureaucrats who failed us all by not properly enforcing the laws already on the books accountable. https://t.co/apoCEmQbWm,2019-03-02 20:05:22,Twitter for iPhone,3265,8087

Republicans have worked with @realDonaldTrump to unleash the American economy. Job growth and wages are up. Taxes and unemployment are down.

Democrats who told their constituents they’re pro-life and pro-2nd Amendment are now voting for Nancy Pelosi’s radical liberal agenda—stripping gun rights from law abiding citizens and allowing babies born alive during an abortion to be killed.

A new low for Democrats → By voting to make it harder for domestic violence victims to protect themselves from abusers Democrats proved to the American people that they aren’t serious about preventing gun violence and are instead just interested in pushing their liberal agenda. https://t.co/g2Tg9GyGao,2019-02-28 19:25:03,Twitter Web Client,1562,2984
Every day in this country guns are used by good people to defend themselves against bad people and H.R. 8 is going to make it harder for them to get access to these guns. This is a bad gun control bill that does nothing but criminalize law-abiding citizens.,2019-02-27 23:00:34,Twitter Web Client,888,2115
Democrats say there is an exemption for hunting in the bill but it’s written so vaguely that if you want to loan your gun to a hunting buddy you might need to bring along your attorney to find out if loaning a shotgun to your friend makes you a criminal.,2019-02-27 23:00:33,Twitter Web Client,540,1471
Under this bill a woman might have to wait 20 business days to get a gun to protect herself from domestic violence if the NICS system isn’t working. If she borrows a firearm for self-defense the friend who loans her a gun would face a year in prison and up to a $100000 fine.,2019-02-27 23:00:33,Twitter Web Client,472,702
I strongly oppose the gun control bills brought forward this week under the guise of background checks. Republicans identified many problems with this bill and the Democrat majority shut out almost every one of our solutions.,2019-02-27 23:00:33,Twitter Web Client,2349,6112
Democrats should just call Medicare For All what it is: a radical government-run socialist health care program that forces 158 million Americans off their plans and costs taxpayers even more than Bernie Sanders’ $32 trillion dollar plan. https://t.co/KhtCe8oBgw,2019-02-27 20:17:33,Twitter Web Client,858,1637
Every single day Americans use guns to defend themselves from criminals. That’s the intent of the 2nd Amendment. All Americans should have the right to protect themselves. But these Democrat gun control bills threaten that right. https://t.co/nrT5lYq2OZ,2019-02-27 18:27:52,Twitter Web Client,625,1293
The Democrat gun control bills we are voting on this week reveal the Democrats' radical leftist agenda. This legislation is just another step towards a national gun registry. https://t.co/dTLuoNInYz,2019-02-27 18:27:51,Twitter Web Client,482,1070
Democrats refused to let me testify at their gun control hearing because I won't spread their radical gun control message. But the American people deserve the truth: the Democrat gun control bills take away the rights of law-abiding citizens and make it harder to defend yourself. https://t.co/P2wJrQw3YR,2019-02-27 18:27:50,Twitter Web Client,5366,10219
The Democrat gun control bills will make criminals out of law-abiding citizens—yet they won’t allow an illegal immigrant who fails a background check while trying to buy a gun to be turned over to ICE. That’s disgraceful and it shows their true intentions. https://t.co/AQxocoRQyH,2019-02-27 14:42:38,Twitter Media Studio,1052,1886
I’m joining The @IngrahamAngle on @FoxNews tonight to share my story and the truth about the Democrat gun control bill the House is voting on this week: it’s not a serious attempt to prevent gun violence and instead aims to take away the rights of law-abiding U.S. citizens.,2019-02-27 03:35:24,Twitter for iPhone,1292,3723
These are only a few of the real atrocities caused by illegal immigrant crime. Democrats calling this emergency fake owe an apology to #AngelFamilies and an explanation to the American people about what exactly their plan is to stop these preventable tragedies.,2019-02-26 23:41:18,Twitter Web Client,344,839

In Speaker Pelosi's own backyard an illegal immigrant who had been deported multiple times recently shot at a sheriff’s deputy. How can Democrats ignore this? https://t.co/m1Rlb9Mysx,2019-02-26 23:41:18,Twitter Web Client,249,441
How can Democrats call the crisis at our border fake when day after day we see heinous crimes committed by illegal immigrants against innocent Americans?

Democrats just voted to try to cancel the National Emergency @realDonaldTrump declared to secure our southern border. This is a slap in the face to our experts who put their lives on the line to protect our country and are pleading for more resources to combat the border crisis. https://t.co/aXn2ceQ4Pv,2019-02-26 23:41:17,Twitter Web Client,2588,5360
The Democrat gun control bill the House is voting on this week is more about taking rights away from law-abiding U.S. citizens than stopping gun violence. https://t.co/1Zh9WUitVj,2019-02-26 18:47:26,Twitter Web Client,500,1057
You shouldn’t face a $100000 fine and year in prison if you lend your pistol to a victim of domestic violence who needs to defend herself from someone she has a temporary restraining order against. But that’s what would happen under the Democrat gun control bill. https://t.co/x9h25Z5sg0,2019-02-26 18:47:26,Twitter Web Client,519,1082
Democrats refused to listen to my testimony as a survivor of gun violence and supporter of the 2nd Amendment because they're only interested in hearing from liberal gun control advocates.

It’s no coincidence that more Americans have identified as pro-life over the past month as Democrats advocated for radical infanticide practices. This month I started the process to force consideration on the House Floor of a bill to protect babies born alive during an abortion. https://t.co/48w316MEyd,2019-02-25 19:57:49,Twitter Web Client,2332,8216
I will never stop fighting for the unborn. I recently joined with @RepAnnWagner to begin forcing a vote on the House Floor to protect babies born alive during abortions.

It’s simple: deported illegal immigrants who committed crimes in the United States should not be able to come right back into our country unchecked. Yet Democrats refuse to provide our Border Patrol agents with the tools needed to prevent this from happening over and over again. https://t.co/lAzECv5SSs,2019-02-20 14:17:40,Twitter Media Studio,3841,7961

A deported child sex offender was able to illegally cross back into our country to potentially harm other kids in Louisiana. That’s outrageous. And it’s why @realDonaldTrump and Republicans are taking action to increase border security and build a wall. https://t.co/ty92cNcr0z,2019-02-20 00:26:35,Twitter Web Client,2419,4274

Democrats blocked an amendment to alert ICE when an illegal immigrant tries to purchase a gun and fails a background check. Why do they want to make it easier for criminals in the country illegally to get guns than law-abiding U.S. citizens? https://t.co/raX4llUZz4,2019-02-19 16:56:51,Twitter for iPhone,6639,8515
