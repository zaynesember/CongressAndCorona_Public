Low-income women and women of color are disproportionately blocked from accessing their full reproductive health options because of the Hyde Amendment and I’m glad to join with my colleagues in fighting for its repeal.,2019-03-15 18:04:10,Twitter Web Client,12,33
Women have a Constitutional right in our country to make their own decisions about their health care including abortion. But the Hyde Amendment effectively denies that right so that only women who can afford to access their right to an abortion can do so.,2019-03-15 18:04:10,Twitter Web Client,9,25
Proud to help introduce the EACH Woman Act which repeals the Hyde Amendment and ensures that all women – regardless of their income level – can make their own choices about their reproductive health care. #4EACHofUs #BeBoldEndHyde https://t.co/RxX6KeWhcD,2019-03-15 18:04:10,Twitter Web Client,10,29
We need a comprehensive federal plan that looks at all angles and a new federal office to bring folks together and take action. Given that climate change is only exacerbating the spread of Lyme disease this work is more important than ever.,2019-03-15 16:53:44,Twitter Web Client,3,9

The folks I've met with have given me new ideas to work on as a member of the @HouseAgDems &amp; at a recent committee hearing I invited Ag Sec. Sonny Perdue here to NY-19 after he dismissed struggles of small farms by just pointing to "economies of scale." https://t.co/Ik2FMWuPNo,2019-03-14 18:45:37,Twitter Web Client,0,10
In my first weeks in office I’ve prioritized meeting with farmers. I’ve heard about everything from localized infrastructure needs to cutting-edge sustainable farming techniques. https://t.co/e8R7SL5LSR,2019-03-14 18:45:36,Twitter Web Client,0,5
It’s #NationalAgDay! NY-19 is the 3rd most rural district held by a Democrat and the 8th most rural in the country. We’re home to over 5000 farms and over 8000 farm operations. Couldn’t be more proud to be a voice for family farms here in Upstate New York.,2019-03-14 18:45:36,Twitter Web Client,5,29

In the face of an Administration that has tried to pull the rug out from under these young people &amp; engaged in inhumane &amp; cruel practices separating children from their families we’re standing strong with #Dreamers &amp; immigrant communities today by introducing this landmark bill.,2019-03-12 19:01:40,Twitter Web Client,3,20
We have young people in our country who came here as kids – this country is their home. And we have families who came to our nation fleeing dangerous conditions who were granted protections in this country and yet many are now being told to leave.,2019-03-12 19:01:40,Twitter Web Client,3,16
I signed on as an original cosponsor to Dream &amp; Promise Act of 2019. It goes against our fundamental values to deport individuals who are here for no other reason than to contribute to &amp; work toward our shared hopes &amp; dreams as a nation. #ProtectTheDream https://t.co/BNwiDODIBz,2019-03-12 19:01:40,Twitter Web Client,9,42

It continues to balloon the deficit without investing in ways that provide real returns for everyday Americans in search of upward mobility and shared prosperity.,2019-03-11 22:46:19,Twitter Web Client,1,13
The budget calls for repeal of the ACA and devastating cuts to Social Security Medicare and Medicaid; eliminates important rural development programs; and cuts crop insurance. It also makes severe cuts to education aid as well as critical environmental protections.,2019-03-11 22:46:19,Twitter Web Client,6,17
Budget throws tax breaks at wealthy few at expense of Upstate NY; it puts forth billions for a wall Congress squarely rejected &amp; increases mil. spending beyond what Pentagon asked for while calling for drastic cuts in programs that actually help folks here https://t.co/AydON1yjfP,2019-03-11 22:46:19,Twitter Web Client,4,20
We all know that milk is important for our kids to drink yet they're drinking less of it in schools right now. Moreover expanding milk options in schools empowers our local dairy farmers.,2019-03-11 20:55:10,Twitter Web Client,9,42
I’m very pleased to sign on as a cosponsor to the bipartisan Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act of 2019 which allows schools that participate in the School Lunch Program to buy flavored and unflavored whole milk for students. https://t.co/ph29xlYg3V,2019-03-11 20:55:10,Twitter Web Client,11,51

The work we’re doing right now changes that. I’m very proud to be a leader in this effort to pass #HR1 including the CLEAR Act which I introduced earlier this year in order to shine a spotlight on dark money in politics. #ForThePeople,2019-03-08 16:36:55,Twitter Web Client,2,16
When 80% of country asked to share just 20% of wealth when 80% asked to live paycheck to paycheck &amp; when unlimited amount of $ allowed to influence politics only a few truly have access to gov't officials as only a few have means to do so--that’s an oligarchy not a democracy.,2019-03-08 16:36:55,Twitter Web Client,2,19
Casting my vote for #HR1 today signifies a historic step forward in our efforts to fix our broken system. It is a culmination of years of people demanding that Congress reject outsized influence of special interests &amp; money in politics. https://t.co/90jEi07c7Q,2019-03-08 16:36:55,Twitter Web Client,4,38

From the first bill I introduced--which focused on helping the spouses of service-disabled veterans--I've made it a top priority of mine to hear from veterans and work to ensure they receive the benefits they deserve.

At a @HouseSmallBiz hearing I talked about investing in our communities so farmers &amp; business owners can expand their markets. I started by sharing experiences of a family-owned farm in Otsego County that often drives up to 5 hrs to deliver its products. https://t.co/ZWgn34W2My,2019-02-16 18:39:15,Twitter for iPhone,0,12

Before she was killed Chief Kent was working to change this flawed system not just for herself but for all members of the Armed Services. And now I'm working to understand what happened in Chief Kent's case and what can be done to make sure it doesn't happen again.,2019-02-15 21:05:06,Twitter Web Client,1,17
Before she went on her final deployment to Syria she wanted to enlist in a Ph.D. program -- but because she was a survivor of thyroid cancer she was disqualified.

I went to the House floor to honor the memory of Chief Shannon M. Kent who is from Pine Plains and gave the ultimate sacrifice in service to our country. https://t.co/NA4diEKRvo,2019-02-15 21:05:06,Twitter Web Client,8,42

Unsurprisingly the terms of the agreement are far from perfect but the bipartisan legislation does avert another harmful shutdown and allows us to get back to the important work we were sent here to do.,2019-02-15 03:26:16,Twitter for iPhone,3,25
I’m pleased that Republicans and Democrats in the House and Senate came to an agreement to fund the government. However that such an agreement could only be reached with the threat of yet another government shutdown is an indictment of our failing political system.,2019-02-15 03:26:16,Twitter for iPhone,4,34

Glad to cosponsor bipartisan bill to eliminate SALT cap. The 2017 tax law irresponsibly added more than $1 trillion to deficit while creating the cap that results in double taxation for middle- &amp; working-class families.

Reducing the alliance between the U.S. and Israel to being all about money is historically inaccurate; evokes ugly stereotypes intentionally or otherwise; and ignores the ties forged by shared interests values and generations of Jewish families including my own.,2019-02-11 21:01:24,Twitter Web Client,15,64
One of my favorite questions at last week's town hall in Sullivan County was about how we should go about addressing climate change.

Amidst the government shutdown we're holding our first town hall tomorrow at 2 PM at the Poestenkill Fire Department. If you can't make it in person comment or send us a message with your question and we'll take some of the questions submitted online during the town hall! https://t.co/aK9t1Hxwuh,2019-01-20 21:36:24,Twitter for iPhone,50,140
