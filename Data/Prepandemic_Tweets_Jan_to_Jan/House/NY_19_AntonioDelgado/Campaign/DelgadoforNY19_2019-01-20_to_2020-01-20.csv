Access to high speed broadband ought to be treated as a utility—&amp; necessity—for businesses &amp; farms to compete in the global economy. I will continue to call for improved mapping technology to include accurate counts for rural communities.,2019-08-10 14:16:54,Twitter for iPhone,1,27
The @FCC's use of census block mapping where one house on one block with broadband access meant the whole block was deemed "served" left rural communities behind &amp; increased the #DigitalDivide.

Considering a tax break that would "overwhelmingly benefit the top 0.1%" in the face of so much inequality is disgraceful. It would also add $100B to our nat'l debt.

Aid should not be based on the size of the farm. 96% of farms in #NY19 are family-owned &amp; the majority are small farms. They deserve an equal opportunity to get back on their feet &amp; recover losses.,2019-07-30 21:54:51,Twitter Web App,11,43

Right now it's critical that we work together to ensure resources are getting to these facilities that have been overwhelmed by a major influx of migrants &amp; asylum seekers.

We must balance our need for security at our border that keeps our country safe with our own core values. We cannot forget we were founded as a nation of immigrants.

Between 2006-2012 while America's largest drug companies saturated communities across the country with pain pills nearly 100000 people died from the opioid epidemic.

Parents shouldn't have to take a 2nd or 3rd job to cover their children's healthcare costs. People shouldn't be forced to ration life-saving medicine or skip necessary medical treatment. We cannot be the only developed country in the world without universal healthcare coverage.,2019-07-18 19:49:25,Twitter for iPhone,0,22
4 in 10 American workers said they had trouble affording healthcare in the last year despite having job-based health coverage. We need a public option to increase competition &amp; drive down healthcare costs. That's exactly why I introduced the Medicare-X Choice Act.,2019-07-18 19:49:24,Twitter for iPhone,1,21
Many middle class families with health insurance from their employer still can't pay their healthcare bills. They face stagnant wages along with premiums that take more &amp; more of their paychecks &amp; soaring deductibles.   https://t.co/nUdp4hOTtp,2019-07-18 19:49:24,Twitter for iPhone,2,23
The current federal minimum wage ($7.25 an hour) hasn't been raised since 2009. It equals about $15k a year for someone working 40 hours a week or about $10k less than the federal poverty level for a family of 4. This increase is essential to helping people live with dignity.,2019-07-18 16:41:56,Twitter Web Client,4,23
Our economy isn't working for working people. Addressing stagnant wages is key to closing the gap of income inequality. Gradually raising the federal minimum wage to $15 means increased income for up to 33 million Americans including 80000 in #NY19. https://t.co/ael45R01uc,2019-07-18 16:41:56,Twitter Web Client,14,48

Sen. Paul voted for $1.5 trillion in tax cuts that added billions to our deficit &amp; now says "massive debt" is reason enough not to renew #911VCF. It's unconscionable.

Tariffs equate to a significant tax increase on Americans by raising the prices of goods.

It's undeniable that the trade war is negatively impacting U.S. industries &amp; consumers. $26 bn spent on aid to help farmers yet we are nowhere closer to reaching a deal.

As people ran from the burning towers on 9/11 first responders ran towards them. The health of these heroes must be a top priority. To abandon them now in their own time of need would be shameful and profoundly un-American. https://t.co/tZunda7DJO,2019-06-12 13:32:44,Twitter Web Client,22,128
The U.S. cannot continue to be the only developed country in the world without universal healthcare coverage.

3 in 10 U.S. adults report not taking medicines as prescribed at some point in the past year because of high prices.

Tariffs are hurting us at home from farmers to manufacturers and are being passed on to American consumers. Small business owners should not have to worry about a trade war ending what they have worked so hard to build.

Bottom line: Trump's trade tariffs are taxes on the American consumer.  Our farmers are getting hit hard on top of an extremely challenging farm economy and the taxpayer is left with the $28 billion bill for bailouts.  https://t.co/6vjGtrvZ3a,2019-06-04 14:58:51,Twitter Web Client,6,28

A public option is the most effective way to finally get the U.S. to universal health care coverage. We can't afford to wait any longer while people are burdened by outrageous medical bills and forced to take on debt to receive health care. It's time to act by passing Medicare-X.,2019-05-20 17:31:39,Twitter for iPhone,6,24
Medicare-X provides people with a choice. It would start in rural areas where options on the exchange are limited or nonexistent in order to increase competition and lower costs. It would also allow the federal government to negotiate to reduce drug prices.,2019-05-20 17:31:38,Twitter for iPhone,4,22
The U.S. spends nearly 2x what other advanced economies spend on healthcare yet 27 million Americans lack health insurance. Strongly agree with @MichaelBennet that we need a public option.

The fear this family went through is heartbreaking.   We cannot continue being the only developed country in the world without some form of universal healthcare.

Nearly 3000 treasured lives were taken on 9/11. They should never be turned into pawns on a political chess board. Nor should a fellow American and public servant’s life be placed in danger by those appealing to hate rooted in Islamophobia.,2019-04-13 01:26:41,Twitter Web Client,784,4543
I’m sick that anyone let alone the President of the United States would weaponize 9/11 even more so to target a Muslim Member of Congress for political gain. Beyond reckless and morally bankrupt.,2019-04-13 01:26:41,Twitter Web Client,8432,46399

The communities of Hoosick Falls and Petersburgh should not have to worry every time they turn on a tap about whether or not their drinking water contains harmful chemicals.

In a continued attempt to fulfill a purely political promise President Trump vetoed the will of Congress.

I will continue to push the EPA on behalf of those whose lives have been affected by this issue in Hoosick Falls Petersburgh and across the country.,2019-02-18 15:30:51,Twitter for iPhone,5,69
The EPA's choice to slow-walk its actions on PFOA/PFAS contamination is putting people's lives in danger right now. This editorial piece nails the absurdity of waiting to enact real measures so we can all have safe drinking water. https://t.co/BjmU5LTaC5,2019-02-18 15:30:51,Twitter for iPhone,24,87

This persistent undermining of our system of checks and balances including free press our judges the intelligence community and now Congress is demonstrably undemocratic and far too close to authoritarianism.,2019-02-15 17:09:04,Twitter for iPhone,9,48
On top of that we are now met with President Trump’s lawless decision to declare a state of emergency. Such decisions are eroding basic tenants of our democracy from the rule of law to the separation of powers.,2019-02-15 17:09:03,Twitter for iPhone,7,44
Pleased with President Trump’s decision to sign the veto-proof bipartisan funding agreement. But it is nothing short of disgraceful that to get here we had the longest government shutdown in history. The agreement is flawed as a result.,2019-02-15 17:09:03,Twitter for iPhone,5,39
Moreover declaring that the situation on our borders constitutes a state of emergency does not square with legal precedent. Absent a legal basis for such a declaration the President's decision can only be described as a lawless act posing a direct threat to our democratic order,2019-02-15 16:32:27,Twitter for iPhone,18,173
There is no legal or Constitutional basis for the President's use of emergency powers to fund a wall. Congress expressly ruled under its sole Constitutional authority that no such funds be appropriated.,2019-02-15 16:32:26,Twitter for iPhone,89,469
