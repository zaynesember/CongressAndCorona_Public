@CWAUnion @USChamber When the workers in my district show such resolve how can I show any less? We must pass the #PROAct and I will do whatever I can to make that happen. #PROActChat #1u,2019-12-12 18:40:32,Twitter Web App,0,5
@CWAUnion @USChamber A5: I’m reminded of the GM workers in my district who recently went on strike.

In the end their solidarity won out and they were able to win real gains.,2019-12-12 18:37:06,Twitter Web App,0,2
@CWAUnion @USChamber A5: This effort is only a drop in the bucket - employers spend an estimated $340 million per year on union-busting consultants. That’s why this fight is so important. In the face of such opposition we cannot waver in our support for the workers on the front lines. #PROActChat,2019-12-12 18:35:22,Twitter Web App,1,3
@CWAUnion @USChamber A5: Quite simply they’re afraid. They’re afraid of workers having a real voice in the workplace. They’re afraid of the power solidarity wields to raise the standard of living for all. And they’re afraid of creating a more equitable system where labor is rewarded for their work.,2019-12-12 18:34:34,Twitter Web App,2,3
@CWAUnion A4: The #PROAct also removes a longstanding impediment to free speech – the ban on secondary boycotts. Removing this ban allows workers everywhere to come together in solidarity and show their support by refusing to cross a picket line. #PROActChat,2019-12-12 18:29:50,Twitter Web App,2,5

@CWAUnion A2: By making it easier to organize without fear of retaliation setting a clear path to a first contract and protecting the right to strike the #PROAct empowers workers to use their voice.

@CWAUnion A2: From better wages and health care to providing due process in the workplace and a healthier work-life balance unions are proven to build better workplaces.

@CWAUnion A1: Because the #PROAct is vital to rebuilding our middle-class! We’ve seen productivity ⬆️ yet real wages are stagnant.

Betsy DeVos’s proposal to eliminate funding for the Special Olympics happened on Trump’s watch.

Precedent: Special counsel reports on allegations of wrongdoing by a president are released in full to Congress.   Unprecedented: A president’s political appointee releases only his interpretation of the report.   #ReleaseTheFullReport Mr. Barr.,2019-03-25 14:25:01,Twitter Web Client,57,113

Unfortunately we have waited until the 11th hour to take this seriously enough to have any hope of keeping global warming to less than 1.5 degrees Celsius which itself will inflict massive and problematic changes on the planet. (4/8),2019-02-07 20:01:33,Twitter Web Client,1,3

THREAD: There’s no way we can move fast enough or comprehensively enough to address climate change unless we unite all progressive forces. That’s why I’m proud to be an original cosponsor of the Green New Deal resolution. (1/8),2019-02-07 20:01:32,Twitter Web Client,4,43
The fact that I had to ask whether @realDonaldTrump’s personal conflicts of interest are affecting his foreign policy decisions is scary. The answer was even scarier. https://t.co/OTuL08nOLl,2019-02-07 14:58:58,Twitter Web Client,8,13

Excited to join @RepColinAllred &amp; @RepSpanberger for our first @HouseForeign hearing on U.S. policy in the Arabian Peninsula. This discussion is long overdue. We must change course to save innocent lives in Yemen &amp; hold Saudi Arabia accountable for its human rights record. https://t.co/9DgbuqKQ5N,2019-02-06 15:56:40,Twitter for iPhone,12,52

SOTU = empty calories. I feel like I just ate a bunch of potato chips Twinkies and pop tarts.,2019-02-06 04:36:13,Twitter for iPhone,7,98
@POTUS trotted out one tear-jerking &amp; patriotic story after another. They were touching but where was the *policy* to help our kids protect seniors or advance freedom &amp; justice? It’s all symbolism. Empty calories. Not to mention totally divorced from his track record.,2019-02-06 03:39:14,Twitter for iPhone,1,5
I can’t believe I’m here listening to the POTUS champion a new nuclear arms race bragging that we will outspend all others. That’s a prescription for disaster. I hope I can contribute toward a more peaceful direction from the @HouseForeign Asia and Nonproliferation subcommittee.,2019-02-06 03:14:09,Twitter for iPhone,51,157
It feels sickening to sit here — as a two-time cancer survivor — and listen to a man who has repeatedly proposed cutting the National Institutes of Health budget use the story of a child cancer survivor for applause.

The President’s agenda has been failing middle class families for two years. Tonight he’ll try to pretend otherwise. We need an economy that works for everybody not just the people who are already at the top. The President just doesn’t seem to understand that. #SOTU,2019-02-05 17:30:21,Twitter Web Client,14,47
I love everything about this @gretchenwhitmer: the name the leader the consolidating and lifting up of clean water and clean energy in one smart package—at once a hyper-urgent moral imperative and a tremendous economic opportunity.

Tomorrow I will be joined at the SOTU by @UAW Local 909 President Ghana Goodwin-Dye. There's nothing more important to me as a person as a Michigander and as a member of Congress than protecting the rights and dignity of hardworking people like Ghana and her fellow members. https://t.co/rW4wMlo92f,2019-02-04 21:31:50,Twitter Web Client,2,17
The U.S. should be pushing hard for a multilateral effort to keep Russia moving in the right direction on arms control.

Fellow Michiganders in #MI09 PLEASE remember to turn down your thermostat if you can stand it so that everyone can have heat.

Mexico posted its highest ever trade surplus with the U.S. — $1800000000 for December. Doesn’t seem like Trump’s NAFTA 1.5 is going to help American workers! https://t.co/Qs32dIY6CO,2019-01-30 14:22:00,Twitter Web Client,1,2
More good news: I was named to the @HouseForeign subcommittee on Asia the Pacific and Nonproliferation &amp; the subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere Civilian Security and Trade.

The CBO estimates that President Trump’s shutdown did $11 billion in damage to the economy.

It’s Day 34 of the senseless Trump-McConnell shutdown and also the eve of another payless payday for hundreds of thousands of federal workers.

As angry as I am about the #TrumpShutdown I am inspired in equal measure by the reaction of people in #MI09 like @OakGovMeisner and @davidwcoulter who want to help impacted federal workers.

We must redouble our efforts to support equality for transgender Americans so they can serve work and live with dignity.

As we celebrate #MLKDay let us redouble our efforts to meet hate with love and confront injustice and racism.

Imagine negotiating with someone who steals your car and your TV set and then offers to return them to you as a “compromise." It was Donald Trump who ended DACA and TPS.
