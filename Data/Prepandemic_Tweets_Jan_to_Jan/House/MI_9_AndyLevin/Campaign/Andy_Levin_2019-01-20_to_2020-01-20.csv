I’m so ready for “our moment in history when no one is left on the sidelines.” You have motivated me so much tonight @ewarren! I’m ready to hit the campaign trail to elect our first woman president — and our greatest since FDR. #DemocraticDebate,2020-01-15 04:14:34,Twitter for iPhone,18,101
I simply love how @ewarren doesn’t just propose free universal child care and pre-K but also raising compensation for the workers. All of us parents know how underpaid early childhood caregivers and teachers are. #DemocraticDebate,2020-01-15 03:26:48,Twitter for iPhone,307,2200
The 2020 national spotlight is on the counties I represent especially Macomb and that is why I endorsed @ewarren. Her analysis of corporate corruption ruining our country rings true to my working class constituents. She can win Macomb County Michigan and the White House.,2020-01-15 03:16:52,Twitter for iPhone,82,429
I feel it in my bones: @ewarren will be sworn in as the first woman president of the United States 372 days from right now.  I want to be there! She’s the whole package: tough smart progressive well-spoken an American original. #DemocraticDebate,2020-01-15 03:04:00,Twitter for iPhone,1353,11119
“A Democrat we can all believe in.” That’s @ewarren!!! #DemocraticDebate,2020-01-15 02:49:54,Twitter for iPhone,8,39

.@ewarren is so right. We must stop asking brave soldiers to solve problems that can’t be solved militarily. We need to focus on diplomacy and bring our combat troops home. #DemDebate,2020-01-15 02:22:39,Twitter for iPhone,76,395

Per the Constitution only Congress can authorize the use of military force. I hope the growing speculation is wrong that this strike may serve as a means to distract from the very serious matter of impeachment — an impeachment based in large part on defying the Constitution.,2020-01-03 22:46:09,Twitter for iPhone,3,20

Folks work as temps for years with no assurance of reaching permanent status or decent wages and permanent workers wait up to 3000 days to get full pay - even on the second tier! So long Generous Motors.,2019-10-13 16:58:40,Twitter for iPhone,0,2
Production workers used to get to full pay after 90 days and it was a wage you could raise a family on with good benefits too. Now? GM keeps a divisive two-tier pay scale.,2019-10-13 16:58:19,Twitter for iPhone,1,4
.@GM used to be called Generous Motors for negotiating contracts with the @UAW that literally built the American middle class. In the 21st Century forcing its loyal workers out on strike for weeks on end it’s #GrinchMotors all the way. #1u #GMStrike https://t.co/2M95G87qSf,2019-10-13 16:57:58,Twitter for iPhone,7,14
The spirit tonight was tremendous and I just can’t believe the commitment of veteran @GM workers to help their temporary worker brothers and sisters. It’s a theme in every picket line I join that the abuse of the temp system poisons their work culture. @UAW #1u #Solidarity https://t.co/buFPNHCFfw,2019-10-11 23:01:26,Twitter for iPhone,8,28
A solution for temporary workers and wage increases are essential and non-negotiable. @GM must bring a fair deal to the negotiating table without delay. @UAW members have worked too hard for too long to be denied dignity in the workplace. #1u https://t.co/R7QEk62Viu,2019-10-07 20:08:11,Twitter for iPhone,3,7
It’s no wonder @UAW members feel betrayed by @GM. The UAW helped prop up the company during the auto industry collapse by making big concessions in wages &amp; benefits. It’s past time for GM to restore the concessions &amp; give UAW members a fair contract. #1u  https://t.co/uY1dekGjI6,2019-10-04 15:32:09,Twitter for iPhone,1,6
On Day 17 of their strike for all American workers I stand in solidarity with my @UAW brothers and sisters as they demand that @GM provide good health care and benefits wage increases a plan to fix the temp worker scam and a commitment to build more product in the US. #1u,2019-10-02 17:40:31,Twitter for iPhone,4,19

I'm hopeful that @GM is ready to negotiate in good faith with the @UAW to deliver the wages benefits and workplace rights that workers deserve and finally end this strike. #StandWithUs #1u https://t.co/8hio7CdWos,2019-09-25 22:29:01,Twitter for iPhone,3,6

Momentum is on our side.
