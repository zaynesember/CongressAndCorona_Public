H.R. 3 allows the @HHSGov secretary to negotiate lower drug prices; extends Medicare coverage to include dental vision and hearing; caps Medicare out-of-pocket costs for seniors and people with disabilities; reinvests the billions of dollars saved into public health and more.,2019-12-12 19:31:07,Twitter Web App,4,14
But right now most cancer medications cost more than $100000 each year. That’s simply too expensive—and 90% of Americans agree. We took action today to lower the costs of medications and treatment and stop drug companies from ripping off American patients.,2019-12-12 19:31:07,Twitter Web App,2,11
Today the House took a bold step toward lowering the cost of prescription drugs for all Americans.

The bipartisan Farm Workforce Modernization Act is good for Arizona’s economy—where agribusiness contributes $23.3 billion annually. I voted YES to make it easier for Arizona farmers to meet their workforce needs and provide a path for agriculture workers to earn legal status.,2019-12-11 23:35:05,Twitter Web App,7,20

Worse yet this new restriction will also disproportionately affect Native American and rural residents in our state. It ignores the unique economic challenges in rural communities and on Tribal lands and puts those populations at greater risk. And the Administration isn't done.,2019-12-05 21:39:39,Twitter Web App,2,14
Heightened work requirements for SNAP recipients does not lower unemployment rates and does not help anyone find a job. It simply takes away a vital benefit from the most vulnerable in our community. It also strips states' rights to establish their own requirements and standards.,2019-12-05 21:39:39,Twitter Web App,1,10
The Trump Administration made a decision this week that will cause hundreds of thousands of Americans to lose government food benefits--including at least 6700 Arizonans.

Thank you! https://t.co/30CU147kit,2019-02-13 21:18:21,Twitter Web Client,2,15
Seeing #PWD employed at @TCHArizona through @AbilityOne75 and @SAAdvocacy is a poignant reminder of the potential of people with disabilities. Enjoyed learning more last week about how TCH empowers #PWD with employment opportunities and choices! https://t.co/AGDSXws4cj,2019-02-13 20:56:08,Twitter Web Client,1,5
.@CloseUp_DC empowers students and teachers from across the country to find their voice in our democracy. It was great to meet these young leaders from Arizona and hear their plans for college and beyond. Their futures are bright! https://t.co/OipydwoTXq,2019-02-13 19:32:07,Twitter for iPhone,1,13
We may not be able to #EndGunViolence overnight but we can take action today by moving #HR8 one step closer to the House floor. Our @HouseJudiciary Committee will mark up the bill on universal background checks—long overdue action to stop guns from getting into the wrong hands.,2019-02-13 15:14:05,Twitter for iPhone,27,68
What an honor to attend tonight’s @specialolympics reception. I got to introduce Connor Cole the most decorated olympian in Cortez High School history (my alma mater). He’s making us proud. https://t.co/yJOY8JuREE,2019-02-13 00:06:17,Twitter for iPhone,3,14
Today I met with David Skarphol from @NATCA to discuss the shutdown's impact on air traffic controllers at @PHXSkyHarbor. We agree: The #shutdown impacted our safety and held hundreds of thousands of workers’ paychecks and well-being hostage. We can't afford another one. https://t.co/9UP2QoyV3v,2019-02-12 17:57:49,Twitter for iPhone,2,9

Happening now: We’re examining the state of our nation’s infrastructure and the cost of ignoring growing needs. Glad my friend @ericgarcetti is here today representing cities on an issue that has been a top priority for mayors—and now this Congress. https://t.co/PfIf3ZKwuN,2019-02-07 17:31:14,Twitter for iPhone,1,10

This week @TransportDems will have our first hearing on the #CostOfInaction—to take a close look at the current state of our nation’s infrastructure needs and the consequences of ignoring them. You bet I’m going to stand up for investment in Arizona. https://t.co/U6t8axtQCU,2019-02-05 02:40:15,Twitter for iPhone,5,14
There is real opportunity for the President to appeal to the better angels of our nature and make finding a solution for DREAMers a top priority during his #SOTU. Read more: https://t.co/zOMYUkIauA,2019-02-04 18:36:51,Twitter for iPhone,2,12
My friend and DACA recipient Ellie Perez will be my guest at Tuesday's State of the Union Address. Ellie is a reminder to all of us in Congress—and to President Trump—that our nation will be stronger when we pass immigration reform that fully embraces DREAMers as Americans.,2019-02-01 22:09:57,Twitter for iPhone,34,201
Great to visit with so many friends from home this week. Both @head_az and @AzSBA stopped by to talk about their priorities for the year—two groups committed to giving our kids the tools they need to thrive in school. https://t.co/YYQ5BIVXzj,2019-02-01 02:58:54,Twitter for iPhone,2,15
1 in 3 young people grow up without a mentor—let’s change that. Thanks to the team from @MENTORnational for stopping by to talk about investing in quality youth mentoring. We’ll hang up our @FreeArtsAZ artwork as a daily reminder to support the next generation of leaders. https://t.co/Ue8qbCC7YV,2019-01-30 22:08:23,Twitter for iPhone,1,8
The #PaycheckFairness Act will ban retaliation against workers who ask about pay; require employers to prove pay disparities exist for job-related reasons only; support wronged employees; improve @USDOL's enforcement tools; support businesses with best practices and more.,2019-01-30 15:21:46,Twitter Web Client,0,4
56 years after the Equal Pay Act pay discrimination is still very real. Women make only 80 cents for every $1 a man earns and the gap is wider for women of color. I'm proud to cosponsor the #PaycheckFairness Act an important step forward for women families and our economy.,2019-01-30 15:21:46,Twitter Web Client,7,19
Our first @HouseJudiciary hearing on #HR1 the #ForThePeople Act is happening now. The first step to restoring confidence in our democracy and integrity in our government.  Watch live: https://t.co/kq8Kg3Mdh5,2019-01-29 16:40:10,Twitter for iPhone,4,12
The annual @uamedphx #Connect2STEM gives young people an up-close look at careers in science and technology. I’m inspired by the volunteers who put together this event to give so many students their first exposure to STEM opportunities in college and beyond. #azscitech https://t.co/5hpiUFE685,2019-01-26 17:35:28,Twitter for iPhone,7,31
Over the weekend I met with nonprofit leaders in Arizona who work with victims of domestic violence. Their federal funding is critical and without it some are being forced to turn people away. This shutdown is hurting our most vulnerable—it has to end. https://t.co/Ja5SFmNfXd,2019-01-24 19:41:53,Twitter for iPhone,6,11
Thank you to the individuals who joined me this afternoon and spoke so openly and honestly. Thank you for continuing to care and serve even in the toughest conditions. We are indebted to the work you and countless others do every day.,2019-01-22 01:30:28,Twitter for iPhone,2,10
I’m headed back to Washington tomorrow to share these stories and advocate for the people I heard from today—and the hundreds of thousands of others impacted by this needless shutdown. There’s just no way around it we have to get our government working again. https://t.co/SgzRDSs0BC,2019-01-22 01:29:47,Twitter for iPhone,0,11
But they also shared with me their new stark reality: Coming home with no paycheck in sight is hurting their families. Some are considering paying penalties to dip into retirement. Others are concerned about accessing their health care benefits. The effects are serious and real. https://t.co/O4FRQ7dDjc,2019-01-22 01:28:15,Twitter for iPhone,0,4
Despite the furloughs despite the low morale for those forced to work without pay—many of these individuals were most upset that the shutdown has stalled or halted the critical services they provide the American people. https://t.co/Fh2TkbV8HO,2019-01-22 01:25:37,Twitter for iPhone,0,5
Several employees and service providers are looking ahead and realizing that the shutdown will disrupt their work plans and budgets for the rest of the year. The consequences they fear will fall back to our residents: from forgone airport safety trainings to wildfire prevention. https://t.co/VoPZOtOBqL,2019-01-22 01:24:41,Twitter for iPhone,0,6
This afternoon I met with more than a dozen Arizonans affected by the government shutdown. Each described to me the ways in which they feel held hostage each day this shutdown continues—their stories were both heartbreaking and frustrating. https://t.co/IWRc0JHyJY,2019-01-22 01:22:20,Twitter for iPhone,10,32
Next week I will once again vote to re-open the government. We will continue to put forward constructive reasonable and bipartisan solutions to end the shutdown and get our government working again for the American people.,2019-01-20 16:44:31,Twitter for iPhone,4,24
Nearly 90 percent of @DHSgov employees—those on the front lines—are working without pay. 53000 TSA employees 54000 ICE officers and 42000 Coast Guard active duty members. It’s immoral and it puts our safety at risk.,2019-01-20 16:43:55,Twitter for iPhone,3,13
The @USEEOC—the agency that makes sure employees are protected from race sex religion sexual orientation or gender discrimination—is closed. Mediations have been cancelled and pending cases are being suspended.,2019-01-20 16:43:17,Twitter for iPhone,2,6
Thousands of federal employees responsible for enforcing public health safety consumer rights and environmental laws are on furlough. Food safety is at risk and the shutdown is creating a backlog of approvals for new innovative prescription drugs and medical devices.,2019-01-20 16:42:32,Twitter for iPhone,0,5
E-Verify has been unavailable during the shutdown which means more than 750000 private sector employers who rely on the service can’t use it to hire new workers and fill jobs. That’s just plain harmful to our economy.,2019-01-20 16:41:36,Twitter for iPhone,3,7
Most immigration judges are on furlough. Cases are essentially frozen. Our courts are already facing a massive backlog of 800000+ pending cases with new ones now rescheduled several years out. Considering the president’s posture on border security this disruption is absurd.,2019-01-20 16:36:24,Twitter for iPhone,1,7
Grant payments from @TheJusticeDept are now in jeopardy. Domestic violence shelters across the nation—many of which rely on federal grant funds each month—could struggle to keep their doors open and be forced to turn away women and children.,2019-01-20 16:35:53,Twitter for iPhone,4,10
We’re about to enter the second month of this needless shutdown. Tomorrow I’ll meet with people in AZ who are directly feeling the negative impacts. But I want to take a moment to share how the shutdown’s effect on law enforcement and safety organizations is hurting people.,2019-01-20 16:34:55,Twitter for iPhone,23,80
