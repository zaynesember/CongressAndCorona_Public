I was so proud to have the opportunity to march in the Fox Valley #WomensMarch2020. We have made great progress in the fight for women’s equality but we cannot settle. Our voices are louder together!,2020-01-19 02:15:04,Twitter Web App,3,9
I added my name to a letter calling on the Dept. of Education to put a stop to the use of isolated timeouts.  It is appalling that children are being treated this way with such blatant disregard for their physical and mental health.    https://t.co/juTxHxtMzF,2020-01-18 02:39:20,Twitter Web App,3,4
I and my fellow colleagues in the House carefully listen and weighed the evidence before voting to #impeach the President. I can only hope the newly sworn in Senate jurors do the same. I urge the Senate to call witnesses and hear the new evidence! https://t.co/7nrScleOM0,2020-01-17 02:05:49,Twitter Web App,3,7
Article 2 of the Articles of Impeachment refer to obstructing this Congressional investigation and I think that what we’re seeing from Lev Parnas is proof that obstruction occurred.  https://t.co/xlqKVQxJTC,2020-01-16 01:08:42,Twitter Web App,2,5
We cannot go to war with Iran. And the actions of the President put us on a dangerous path towards another war in the Middle-East. We need to understand the true motives behind this attack. https://t.co/EexE89lyG3,2020-01-15 02:54:19,Twitter Web App,3,2
Today along with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle I voted to curb President Trump's ability to launch us into a war with Iran. Instead we underlined Congress' war powers. My priority is and has always been keeping the American people safe and out of harms way.,2020-01-10 03:28:51,Twitter Web App,4,5

It is imperative that we take all steps necessary to protect our forces &amp; personnel against the reprisals and threats to come.

I voted to impeach President Trump last night. President Trump abused his power. He threatened our democracy and obstructed Congress. He compromised our election and national security. I swore an oath to protect the constitution and that is what I did last night.,2019-12-19 18:56:41,Twitter Web App,7,27
The meteoric rise in youth vaping has created a national public health crisis. If we need to educate on the dangers of vaping. If we do it now we have a chance of arresting this epidemic. And we have to do it immediately.  https://t.co/8QCX5D6tN3,2019-12-18 21:35:24,Twitter Web App,2,2

It seems we can no longer rely on the manufacturer's safety assurances. Johnson &amp; Johnson told us for decades their baby powder was safe but it wasn't.

The President's behavior during these #impeachmenthearings is very troubling.
