@BillyVonElds Ah. The ad hominem attack. Always a sign....,2019-04-23 01:03:14,Twitter for iPad,0,1
@williamg1 @MEPFuller That is a fair point. It is possible. We should consider that too.,2019-04-23 00:59:36,Twitter for iPad,0,2
@Juliess31 @MEPFuller Thought experiment: Let’s stipulate that Trump will not be removed by impeachment. And let’s stipulate the possibility that impeachment meaningfully increases his chance of re-election (something I don’t know right now). What do you do?,2019-04-23 00:58:52,Twitter for iPad,1,2
@ryannicholos @MEPFuller No. Which is why that particular function rests in the judiciary not the legislature. But prosecutors make charge/no charge decisions every single day.,2019-04-23 00:56:26,Twitter for iPad,0,1
@MissingLynx @MEPFuller Not exactly what I’m saying. Historically Congress has impeached and will again. But nothing in the constitution forces Congress to impeach in a given circumstance. If you disagree send me the language that forces Congress to do so.,2019-04-23 00:55:06,Twitter for iPad,0,3
@MEPFuller Where Matt do I say it is “all political”? Seriously. I am a huge defender of the press. But it’s hard to do that when I take the time to engage with you and you mistate my argument. Or talk about my “look”. Are you trying to get at the truth here or to stir the pot?,2019-04-23 00:52:19,Twitter for iPad,0,23

@MEPFuller There is no explicit duty as there is conduct a census every 10 years. Congress decides if and when to impeach independent of the words of the constitution. That’s not controversial. It’s true. So it’s not unreasonable to try to understand where American sentiment is in deciding.,2019-04-23 00:44:07,Twitter for iPad,1,13
@MEPFuller Lordy. It’s not about a look. Duty is in quotes because the constitution imposes absolutely no obligation to impeach under any circumstance. It’s at the discretion of Congress. Kinda feels like you’re looking for a lot more fireworks than you’re going to find in this quarter.,2019-04-23 00:34:59,Twitter for iPad,1,33
@MEPFuller Like everything else a legislator does there’s a mix of “knowing” and what public sentiment demands. Especially in the House where we are called “Representative”. Impeachment could have been granted to SCOTUS but instead it was given to the part of our gov closest to people.,2019-04-23 00:31:14,Twitter for iPad,1,3
@MEPFuller I don’t think there’s an opposition between the two in this case. Impeachment is by design a political act not a judicial or legal one. So public sentiment is as essential (probably more) as any implicit constitutional “duty”.,2019-04-23 00:26:26,Twitter for iPad,0,16
@MEPFuller Anyway I was making an argument for care and consideration of facts and implications in however we choose to act. I expressed no view on how we should act.,2019-04-23 00:24:08,Twitter for iPad,0,2
@MEPFuller I made the case because along with the will of my constituents that would be something I would want to know before developing intense conviction. You know be as informed as possible before acting?,2019-04-23 00:21:43,Twitter for iPad,0,2
@MEPFuller I don’t know what you heard but I wasn’t forceful about not impeaching Trump (your words). I was forceful about making sure we had the best picture possible of how impeachment plays in Presidential swing states. Something I don’t know. See the diff?,2019-04-23 00:20:26,Twitter for iPad,0,16
@MEPFuller Which is different than “tamping down” the possibility of impeachment.,2019-04-23 00:17:01,Twitter for iPad,0,3
@MEPFuller No it wasn’t. Jim Himes argued that we should reflect on and consider the effect of impeachment proceedings on the chances of the President’s re-election without prejudice. Because if he is not convicted by the Senate 2020 is the next mechanism of accountability.,2019-04-23 00:15:47,Twitter for iPad,2,20

@pwnedlib @gelliottmorris Also a logical fallacy. The thing about defending the truth is that it’s most important to do when it is unpopular to do so. Comfort with convenient untruths is the fuel for con men and sophists.,2019-01-30 22:30:06,Twitter for iPad,0,5
