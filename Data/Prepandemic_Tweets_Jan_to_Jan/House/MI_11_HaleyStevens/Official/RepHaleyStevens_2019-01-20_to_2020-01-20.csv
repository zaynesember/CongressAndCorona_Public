Honored to have been visited by Mayor Bryan Barnett from my hometown of Rochester Hills and the rest of the team. How fitting! The first mayor from #MI11 to visit our D.C. office! Looking forward to doing great things together. https://t.co/h9hc9nRBt9,2019-01-25 23:37:24,Twitter Web Client,4,40
I am relieved that federal employees can finally return to work and receive their paychecks. I will fight to ensure that a permanent solution is agreed upon and that we never have a government shutdown again.,2019-01-25 21:44:59,Twitter for iPhone,8,57
The reported deal to fund the federal government through February 15th is welcome news to the hundreds of thousands of federal workers who have been furloughed or working without pay and the millions of Americans who have been harmed by this reckless shutdown.,2019-01-25 21:44:57,Twitter for iPhone,9,55

Happening now: Dozens of @HouseDemocrats on the floor speaking out on the shutdown imploring the Senate to reopen the government and sharing important #ShutdownStories   I’ll be sharing one soon - tune in! @cspan,2019-01-24 21:26:22,Twitter for iPhone,94,427
This Administration clearly does not understand or appreciate our federal workforce. Our public servants come from all walks of life and they make sacrifices every day to serve the American people. They deserve better and so do your tax dollars. https://t.co/tfiHFhzMwE,2019-01-24 16:58:11,Twitter Web Client,16,91

Tonight I voted in favor of the Hack Your State Department Act (H.R. 328). This crucial bill introduced by my friend @tedlieu would strengthen Department of State cybersecurity by better identifying vulnerabilities. This will make us safer at home and abroad.,2019-01-23 00:21:12,Twitter for iPhone,38,197
This is abhorrent. Transgender Americans have made invaluable contributions to our nation through their military service. Banning transgender people from our military is not only immoral it is a disservice to our country. https://t.co/oxcg1eF4pA,2019-01-22 19:25:45,Twitter Web Client,42,198
