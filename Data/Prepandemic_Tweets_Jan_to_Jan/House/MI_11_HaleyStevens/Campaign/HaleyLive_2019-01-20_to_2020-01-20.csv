We as a society will get what we pay for and what we do not to pay for.   When we invest in education by valuing the profession we’re supporting the best outcomes for our students &amp; their families.  And the best people are encouraged to become teachers.  Let’s start doing that.,2019-12-04 17:35:03,Twitter for iPhone,8,41
Too often I talk with educators police officers firemen &amp; women who are being squeezed pushed to the brink &amp; leaving the profession because they aren’t compensated properly for their work.

This is it. Spot on.   Over Thanksgiving I met a veteran in Afghanistan who is now a contractor with the State Department. He tried teaching after serving but said the job didn’t pay the bills.
