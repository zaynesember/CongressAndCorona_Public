Senate Republicans would be doing a great service to the country and restore confidence if they conducted a real trial &amp; tried to get direct evidence House didn’t.

Some claim impeachment w/o removal is punishment but expected Senate outcome would give Trump  opportunity to claim complete vindication.

This bill is a step in the right direction but it’s not perfect. That’s why I’ve offered an amendment to guarantee price negotiation on ALL life-sustaining Rx.

This could get the total cost of a breast cancer drug like Ibrance down from $69000 to $23900 annually. Another example: diabetes patients could spend 3.5x less on insulin under the bill than before.

The ACA has shortcomings that need to be fixed but one provision that must remain is the protection of individuals with #preexistingconditions.

Experts attribute the decline in part to actions by the Trump administration to undermine the #ACA including the decision to eliminate “cost share reduction” payments.

Talked infrastructure w/ @morningsmaria before officially taking over as chair of the House Transpo &amp; Infrastructure Committee’s Subcommittee on Railroads Pipelines &amp; Hazmat. Look forward to working on bipartisan solutions to address our massive infrastructure investment needs. https://t.co/BgWt7fOiRZ,2019-02-08 01:48:57,Twitter for iPhone,1,1
I repeat. @epa shut @sterigenics1 down now. https://t.co/TXznqLOPGy,2019-02-08 00:58:59,Twitter for iPhone,17,39
It’s time to open up the market for Rx drug prices. We need more pricing transparency to drive down the cost of Rx drugs for seniors &amp; families across America.

First panel of first House Transportation &amp; #Infrastructure Committee hearing. 2 of the witnesses are good friends @GovTimWalz (MN) &amp; former US Transpo Sec. @RayLaHood.

I'll be on @MorningsMaria tomorrow discussing the #sotu infrastructure and other topics. Tune in to @foxbusiness at 8 a.m. ET.,2019-02-07 04:38:08,Twitter Web Client,0,7
My call to shutdown @sterigenics1 was mentioned in this ABC7 story. We need to keep the pressure on @epa. I'm glad the chorus of state &amp; federal officials joining me calling for the shutdown is growing. The more data we see the worse the situation looks. https://t.co/Gj1BmKW1fE,2019-02-07 03:14:51,Twitter Web Client,9,18
"We must choose whether we are defined by our differences -- or whether we dare to transcend them." Let's hope the president and all in Washington together live and work by these words for the good of all the American people. It would be a welcome change. #sotu,2019-02-06 03:45:16,Twitter for iPhone,1,16

On Thurs the House Transportation &amp; Infrastructure Committee which I serve on as Rail Subcommittee chairman will hold a hearing on the cost of doing nothing and why investing in our trillion-dollar infrastructure backlog cannot wait. #sotu,2019-02-06 02:59:41,Twitter for iPhone,0,4
I appreciate #potus calling on Congress to produce an infrastructure package that invests in vital national projects. However we need more than lip service. We need funding so we can ease congestion on roads improve public transportation &amp; fix crumbling infrastructure. #sotu,2019-02-06 02:57:25,Twitter for iPhone,2,13
Both parties in Congress SHOULD be working for effective nonpartisan oversight and investigations. That hasn’t been happening but that’s the way our government is supposed to work. Checks and balances. #sotu,2019-02-06 02:42:57,Twitter for iPhone,2,13
If only the president would follow his grandiose words with action working together for the American people. #sotu,2019-02-06 02:32:00,Twitter for iPhone,1,22

Today’s @EPA data shows that the EtO levels around the Sterigenics facilities in Willowbrook are well over the EPA action threshold for cancer risk. One result was 350 times the threshold. It is time for EPA to immediately shut the facilities down. https://t.co/rIVL7ofp7Z,2019-02-05 22:57:20,Twitter for iPhone,13,28
My #SOTU guest tomorrow is @Chicago_Police officer Gino Garcia. Gino was 6 when domestic violence tragically ended his mother’s life.

I base this call on the air testing EPA has already conducted and made this clear to Sterigenics executives when we met last week.,2019-02-04 23:49:11,Twitter Web Client,1,6
This story makes several allegations that if confirmed are incredibly disturbing. I will continue to hold @Sterigenics1 accountable and will not relent in calling for the @EPA to shut down the plant unless they can prove that it is not a health threat. https://t.co/BlKyWN2lWW,2019-02-04 23:48:21,Twitter Web Client,5,20
@AlexParker I’ve reached out to Metra for an explanation. Like you I am beyond frustrated.,2019-02-04 23:35:53,Twitter for iPhone,0,5

The only way I’ll back off calling for an EPA shut down is if such testing is conducted and it backs their claim.  They have not moved forward on this. Today I reiterated this. 4 of 4,2019-01-30 04:26:18,Twitter for iPhone,5,7
Six weeks ago I told Sterigenics they should begin perimeter testing as the only way to prove their claim they are not emitting a significant amount of EtO into the community. 3 of 4,2019-01-30 04:25:03,Twitter for iPhone,2,4
. @epa has not heeded my request to shut down Sterigenics based on EPA air tests that indicated high level of ethylene oxide in Willowbrook. 2 of 4,2019-01-30 04:23:19,Twitter for iPhone,8,11
Today I met w @Sterigenics1’s CEO &amp; president &amp; requested that they host a public meeting w/ impacted residents ASAP. They did not indicate a willingness to do so at this time. 1 of 4 https://t.co/X51pXMof9u,2019-01-30 04:21:46,Twitter for iPhone,11,7
I signed on to cosponsor legislation to enact an automatic continuing resolution at the previous year’s funding levels in the event Congress fails to pass an appropriations bill. No more shutdowns. Federal employees and their families deserve better. https://t.co/ai0wzHUVAD,2019-01-30 03:44:53,Twitter Web Client,5,16
@LOYURGRL @N4EJchicago @StopEtOLC @Sterigenics1 @StopSterigenics @CleanAirIL I completely understand. I should have provided more context in my original tweet. I am very sorry for what everyone who lives near Sterigenics has been going through and can assure you I am on your side.,2019-01-29 16:21:58,Twitter for iPhone,0,6
Sterigenics continues to make the claim that the high EtO readings in Willowbrook are not caused by their plants. That’s why I challenged Sterigenics to back up their claim with real data that could come from perimeter testing. So far they’ve done nothing.,2019-01-29 15:58:33,Twitter for iPhone,3,13
@mr_sj_stanczak @Sterigenics1 Give us the data to convince EPA to shut it down,2019-01-29 15:52:23,Twitter for iPhone,0,1
@N4EJchicago @LOYURGRL @StopEtOLC @Sterigenics1 @StopSterigenics @CleanAirIL Please see my clarifying response to initial tweet. I will provide more info after today’s meeting,2019-01-29 15:51:02,Twitter for iPhone,0,2
@jen_mcconahy @Sterigenics1 @EPA @CleanAirIL @StopSterigenics @StopEtOLC Still calling for the shutdown. See my clarifying response to initial tweet,2019-01-29 15:45:47,Twitter for iPhone,0,4
Perimeter testing could provide even more evidence that Sterigenics is not safe and perhaps finally convince EPA to shut it down. That is why I’m calling for it.,2019-01-29 15:23:56,Twitter for iPhone,3,13
I want to clarify that my call for Sterigenics to test the air around their perimeter does not change my position that they need to shut down unless and until they can demonstrate that they are safe.,2019-01-29 15:17:00,Twitter for iPhone,2,15

Tomorrow during meeting w/ @Sterigenics1’s CEO I’ll be calling on him to implement perimeter air quality monitoring so we can have a better sense of how much EtO is coming out of Willowbrook plants.
