This manufactured crisis by the President is quickly becoming a real crisis for millions of Americans.   The President needs to realize the responsibility of the office he holds and open up this government. #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/dfZ2cVK47d,2019-01-25 17:29:42,Twitter Web Client,42,165
Thank you @SenSanders for calling attention to the #StopLine3 movement. This is not just an environmental issue it's an indigenous rights issue. We must stop investing in dirty tar sands pipelines and #KeepItInTheGround. https://t.co/fkopRcBGBX,2019-01-25 14:57:28,Twitter Web Client,864,2612
The wealthiest few in our country have accumulated their wealth through a system that keeps people in poverty. Until we tackle that problem we will never have a full democracy.,2019-01-24 22:34:00,TweetDeck,379,1823

"The average furloughed worker has lost $5600 in wages during the shutdown."  And for what? To fund a wall that represents hate?https://t.co/WysVG6xvFU,2019-01-24 19:13:00,TweetDeck,34,200
Today I’m standing with my sisters @janschakowsky @RepPressley and @RepKatieHill to make sure federal workers can at least afford childcare while the government is shut down. Child care should be a right—not a privilege. https://t.co/NUGsx8egGx,2019-01-24 17:50:21,Twitter for iPhone,537,3586
The same President who called for taking away food stamps away from 2 million people is now jeopardizing food for hundreds of thousands of Minnesotans.   How much longer before we #EndTheShutdown? https://t.co/iiiwjVwrp2,2019-01-24 16:50:43,Twitter Web Client,19,127
This is the same billionaire Trump Administration official who mocked people paying more for food after Trump's tariffs.   Maybe if the President didn't fill his administration with corrupt plutocrats they'd have more sensitivity to people's daily struggles? 🤔 https://t.co/3c7biaqdxS,2019-01-24 15:59:38,Twitter Web Client,62,328
Can't wait to introduce my first bill to make sure families affected by the shutdown have their basic child care needs met. Stay tuned for more details tomorrow! https://t.co/5dPG4av3xV,2019-01-24 01:26:31,Twitter Web Client,77,546
If the shutdown continues until March:  -The Department of Agriculture will not have enough money to fund food stamps for 40 million people.  -The federal court system will grind to a halt.  Is that what the White House wants? https://t.co/C48fsAazGE,2019-01-23 23:34:43,Twitter Web Client,47,160

Voting for the 11th time to reopen the government today:  ❌$0 new money for DHS ❌$0 for border wall ✅ more $ for immigration judges ✅ support for ports of entry  ✅ assistance to Central America  That’s why I’m voting YES and urge my colleagues to do the same.,2019-01-23 19:00:45,Twitter for iPhone,124,815

Honduran Military Police are using US-made M4 assault rifles to kill their citizens. Meanwhile Trump is trying to make it harder for people fleeing this violence to enter our country.  Something is deeply deeply wrong here.  https://t.co/OM66Gfyxhi,2019-01-23 17:41:19,Twitter Web Client,145,254

"The question is not whether we will be extremists but what kind of extremists we will be. Will we be extremists for hate or for love?

We have said from the beginning that we need to work together to reopen the government and THEN have a conversation about reforming our immigration system.   Individual 1 is not making any deal in good faith. #EndtheShutdown https://t.co/TZpTVhj7YK,2019-01-20 17:45:55,Twitter for iPhone,57,333
