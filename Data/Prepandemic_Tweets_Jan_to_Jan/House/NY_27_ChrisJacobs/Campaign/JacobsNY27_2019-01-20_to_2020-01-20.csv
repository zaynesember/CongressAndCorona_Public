Proceeds from this event benefit local veterans organizations. https://t.co/srtO50FkIs,2019-08-18 0:06:40,Twitter for iPhone,0,2
We need to start treating our law enforcement officers with the respect they deserve. This is precisely why I introduced legislation in the NY Senate this month that punishes those who attack our officers with water or other substances with jail time. https://t.co/MJR9nqapcP,2019-08-16 19:30:03,joe.sentry,1,4
@POTUS's agenda is not only creating more jobs but working class wages are starting to rise and the pay gap is shrinking. This is great news for workers in Western New York that rely on these well-paying jobs. https://t.co/WIWKu3xG26,2019-08-15 16:30:06,joe.sentry,0,0
This is another sign that @POTUS's economic agenda is continuing to grow the economy. It's unfortunate that Gov. Cuomo's agenda has held-back our state from benefiting from Trump's policies. After we re-elect Trump we need to kick Cuomo out of New York! https://t.co/IQZVeYG9So,2019-08-13 20:30:06,joe.sentry,0,1
Sunday was Veterans Day at The Erie County Fair. Veterans from across Erie County held a recognition ceremony to honor and thank those who have served our country.

New Yorkers must pay tolls in Canada but right now Canadians don't have to pay tolls on Grand Island Brydges. That's a bad deal! We shouldn't have to pay until it's fixed! https://t.co/FoWNlK5PCh,2019-08-10 0:07:55,Twitter for iPhone,1,1

The terrible treatment experienced by our New York City police officers has to end. I’ve sponsored a bill in the New York Senate to make acts like these a Class E felony. In Congress I’ll fight for our officers all across the nation. #BackTheBlue  https://t.co/ZhgtiWgq3T,2019-08-02 18:34:18,Twitter Web App,0,1
I oppose a windmill farm that will place 50 industrial sized turbines in Lake Erie bordering Hamburg Evans Brant Angola.

.@POTUS has done a tremendous job negotiating the #USMCA trade deal which is slated to generate more jobs across all sectors and strengthen our booming economy. Congress must now put America First and act to ratify it. https://t.co/94KsjXuSix,2019-07-30 13:35:05,joe.sentry,1,0

I spoke against NYS Parole Board releasing a murderer and placing him in WNY. Richard LaBarbera has already been arrested for violating his parole.

This law is offensive to every law abiding citizen and every immigrant who comes into this country legally. My legislation will stop this terrible law before it takes affect. https://t.co/0ewR0Jmj2E,2019-07-25 16:14:11,Twitter for iPhone,1,2
China has taken advantage of an uneven playing field for years. Not anymore. We’ve gotten tough with them on trade and we’re starting to see the positive results.

I'm encouraged by President Trump's leadership on replacing NAFTA which was never a great deal for Western New York. Creating a more level playing field for our farmers and manufacturers should be among our highest priorities. Read my op-ed on #USMCA: https://t.co/uVMe4c2eRN,2019-07-19 18:15:07,joe.sentry,0,1

The Green Light bill which makes drivers licenses available to illegal immigrants is wrong and unconstitutional rewarding those who break our laws.

Almost all the Dem. candidates made two things clear least week: they're for abolishing private health insurance &amp; they're for a border policy that decriminalizes crossing. That's chilling and clarifying. We know what we're up against. https://t.co/7rrCJV1kI7,2019-07-01 12:00:06,joe.sentry,0,2
.@POTUS isn’t wrong. If New Yorkers continue to see their tax burdens increased they’ll find somewhere less burdensome to call home. We can’t allow that to happen. We need a more responsible approach to reduce these heavy tax burdens in our state. https://t.co/K9DNlA12mo,2019-06-27 16:04:23,Twitter Web App,0,0

Those in our country illegally shouldn't be rewarded with driver’s licenses.
