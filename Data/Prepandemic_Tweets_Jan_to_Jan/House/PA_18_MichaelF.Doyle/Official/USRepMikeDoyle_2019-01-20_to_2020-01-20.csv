The Trump Administration is rolling back Obama-era rules that made school lunches healthier.

Yesterday @RepKinzinger and I introduced the Network Security Information Sharing Act which would develop a program to facilitate information sharing between the federal government and companies regarding threats to our cyber networks. https://t.co/1J7N8QB4nA,2019-09-25 19:42:07,Twitter Web App,1,5
Protecting our cybersecurity requires cooperation between the federal government and private sector. One of the most effective steps we can take to prevent cyberattacks is to work closely with the communications sector to eliminate backdoors and supply chain risks.,2019-09-25 19:41:44,Twitter Web App,1,2

Spectrum – the airwaves which carry phone calls Wi-Fi broadcast radio and television – is limited and demand for it is highly competitive. We must ensure the federal government is using its spectrum to maximize innovation and benefits for all Americans.,2019-09-25 18:45:58,Twitter Web App,0,7

Many of our seniors live on a fixed budget and deserve to know that they can afford their prescription drugs. The #LowerDrugCosts Act would cap out-of-pocket spending for the 46 million Medicare beneficiaries at $2000 and strengthen the program for generations. https://t.co/R05A8EeqWq,2019-09-25 17:52:34,Twitter Media Studio,2,3
Americans are struggling to afford the prescription drugs they need. The #LowerDrugCosts Act would allow Medicare to negotiate the prices of prescription drugs and would extend those lower prices to all Americans. We need to get drug companies to the table and drive down costs! https://t.co/6WyE4jBMvz,2019-09-25 17:49:35,Twitter Media Studio,0,5
I joined @SenBobCasey in opposing the Trump Administration’s revisions to SNAP eligibility which threatens food security for children seniors veterans and those with disabilities.

Unions help workers to get the compensation they deserve. It’s outrageous that universities would intentionally restrict this opportunity for their students – and that the Trump Administration condones it. https://t.co/bpds1drtOj,2019-09-20 20:07:31,Twitter Web App,3,6
Graduate students are instructing courses and leading groundbreaking research. They are employees as much as students – and the recent decision that they do not have the right to advocate for fair compensation and rights downplays their valuable contributions to our universities.,2019-09-20 20:07:18,Twitter Web App,8,35

The House just passed H.R. 1423 the FAIR Act to prohibit mandatory arbitration clauses and restore the rights of consumers and workers to sue.

You shouldn't have to sign away your right to a fair trial in order to get a job but corporate contracts often force consumers and employees to settle disputes in private arbitration. This process favors corporations - no judge or jury - and consumers and workers have no choice.,2019-09-20 16:49:56,Twitter Web App,2,17

Declaring a national emergency based on misleading information 1. Discredits the Presidency 2. Undermines the Constitution which gives Congress control over spending 3.
