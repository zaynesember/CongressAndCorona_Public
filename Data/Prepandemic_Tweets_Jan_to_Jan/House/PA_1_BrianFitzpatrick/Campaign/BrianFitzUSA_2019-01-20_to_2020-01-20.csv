Message to @hasanthehun: @DanCrenshawTX is my colleague my friend and an American hero. He’s done something you never have: he put his life on the line to defend our nation and protect your free speech rights. Shame on you for attacking an American hero. https://t.co/8ACY6UVobQ,2019-08-23 12:31:32,Twitter Web App,2,13
“Conservatives have said antifa activists are a dangerous force. On Wednesday Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick sent a letter to Attorney General William P. Barr asking him to designate antifa activists as domestic terrorists and denounce the attack on Ngo” #PA01 https://t.co/WcIauzgkwD,2019-07-21 20:06:38,Twitter Web Client,5,11
To those who undermined law enforcement and our American Flag you have undermined yourselves. The American Flag represents those who died abroad defending your freedoms. The Thin Blue Line flag represents those who died at home protecting your families. https://t.co/5GAfulyILG,2019-07-15 11:45:06,Twitter Web Client,72,76
To each and every one of you from our family to yours Happy Easter. https://t.co/PHzEvfCYwB,2019-04-21 18:24:49,Twitter for iPhone,0,5
