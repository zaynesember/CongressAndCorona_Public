Today I asked Congress to stand for a moment of silence to acknowledge the disenfranchisement of 63 million voters who voted for our president and to #MAGA. Leftists on Twitter whined about it.   They think impeachment helps them. I say — WRONG!  https://t.co/P1S0XDYMHY https://t.co/O7DZR6Je1I,2019-12-18 22:52:53,Twitter Web App,3,6
On Nov. 10 the Cowboys-Vikings game had 23M viewers on NBC. Compare that to the largest TV audience so far for one of the #shamimpeachment hearings-13M on all networks combined.   Americans are seeing through this charade they are tuning it out and they are tired of it.,2019-11-20 23:29:47,Twitter for iPhone,5,5
Wow! What an event last night in Mahoning Co. I was so pleased to be joined by my colleague @DevinNunes  He’s doing a great job - and I know the people there last night at the sold out event agree! https://t.co/T0Jx8y03IA,2019-11-16 17:20:46,Twitter for iPhone,1,6

Planned Parenthood is back at it planning to spend $45 million in this upcoming election cycle. That's a lot of money to invest to further their business model of taking the lives of unborn children and demanding that taxpayers foot the bill.  Sick! https://t.co/cRkJnQ27mx,2019-10-10 14:08:28,Twitter for iPhone,31,11
Thank you all ! https://t.co/Nd50TUy7SI,2019-09-27 22:15:17,Twitter for iPhone,0,3

Great to go to the @CanfieldFair today. Largest county fair in the state. Of course picked up cinnamon rolls from Molnar’s. Saw a lot of people including @GovMikeDeWine #SixBestDaysofSummer https://t.co/Xiptnnq17J,2019-08-30 00:00:13,Twitter for iPhone,0,1

The 2020 #Democrats will stop at nothing to eliminate jobs they don't approve of. Not only would thousands of American men and women be put out of work electricity prices would soar under their plans to eliminate fossil fuels.

Everything about this statement by Senator Gillibrand is disturbing...and wrong. She said referring to those who are pro-life: “we have as a society decided that the other side (pro-life) is not acceptable.”  We did? https://t.co/GLUJUYTxeP,2019-06-13 00:02:40,Twitter for iPhone,0,2
NBC News is compiling a list to see where each Member of Congress stands on impeachment. A local affiliate reached out to me for my position: My answer is straight to the point.   https://t.co/VhpSGETkDD,2019-05-31 18:41:26,Twitter for iPhone,1,0

We've seen this before: rich Hollywood types telling us that we should pay even more in taxes while they're able to pay accountants so their tax liability is as low as possible.  Their hypocrisy is disgusting.   https://t.co/hbbbAN6QGx,2019-04-30 20:03:11,Twitter for iPhone,1,2
Great enthusiastic crowd at tonight’s Jackson County Lincoln Day Dinner. With some local Young Republicans! Thanks to all who attended. https://t.co/g53Fmh9kDp,2019-04-24 02:42:44,Twitter for iPhone,0,3
It's now official - no collusion and no obstruction.  I found the questions and attitude of most of the MSM reporters at AG Barr's press conf to be disgraceful. You could see them getting upset and frustrated as their dreams of the previous 2+ years were going up in smoke.,2019-04-18 17:53:10,Twitter for iPhone,0,4
I'm thrilled that Gov. @MikeDeWine signed the #HeartbeatBill into law - and that he kept his campaign promise to do so. Thank you to all of the Ohio lawmakers and pro-life advocates who took a stand to protect the unborn especially children with beating hearts.,2019-04-12 13:57:28,Twitter for iPhone,0,2

I will sign this petition. Republicans have tried - 20 times - to vote on the Born Alive bill and 20 times House Democrats have blocked it. The American people deserve to know where their elected representatives stand on this life and death issue. https://t.co/NaSPLRwQVl,2019-03-26 18:37:33,Twitter for iPhone,0,0
Welcome to Ohio @realDonaldTrump !,2019-03-20 18:04:44,Twitter for iPhone,0,8
Hustled home from votes in Washington to get to the annual Lincoln Day Dinner in Meigs Co. It's always an enthusiastic crowd and tonight was no different. I heard over and over again from folks to keep supporting @realDonaldTrump and his agenda!,2019-03-15 01:25:48,Twitter for iPhone,0,8
May 2011 President Obama: "We just can't drill our way out of the problem."  Well it turns out not only that we can but that we have. https://t.co/aaTtZ1QHAR,2019-03-10 17:21:16,Twitter for iPhone,1,4
Even respected journalists are drinking the Kool-Aid the far left has been selling since @realDonaldTrump was sworn in. Idea: before Democrats start developing 2020 conspiracy theories+throwing out baseless allegations maybe they should accept results of the 2016 election first. https://t.co/XZ2FCMmmM4,2019-03-05 19:35:38,Twitter for iPhone,1,3
