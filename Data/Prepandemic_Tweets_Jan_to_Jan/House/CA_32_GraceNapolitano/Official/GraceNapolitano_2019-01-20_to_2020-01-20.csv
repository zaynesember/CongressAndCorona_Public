Congress refused to give President Trump $ to build his wall so he threw a tantrum and declared a #FakeEmergency.

I will keep fighting for commonsense solutions to keep our communities safe and prevent tragedies caused by gun violence while strengthening mental health services in this country.,2019-02-27 23:07:58,Twitter for iPhone,1,7
The majority of people with mental illness do not engage in violence against others and most violence is caused by factors other than mental illness. It is important to remember these individuals are far more likely to be the victims of violence than the perpetrators.,2019-02-27 23:07:33,Twitter for iPhone,1,8
We must keep guns out of the hands of people who should not have access to them such as domestic abusers and those with violent histories and it is critical we do this without stigmatizing those with mental illness.,2019-02-27 23:07:03,Twitter for iPhone,0,1
This bipartisan bill would require background checks for all gun purchases with some reasonable exceptions and is one of many long overdue steps forward to begin to address this epidemic which claims over 36000 lives every year on average.,2019-02-27 23:06:31,Twitter for iPhone,0,1
