Sending prayers and support to my colleague John Lewis tonight. Hate the news. He’s as tough as he is determined. God bless him and his family.,2019-12-30 03:04:31,Twitter for iPhone,24,108
Great numbers @mattgaetz highlighted. Look at the RCP average impeachment numbers since the Judiciary hearing started. It’s under water. Americans seeing through the farce. https://t.co/o4Z6HtAVcl,2019-12-27 03:47:16,Twitter for iPhone,34,65
Friends wishing you all a Merry Christmas!  Isaiah 9:6 - “For unto us a Child is born unto us a Son is given; And the government will be upon His shoulders. And His name will be called Wonderful Counselor Mighty God Everlasting Father Prince of Peace.”,2019-12-25 22:57:57,Twitter for iPhone,35,178
Chairman Schiff misled about collusion evidence misled about whistleblower contacts fabricated a @realDonaldTrump comment in a hearing and we now know from the IG report that his FISA memo was bunk. I’ll take a hard pass on this letter. https://t.co/W6wIMeN6L6,2019-12-17 22:16:27,Twitter for iPhone,160,537
Still haven’t heard one good explanation from House Democrats trying to impeach @realDonaldTrump: in FIVE U.S.-Ukraine interactions between July and September 2019 how did this supposed political “quid pro quo” fantasy not come up even ONE time?  The reason is: it didn’t happen,2019-12-17 19:55:28,Twitter for iPhone,18,56
Amazing. Great job Mark. God bless you Sgt. Corley! https://t.co/xUcAPfmgQ2,2019-12-17 17:41:19,Twitter for iPhone,9,24
Brand new polls showing bad news for House Democrats impeachment.  USA Today: 41% support 56% oppose - under water by -15. Independents oppose by 11 points  Quinnipiac: 45% support 51% oppose. Independents oppose by 22 points 58-36.  Americans see through this.,2019-12-17 17:15:34,Twitter for iPhone,48,94
Jim is right. I remember this segment and plenty others. Evidence of FISA abuse against President Trump’s campaign was right there if you were willing to read the documents. Many ignored it. https://t.co/O5GtBaJfQ1,2019-12-17 01:39:19,Twitter for iPhone,258,827
About to join @marthamaccallum here in a few minutes talking new polls out today showing rising support for @realDonaldTrump against impeachment. 7:00pm. Hope you’ll tune in.,2019-12-16 23:50:04,Twitter for iPhone,3,23
USA Today poll out today has more. Voters against impeachment 41-56. 15 points. Huge swing. Independents against impeachment by 11 points.   Trouble for House Democrats.,2019-12-16 21:49:44,Twitter for iPhone,22,52
Wow. Quinnipiac poll out today shows impeachment underwater by -6 points 45-51. Independents oppose impeaching @realDonaldTrump by 22 points 58-36! Voters are seeing through the charade.,2019-12-16 21:48:34,Twitter for iPhone,196,817
Chairman Schiff claiming he was unaware RE: evidence of FISA abuse. Malarkey. @DevinNunes memo laid out the evidence in detail. Schiff saw the same info Nunes @Jim_Jordan I and others did. He ignored it and continued to spread false innuendo about @realDonaldTrump anyway.,2019-12-16 16:17:13,Twitter for iPhone,1129,3408
God bless our military men and women - greatest in the world. And bravo @realDonaldTrump for showing support! https://t.co/XK5AnAw6uv,2019-11-29 19:18:34,Twitter for iPhone,30,200
Joining @seanhannity shortly around 9:05pm. We’ll discuss how the impeachment case against @realDonaldTrump yet again collapsed under questioning — and how it was again all based on a false assumption with no evidence.  Tune in.,2019-11-21 01:42:58,Twitter for iPhone,46,259
Excellent work today from my colleagues @Jim_Jordan @RepChrisStewart @RepRatcliffe @RepMikeTurner @EliseStefanik and several others.   The Democrats' impeachment effort against @realDonaldTrump didn't just fail to advance today -- it took several steps back.,2019-11-20 01:37:29,Twitter Web App,68,265
This morning's impeachment hearing: someone who has never met or spoken to @realDonaldTrump *interpreted* his call with Ukraine as a "demand." That interpretation is disputed by multiple others--including the witness sitting right next to him.  This is a farce.,2019-11-19 19:02:10,Twitter Web App,66,136
So much of the Democrats' impeachment effort has revolved around unelected bureaucrats airing their policy grievances with the President.  America elected @realDonaldTrump. Not those bureaucrats.  If they disagree so strongly they should go put their name on a ballot. https://t.co/6Z6KheIODR,2019-11-19 00:06:53,Twitter Web App,14590,46074
Adam Schiff and Democrats are denying GOP witnesses like the whistleblower claiming they want to prevent "sham investigations."  If they want to prevent a "sham investigation" they're far too late. Because a "sham" is what this entire episode has been. @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/3nrkJ9g9xs,2019-11-14 23:16:06,Twitter Web App,305,610
We're seeing a common theme through these witness interviews:   The people who were closest to @realDonaldTrump consistently say there was absolutely NO link between military aid and political investigations.   This was about rooting out corruption and protecting taxpayer money.,2019-11-06 21:13:58,Twitter Web App,65,104
Huge night for North Carolina. Massive win for @realDonaldTrump and conservative values. @DrGregMurphy1 and @jdanbishop CONGRATULATIONS on outstanding races and job well done—now let’s get to work! #NC09 #NC03 #NCpol,2019-09-11 02:36:31,Twitter for iPhone,750,2756

The Democrats want to hold Bill Barr in contempt for following the law careen toward baselessly impeaching @realDonaldTrump and are even calling in a Watergate convicted felon to try and do it. I’m on @IngrahamAngle at 10:15 to discuss. Tune in!,2019-06-05 00:32:32,Twitter for iPhone,22,38
No collusion. No obstruction. @Jim_Jordan and I will be on with @seanhannity at 9:45pm reacting. Tune in.,2019-03-26 01:21:43,Twitter for iPhone,206,2179
As we’ve known all along: it was hardworking Americans who elected @realDonaldTrump—not Russians.  No collusion. No obstruction. It’s over.,2019-03-24 23:43:58,Twitter for iPhone,67,226
If and when the “no collusion” verdict comes down you can expect the left to treat the Mueller result just like they treated the 2016 election result: they won’t accept it,2019-03-23 19:18:11,Twitter for iPhone,157,681

I’d like Andy McCabe to publicly answer for why the Obama intel community circulated (and leaked) an uncorroborated Democrat oppo research project and used it to open an investigation without ANY reliable intelligence to back it up https://t.co/p6XAN2Cy0S,2019-02-21 02:31:27,Twitter for iPhone,52,83
Via @DailyCaller: 3 truths you won’t find in Andy McCabe’s book:  1) McCabe is a known liar and leaker  2) Rod Rosenstein has avoided transparency at every turn  3) Scores of evidence show top FBI and DOJ brass without basis targeted @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/h6gGqAjfmq,2019-02-20 22:24:17,Twitter for iPhone,33,61
You would think McCabe would be able to keep his story straight for at least 48 hours. The lies keep falling apart. https://t.co/sClM4zHs71,2019-02-20 18:23:21,Twitter for iPhone,299,759
I’ll be on with @JudgeJeanine tonight at 9:05 reacting to @POTUS’ @realDonaldTrump’s move to build the wall with legal executive authority and responding to Andy McCabe’s continued stream of untruths and convenient memory lapses,2019-02-17 00:28:18,Twitter for iPhone,265,1632
Two powerful moments from last night’s #SOTU:  1) @POTUS defending the sanctity of life in front of the nation  2) The President’s firm repudiation of socialism. “America will never be a socialist country.”,2019-02-06 20:07:25,Twitter for iPhone,12,27
I’ll be joining @seanhannity tonight reacting to @POTUS’s #SOTU speech shortly after 11. Will be joining @Jim_Jordan and @SteveScalise. Hope you’ll tune in!,2019-02-06 01:41:36,Twitter for iPhone,40,266
The idea of legalizing the killing of born alive babies should be treated exactly as it is: repugnant un-American and morally bankrupt to the core.   Every politician whether they’re in the Senate or elsewhere should stand up and reject this. Period. https://t.co/M3a7WouoJp,2019-02-01 17:59:45,Twitter for iPhone,143,321
