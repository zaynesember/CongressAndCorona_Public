Short-term funding creates uncertainty that harms our Navy shipbuilding industry and overall workforce. The Senate must pass spending bills so we can jointly pass a bill that fully funds the government for Fiscal Year 2020. (2/2),2019-09-19 19:54:25,Twitter Web App,4,10
The House has passed critical spending bills but the Senate has yet to pass a single one. This has left us with the unenviable task of passing stopgap funding legislation that will only fund the government for a few weeks. (1/2) https://t.co/NE8D6wfkWt,2019-09-19 19:54:25,Twitter Web App,3,10

I’m serving in Congress to ensure equality for my daughter and every American woman. Ten years after the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act was signed into law women are still battling the wage gap.

Congress and the President need to come together to reopen government and get people back to work. Then we can hear from the experts debate evidence-based immigration policies and work on smart bipartisan reform. https://t.co/MjQvrhHsoF,2019-01-24 13:20:13,Twitter for iPhone,17,50
We feel this proposal would gain support across the aisle allow a transparent process and encourage much-needed reforms to our immigration system.,2019-01-23 22:52:29,Twitter Web Client,5,31
This Congress didn’t cause the shutdown but it’s our job to fix it. I’m proud to lead an effort to #EndTheShutdown and find common ground.

Another rescue by @USCG as they work without pay during the 32-day shutdown. Due to the shutdown routine patrols are curtailed and the Coast Guard is only responding to search-and-rescue missions. I support a House bill that would pay the Coast Guard now. https://t.co/VRmRx6ZCAq,2019-01-22 21:38:48,Twitter Web Client,21,53
The shutdown is hurting research efforts around Hampton Roads. New proposals can’t be submitted and existing projects are stalled. I have voted 9 times to reopen all or parts of our government.

The Coast Guard is our wall at sea. Readiness is eroding as training &amp; maintenance are deferred during the shutdown. Whether the future mission is counter-narcotics weather response or countering trafficking the Coast Guard’s operations will be riskier because of the shutdown. https://t.co/UcIJWZYRgv,2019-01-20 15:01:16,Twitter for iPhone,38,96
