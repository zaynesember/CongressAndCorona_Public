During my 20 years in the Navy &amp; as a Member of Congress I swore an oath to protect our Constitution from enemies both foreign &amp; domestic. I swore to serve my constituents &amp; the American people. We owe it to the American people to hold the President accountable for his actions.,2019-09-24 02:07:39,Twitter for iPhone,898,3906
I did not run for Congress to impeach the President. I ran for Congress to ensure a brighter future for our children. I ran for Congress to put our country over party. I ran for Congress to serve and defend our country.,2019-09-24 02:07:38,Twitter for iPhone,260,1494
