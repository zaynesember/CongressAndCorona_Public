The #MuellerReport illustrates a presidency founded on opportunism lacking in understanding of history or the functions of government and devoid of respect for public service or the rule of law. #MuellerTestimony #MuellerHearing,2019-07-24 22:21:53,Twitter for iPhone,16,84

Director Mueller confirmed this today: Trump knew about Russia’s sweeping and systematic attacks on our election. Trump knew about Wikileaks’ dumps of emails stolen by Russia and lied to investigators about it.   #MuellerHearing #MuellerHearings #MuellerReport https://t.co/0OjwIG3tFp,2019-07-24 15:59:50,Twitter Media Studio,2605,4830
MGS: Your report also stated that “in addition some witnesses said...that Trump privately sought information about future WikiLeaks releases.”  Is that correct?   Mueller: Correct.  #MuellerHearing #MuellerTestimony #MuellerHearings,2019-07-24 15:35:33,Twitter Web App,269,560

We are witnessing a lawless Administration and a lawless president. Anyone else would be prosecuted if they did what @realDonaldTrump is alleged to have done.   No one is above the law. #MuellerHearings,2019-07-24 13:54:18,Twitter Web App,66,259
The President tried to fire Special Counsel Mueller and directed people to lie to investigators.   That is a cover up. That is called obstruction of justice.   #MuellerHearings https://t.co/WvrkTtZzdX,2019-07-24 13:52:12,Twitter Web App,100,232
