Eugene Hahs’ family contacted my office because they knew he served our country in WWII but they had no records of his service.

The ‘Green New Deal’ would skyrocket energy bills for millions of Americans and lower income families would be the hardest hit. More like a #GreenRawDeal https://t.co/w63lwD2iLc,2019-02-07 23:34:11,Twitter for iPhone,9,18

Fact check - the female unemployment rate has fallen to historic lows under this presidency. As we saw last night Democrats in Congress refuse to celebrate YOUR jobs and can only clap for THEIR jobs. https://t.co/JpqzT63lz8,2019-02-06 14:43:55,TweetDeck,4,13

The State of our Union is STRONG. Unemployment is low wages are growing and Americans are keeping more of what is theirs. But more work lies ahead. We must lower health care costs help American workers and farmers and support our President to solve the crisis at our border. https://t.co/DClqGkwYzk,2019-02-06 05:06:16,Twitter for iPhone,3,13

It’s ridiculous that Democrats are refusing to stand for keeping our country safe and putting cartels out of business #AmericanSecurityOverPolitics #SOTU,2019-02-06 02:50:22,Twitter for iPhone,12,40
The economy is BOOMING under President Trump’s leadership and I’m honored that I was able to write the historic tax cuts that along with regulatory relief helped make it possible. #SOTU https://t.co/0qJNvZAOwn,2019-02-06 02:39:42,Twitter for iPhone,5,7
I couldn’t agree more with the President - repealing the death tax is one of the best things we can do for family farmers. That’s why I’ve authored the bill to end the death tax once and for all. #SOTU,2019-02-06 02:30:53,Twitter for iPhone,10,42

The largest illegal fentanyl shipment in history was just seized trying to cross into the US at our southern border. We are clearly at a crisis point and need to act now to secure our borders and keep our country safe. https://t.co/1TM157AihN,2019-02-01 13:34:48,Twitter for iPhone,3,14
The CBO’s most recent report confirms what every American knows - President Trump’s policies have boosted the economy. From creating jobs to lifting wages the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is working.

Where I come from you don't get a pay raise just for showing up to work. Today Dem leaders pushed a $5B pay raise for federal workers who are paid well above the HOUSEHOLD income in southern Missouri.

Today I shared the story of MaryAnn and Greg from Missouri who have a pre-existing condition and have struggled to find options with Obamacare. We need more competition and optionsnot a complete government takeover that forces people to buy plans they can’t afford. Watch above⤴️,2019-01-30 03:31:05,Twitter Web Client,5,11
The left tries to say that Republicans don't support protecting pre-existing conditions because we disagree with Obamacare and plans for a government takeover of the healthcare system. In reality it can't provide adequate coverage to those who need it. https://t.co/olLwFozA94,2019-01-30 03:29:44,Twitter Web Client,13,25
Be safe this week - some places in Missouri may see a wind chill as low as -40 degrees! When it's this cold frostbite can set in within 10 minutes. Make sure you have everything you need to stay warm and safe during the bitter cold.  https://t.co/kqkjyM5BpL,2019-01-29 16:03:43,TweetDeck,1,7

I'm glad that those currently protecting our airports and borders are finally getting paid but I have no confidence that in 21 days the Democrat leadership will suddenly want to negotiate and we will find ourselves in a better place with plans for a more secure border. 4/5,2019-01-26 00:20:17,Twitter Web Client,3,7
The Speaker claimed she wouldn’t negotiate securing the border until the government was reopened and now she has her shot. 3/5,2019-01-26 00:20:17,Twitter Web Client,1,2
In response Speaker Pelosi refused to allow her Caucus to meet with the President offered no more than $1 to secure our borders and even went as far as canceling the State of the Union. 2/5,2019-01-26 00:20:16,Twitter Web Client,1,2
Over the last 35 days of this partial government shutdown President Trump has been more than reasonable making offer after offer in good faith to Speaker Pelosi and Minority Leader Schumer to reach a long term deal to secure the border and reopen the government. 1/5,2019-01-26 00:20:16,Twitter Web Client,2,8
