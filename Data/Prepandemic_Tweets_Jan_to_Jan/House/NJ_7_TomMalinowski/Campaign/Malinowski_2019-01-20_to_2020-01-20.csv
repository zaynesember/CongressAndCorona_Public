I asked Col. Alex Vindman if any of these examples constituted interference in our elections. He said no calling them totally different from Russia's covert effort in 2016: "a deeper insidious effort to undermine a country's elections to falsify elections."

Why would anyone think it's OK to demand that an ally of the US treat these as crimes?  I mean . . . anyone but pro-Putin Russians? After all they were the ones who first floated these examples of Ukrainian "interference" in 2016. https://t.co/59FPoB1TMB (9),2019-11-09 22:12:41,Twitter Web Client,9,28
So to sum up: when Trump asked Ukraine look into interference in 2016 he was demanding a CRIMINAL investigation into (1) an article defending their official policy on Crimea (2) a dumb Twitter post and (3) the disclosure of info that helped our FBI prosecute a criminal. (8),2019-11-09 22:12:40,Twitter Web Client,7,17
I'm not sure why they think it's bad that a Ukrainian journalist revealed actual evidence of corruption by Manafort that the FBI then used to put him behind bars. Anyway it's certainly not election interference. (6),2019-11-09 22:12:40,Twitter Web Client,27,125
Their third example was that in 2016 a Ukrainian journalist Serhyi Leschenko disclosed evidence that Trump's campaign manager Paul Manafort was getting off-the-book payments from corrupt Ukrainians. (5),2019-11-09 22:12:40,Twitter Web Client,18,79
Their second example was that in 2016 the current Ukrainian Minister of Interior Arsen Avakov called candidate Trump a "clown" on Twitter. Foreign officials shouldn't use that kind of language but to call this "interference" in our election is silly. (4),2019-11-09 22:12:39,Twitter Web Client,16,84
Here's what Trump had said - a total break with bipartisan US policy.

The first was this oped the Ukrainian ambassador to the US wrote in 2016 which the Republicans said showed that Ukraine was against Trump.

I asked her about all the real anti-corruption reforms the administration was pushing for in Ukraine (pp. 246-251). Did any of the people speaking for Pres.

Whether we use force or not the best way to hold Iran accountable is to act in concert with our allies (not just the Saudis).

I oppose proposals that would encourage even more migrants to risk coming like decriminalizing border crossing or giving undocumented migrants health care. But the decent people now fleeing violence &amp; wanting a better life for their kids shouldn't be treated like a threat. (17),2019-08-02 23:48:21,Twitter Web App,7,41
And finally let us secure the border while passing the comprehensive immigration reform that had huge bipartisan support in Congress -- before some of my GOP colleagues grew afraid of the man who took over their Party. (16),2019-08-02 23:48:21,Twitter Web App,7,37
Here's a better answer: - restore aid to Central America that Trump recklessly cut - make asylum a viable option instead of ending it so more migrants go the legal route - work with communities like El Paso to manage the flow in a humane &amp; dignified way as they want to do!

We'll be in the worst of possible worlds: inflicting suffering on innocent people betraying America's decades-old commitment to help people fleeing persecution without even denting the humanitarian crisis at the border. (14),2019-08-02 23:48:19,Twitter Web App,7,28
Setting aside the immorality of using cruelty and chaos to deter migration it is not working. People are still coming. If taking children from their parents didn't deter migration proposals to make asylum even harder won't work either. (13),2019-08-02 23:48:19,Twitter Web App,7,28
Meanwhile we've placed barricades at lawful crossings that impede trade and hurt our economy. Most of the vehicle lanes at the busiest commercial crossing in El Paso are marked "cerrado" closed. (12) https://t.co/nAKrTziRkI,2019-08-02 23:48:16,Twitter Web App,8,26

Trump's main immigration adviser Stephen Miller has said that the policy is to present migrants with "multiple unsolvable dilemmas" so that they never try for asylum. https://t.co/M7qqpBb47k (9),2019-08-02 23:47:43,Twitter Web App,17,34
This sounds crazy until you consider the one constant in all of the administration's border policies: to make the process of lawful asylum as painful as possible so that migrants are deterred from coming. (8),2019-08-02 23:47:43,Twitter Web App,11,29
DHS officers admitted that the policy of pushing back lawful asylum seekers is incentivizing unlawful crossing &amp; human smuggling. Ironically families caught crossing unlawfully have a better chance of being released to  families in the U.S. than those who play by the rules! (7),2019-08-02 23:47:42,Twitter Web App,13,35
We tell migrants who ask for asylum to do it lawfully at a recognized border crossing. But when they do 100% are pushed back to danger. So unsurprisingly more and more are crossing between border posts in desperation. This week two died in the attempt. (6),2019-08-02 23:47:42,Twitter Web App,20,45
This new policy forces everyone who asks for asylum at a lawful border crossing to go straight back to Mexico where they wait for months for a hearing easy prey for extortionist gangs. So we've just pushed the misery across the border and tried to wash our hands of it. (5),2019-08-02 23:47:42,Twitter Web App,9,34

Good news - the House just passed my amendment beefing up the Department of Justice response to white supremacist terrorism. After the attacks in Pittsburgh Christchurch and Poway we must take this threat more seriously.,2019-06-20 16:56:56,Twitter Web Client,67,414
Instead he told a blatant and utterly unnecessary lie: that the children fighting for Saudi Arabia in Yemen have nothing to do with Saudi Arabia. This is another blow to the credibility of the State Department at a time when it desperately needs it given the crisis with Iran.,2019-06-19 14:21:01,Twitter Web Client,39,99
So Pompeo could easily have done the honest thing and listed Saudi Arabia as having child soldiers and then decided not to punish it. I would have disagreed with that decision but it would have been lawful.,2019-06-19 14:19:37,Twitter Web Client,22,73
In step 2 of the process the State Department decides whether a country is making a sincere effort to stop using child soldiers and until then what consequences (like sanctions) should be applied.,2019-06-19 14:19:37,Twitter Web Client,8,45
The idea that Sudanese warlords are fighting for the Saudis in Yemen out of the goodness of their heart and on their own dime is absolutely preposterous. These are mercenaries for the Saudi government and the Saudis are 100% responsible for what they do.,2019-06-19 14:19:37,Twitter Web Client,11,53
As the New York Times and others have reported the Saudis use Sudanese militias that recruit children to fight for them in Yemen. Those troops are trained in Saudi Arabia paid in Saudi currency and directed by Saudi generals.  https://t.co/xKlLMHzSb1,2019-06-19 14:19:37,Twitter Web Client,17,50
This is all Pompeo had to do: acknowledge the fact that Saudi Arabia is using at least one child soldier in the war in Yemen. And this fact is impossible to deny.,2019-06-19 14:19:36,Twitter Web Client,12,49
The Child Soldiers Prevention Act sets up a two step process for identifying and holding accountable governments that use children as soldiers.  The first step is a simple factual determination: the State Department must issue a list of countries that do this.,2019-06-19 14:12:12,Twitter Web Client,20,54

We should consider how to define more clearly that actions by presidents to influence or shut down investigations in which they have a personal interest -- as Trump repeatedly and blatantly tried to do - are illegal and prosecutable. (9),2019-04-25 13:10:23,Twitter Web Client,63,334
Finally Mueller concluded that "Congress has authority to prohibit a President's corrupt use of his authority in order to protect the integrity of the administration of justice." I read that not just as an invitation to hold Trump accountable but to legislate. (8),2019-04-25 13:10:22,Twitter Web Client,89,377
Third political candidates should have an affirmative legal duty to report to law enforcement any offer of help coming from a foreign government or that might be illegal like offers of hacked emails.

Second it's illegal for political candidates to share things like polling data and campaign strategy with independent political action groups (IEs) in the US.

The report tells us Trump wasn't working for Russia (thankfully) but also that he wasn't and isn't working for America.

I will cosponsor this resolution. If the House passes it under the National Emergencies Act the Senate will have 15 days to vote up or down. This isn’t about building or stopping the wall; it’s about defending the Constitution. https://t.co/Q6hvx5T6CI,2019-02-14 23:04:58,Twitter for iPad,268,979

I’m proud to cosponsor Rep. Pascrell’s bill to restore the full SALT deduction. Last year’s tax bill deliberately hurt middle class New Jersey taxpayers. Our fight to reverse its worst provisions has just begun. https://t.co/u6zcuNLlMI,2019-02-11 23:01:56,Twitter for iPad,43,207
As an immigrant myself I’ll say there’s also nothing wrong with Americans of Polish Greek Jewish Cuban Arab or other descent urging our gov’t to be interested in their homelands. It keeps America engaged in the world; it’s an antidote to isolationism. https://t.co/DgIuDurPNg,2019-02-11 20:37:27,Twitter for iPad,15,75
There is nothing wrong with debating the substance of our Middle East policy. But to suggest that Jewish money is what determines that policy is anti-Semitism. There can be no place for that on the left or the right.,2019-02-11 20:28:32,Twitter for iPad,51,387

The president rightly applauded Matthew Charles released from prison under bipartisan criminal justice reform. But as an ex-felon in Tennessee Matthew will never be able to vote. I hope the president will back our effort in H.R. 1 to fix that.,2019-02-06 03:56:29,Twitter for iPad,28,189

As a diplomat I often urged foreign dictatorships not to use emergency powers. If Trump does it to spend funds not approved by Congress it would be another tear in our constitutional fabric.
