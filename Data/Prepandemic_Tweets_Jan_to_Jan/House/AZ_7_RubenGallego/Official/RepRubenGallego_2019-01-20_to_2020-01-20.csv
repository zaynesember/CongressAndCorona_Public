TL/DR: Going to war with Iran is illegal. Going to war with Iran for Saudi Arabia is incredibly stupid. We need to strengthen ourselves for competition with China and outlasting Russia. This is in the American interest. A Trumpy war with Iran isn’t. (7/7),2019-09-16 19:48:54,Twitter Web Client,4,15

Trump wants to take money meant to pay service members &amp; vets who dedicate their lives to this country to build his monument to hate.

The Trump admin is eager to sell our public lands to the highest bidder – meeting w/ a uranium company *before* they even started their monuments review.
