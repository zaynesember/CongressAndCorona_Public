“I think this no corporate PAC thing really came out of the 2018 energy and I think it’s partly a result of so many first-time candidates so many of us who were told ‘You can’t win these seats’” said Rep.

@laurieherdman @amteve @LucasPattan @RepKatiePorter @danpfeiffer @CFPBDirector @CFPB This is question of knowing US Consumer Protection law not of the math per se.

@laurieherdman @amteve @LucasPattan @RepKatiePorter @danpfeiffer @CFPBDirector @CFPB Truth in Lending Act requires the origination fee to be added to the interest charge and then that Finance Charge is annualized.

@amteve @LucasPattan @RepKatiePorter @danpfeiffer @CFPBDirector The $20 origination fee is included in the definition of Finance Charge so the interest of $20 plus the fee of $20 makes $40 cost to borrow $200 for 14 days. Answer . . . 520%! Truth in Lending Law requires APR to include fees which  @cfpb  director did not know.🙁,2019-03-11 13:48:05,Twitter Web App,324,1612

@bwradley @kjxoxo @AOC 1/2 Great job on correct mathematical formula but a key aspect of APR as used in the Truth in Lemding Act requires adding certain fees (like origination fees) to the interest cost to determine the Finance Charge and it is designed to help consumers compare costs of borrowing.,2019-03-09 01:01:24,Twitter Web App,0,2
