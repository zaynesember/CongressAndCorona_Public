Now regardless of the Supreme Court’s decision in June Trump still doesn’t have an alternative plan to ensure Americans don’t lose healthcare coverage. This is the reason they were never able to repeal the law in the first place. (5/6),2019-12-19 14:35:51,Twitter for iPhone,427,1624
This process is meant to undermine the Affordable Care Act which has expanded coverage to millions of Americans despite its imperfections. After the Trump Administration failed to repeal and replace the law they had to find another legal alternative to destroy it. (4/6),2019-12-19 14:35:51,Twitter for iPhone,375,1331
At this time the 5th Circuit Court decided that the individual mandate is unconstitutional. This may be appealed and there may be a Supreme Court decision in the future but for now the lower courts will continue discussing the rest of the law. (3/6),2019-12-19 14:35:51,Twitter for iPhone,276,1137
First let’s be clear about one thing the most important thing. The Affordable Care Act with all its successes and flaws is still the law of the land. You should still enroll in healthcare coverage. (2/6),2019-12-19 14:35:50,Twitter for iPhone,443,1662

That's also why I spoke against an amendment that would gut this important legislation allowing federal officials to negotiate better drug prices for the American people.

That’s why I introduced legislation to bring taxpayer dollars back to the people which passed the House today as part of H.R. 3.

Claims that drug price negotiation will devastate research are nothing but fearmongering—we've got to stop repeating Big Pharma’s talking points. Based on data from a survey of PhRMA’s own member companies 1 in 3 dollars spent on drug research comes from American taxpayers.,2019-12-12 23:07:37,Twitter Web App,22,121
I promised Orange County families I would work to lower drug prices. That requires a strong plan that involves negotiating fair prices for the American people. Today the House passed H.R. 3 the Lower Drug Costs Now Act which would do just that.,2019-12-12 23:07:36,Twitter Web App,211,1520

We can &amp; must do more.,2019-09-25 17:23:28,Twitter for iPhone,81,574
Welcomed @netflix's #Unbelievable team to discuss the need to clear the rape kit backlog an effort I'm proud to lead the fight to increase funding for.

Capitalism doesn’t work if people can’t make informed decisions about where to put their money.

These predatory agreements favor corporate interests and hurt families in #CA45. I was proud to vote for the #FAIRAct today which would put an end to forced arbitration clauses.

Forced arbitration agreements take away the right to seek justice in our courts from consumers who get cheated and workers who are harassed.

A lot of people are asking me to detail what I saw. I’m so glad people are staying engaged in this issue so took some time to summarize my thoughts in a new thread here: https://t.co/rOpOUrpqF3,2019-08-30 16:20:56,Twitter for iPhone,54,171
Finally I learned that I have more to learn. I’ll continue to engage these organizations try to see more facilities ask more questions and push for better solutions. Everyone I encountered at the border deserves nothing less than Congress’ full attention on this. (18/18),2019-08-30 16:14:36,Twitter for iPhone,196,2176
Longer ICE detention and fuller facilities increase the profits of these corporations but may hurt the public. That makes good oversight all the more important. (17/ ),2019-08-30 16:14:36,Twitter for iPhone,172,1179
Fifth the Otay Mesa Detention Center is run by a for-profit contractor. As a Congressmember I have a duty to make sure tax dollars are being spent appropriately. Detention should be used to increase public safety not line the pockets of corporations. (16/ ),2019-08-30 16:14:36,Twitter for iPhone,270,1453
One detainee I spoke to was a single mom working a good job as an office manager in OC for 10 years. She was paying taxes and caring for her kids. Now that she’s detained she has two kids who are homeless in OC. And taxpayers are paying to surround her with security. (15/ ),2019-08-30 16:14:36,Twitter for iPhone,384,1258
Criteria for parole release are inconsistent across ICE detention centers and judges are not regularly involved in this process.  Fourth many ICE detentions seem to run counter to public safety and good sense. (14/ ),2019-08-30 16:14:35,Twitter for iPhone,149,875
Part of the reason for long detentions is that ICE decisions on parole are made by one person at each facility—something that surprised me as this is a hugely impactful decision. (13/ ),2019-08-30 16:14:35,Twitter for iPhone,153,907
Third ICE detention is often very long. Some detainees are in prison for over a year which can cause a backlog of people in Border Patrol custody—and those facilities are not designed to house people for more than a day or two at most. (12/ ),2019-08-30 16:14:35,Twitter for iPhone,117,793
As an aside Border Patrol agents find it challenging to keep kids in custody. They have compassion: one agent took time away from his family on Christmas to dress up as Santa for the kids at that facility. I met a 2-year old and 4-year old with their mom in a cell. (11/ ),2019-08-30 16:14:34,Twitter for iPhone,95,903
Kids in CBP get screened with 24 hours by agents with EMT training but these agents are burning out working long shifts with constant medical work. EMT training is not aimed at detecting illness or assessing chronic conditions; it is trauma training. (10/ ),2019-08-30 16:14:34,Twitter for iPhone,121,973
Second Border Patrol needs medical personnel and additional medical training. Adults in CBP custody aren’t getting screened by medical professionals at all and when they get sick sometimes entire facilities have to be shut down and decontaminated. (9/ ),2019-08-30 16:14:34,Twitter for iPhone,152,1003
First better technology will help secure the border. When I asked a border patrol agent if improved technology would help him do his job he gave a clear yes. And he offered examples and illustrations from his two decades of work. (8/ ),2019-08-30 16:14:34,Twitter for iPhone,126,956
Below are 6 takeaways I had on how Congress can and should act on to improve the situation at the border: (7/ ),2019-08-30 16:14:33,Twitter for iPhone,99,682
The openness and respect from the people on the ground particularly the career Border Patrol agents seems inconsistent with the apparent move by DHS leadership to deny congressional staff access to facilities. (6/ ) https://t.co/fSdJmmnOe2,2019-08-30 16:14:33,Twitter for iPhone,149,876
I’m a big believer in accountability and ICE employees and CBP officers seemed to support the oversight I was conducting. They spoke candidly with me asked what else I would like to see and allowed me to speak directly with detainees. (5/ ),2019-08-30 16:14:33,Twitter for iPhone,96,917
I personally spoke with immigration advocates social workers medical professionals law enforcement officials and detainees including families and children. I am taking what I saw and learned firsthand to my constituents in CA and my colleagues in DC  (4/ ),2019-08-30 16:14:33,Twitter for iPhone,86,789
What is happening in CA is different than in TX or AZ. These differences reflect geography history culture resources and other factors. My first observation to share: the “southern border” is not a monolithic static  thing and our leaders need to see that. (3/ ),2019-08-30 16:14:32,Twitter for iPhone,115,930
I visited 3 facilities: the non-profit San Diego Rapid Response Network Migrant Shelter the Otay Mesa ICE Detention Center and the Chula Vista Border Patrol (CBP) Station. They interact with immigrants at different stages and were very different from each other.  (2/ ),2019-08-30 16:14:32,Twitter for iPhone,109,738
Many of you asked for more detail about my trip to the border this week so I wanted to take time to share my thoughts. (long but important thread),2019-08-30 16:14:31,Twitter for iPhone,1993,5486

So again I ask: when will the Senate vote on common-sense bipartisan legislation to prevent gun violence? And will the President throw his support behind #HR8 and #HR1112 before more lives are lost?,2019-08-03 22:36:42,Twitter for iPhone,760,3129
Gun violence is so common in the United States that 3 survivors of the #Gilroy shooting also survived the 2017 shooting in Las Vegas. https://t.co/YcXpgtqwjd,2019-08-03 22:36:42,Twitter for iPhone,832,2030

The #Equifax class action settlement demonstrates why we need stronger laws to protect consumers. You may have heard that you can claim $125. However the fund for those claims is limited and won’t be divvied up until January. The amount you receive could be much lower than $125.,2019-07-27 02:21:26,Twitter for iPhone,1502,4969

Working parents shouldn’t be stopped from running for Congress bc they can’t afford childcare while they run.
