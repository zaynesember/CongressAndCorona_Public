1) This is so dramatic.  2) They STILL don’t grasp that the House process is not the trial- the Senate has the trial &amp; Trump will absolutely be able to face his accusers (House managers/prosecutors in this case).  3) Who is @RepLoudermilk? Never heard of him (&amp; I worked w/ him). https://t.co/7vzxFpHC1K,2019-12-18 19:38:42,Twitter for iPhone,148,1093

So this feels like a bit of justice - Trump will go down in history as 1 of only 3 American presidents to be impeached. And it only happened because we flipped the House. 2020 is here — time to fight to hold the House flip the Senate and White House and restore our democracy.,2019-12-18 17:05:33,Twitter for iPhone,160,1136
It’s solemn but it’s time. Trump abused his power obstructed justice risked our national security and so much more that he admitted via tweet and TV.

No @RepStefanik. Those are not the most important facts. The most important fact is that Ukraine received the aid  BECAUSE the whistleblower stepped up.

OMG. If you had any doubt as to how hard it is for the Republicans to legitimately cast doubt on any of this please turn on the hearings now and see if you can make sense of anything they are trying to make Taylor say. I sure can’t. #impeachmenthearings,2019-11-13 18:00:14,Twitter for iPhone,994,7495

Taylor closing: “Russian aggression cannot stand.” Three decades of bipartisan unity around this position in Congress and across administrations. Trump’s actions are horrifying. It might be even worse that Republicans in Congress are going along with it.,2019-11-13 16:37:47,Twitter for iPhone,101,521
Our aid to Ukraine is literally about our OWN national security as well as theirs. This is why people who have dedicated their lives to our country (like the witnesses today) have stood up to say that a president withholding that aid for his own benefit is the ultimate betrayal.,2019-11-13 16:20:16,Twitter for iPhone,76,396
Taylor is reminding us that Russia is an adversary. Having sat on Armed Services for nearly a year I can confirm: our military knows Russia is our most dangerous immediate threat. Trump like forgot? Didn’t listen? Doesn’t care? Has financial interests? Yeah. It’s a problem.,2019-11-13 16:15:41,Twitter for iPhone,313,1745
PS I am saying “he” because I listened to The Daily podcast with @mikiebarb today and they said the whistleblower is known to be a man. 🤷‍♀️ Today’s episode “A third graders guide to the impeachment hearings” is a must listen for learning... and also adorable.,2019-11-13 16:00:56,Twitter for iPhone,21,247
IMPORTANT: The quid pro quo term has confused things. “This for that” is normal in diplomacy- aid in exchange for access to a base economic cooperation etc. The difference is that Trump was not asking for something to help America but to straight up help HIMSELF get re-elected.,2019-11-13 15:55:06,Twitter for iPhone,177,991
The GOP tactic is apparently to disrupt as much as they can and obsess over the whistleblower. His identity DOES NOT MATTER. The complaint literally told us the people we needed to talk to that were directly involved. They want to out a CIA agent for pure politics.,2019-11-13 15:41:18,Twitter for iPhone,436,2335

Wonder why @senatemajldr let four gun violence bills sit on his desk for 6 months?  Seems 1.6 million in NRA $$ is more important than the thousands killed/injured from gun violence this year.

Last night on @FOXLA with @Elex_Michaelson he asked how we can stop the cycle of gun violence.   Let me be clear: we must be loud and not stop until @Senatemajldr McConnell takes action.

We hope you mean it this time @senatemajldr. The House passed gun violence legislation months ago — it has been on your desk since. You can start there.

I’m angry. Angry that people are dying everyday from gun violence yet for some NRA $$ is still more important.

If we want to change systemic sexism and we have the power to we have to call it out. And we need to change what leadership looks like by making space for women at every decision-making table.

It’s #EqualPayDay representing how far into the year women must work to earn what men earned the previous year. And it’s worse for women of color. #CA25 women &amp; families are impacted by the #paygap daily — that’s why I’m fighting to change it with the #PaycheckFairnessAct. https://t.co/QVdF8o5ZJe,2019-04-02 21:16:43,Twitter for iPhone,25,58
Last night @AOC helped raise 3 candidates in tough districts more than 30k each in a few hours. Corporate PACs can give candidates 5K - &amp; it comes with strings.

It’s my responsibility as a congresswoman to share my own experiences especially the ones hardest to talk about.

A budget is a statement of values &amp; the #TrumpBudget is clear: trillions in cuts to Medicare/Medicaid to pay for tax cuts to billionaires.
