Mitch you don't need another month to write new legislation. You need to get back to Washington and take a vote. Well actually you need to get back to Washington and take FOUR votes. #WheresMitch,2019-08-08 23:07:27,Twitter Web App,137,615
4. The funding bills we supported in the House that would allow the Center of Disease Control and the National Institutes of Health to study firearm injury and mortality prevention which will be key to writing data-informed laws that keep our kids safe.,2019-08-08 23:07:26,Twitter Web App,83,390
3. The #ViolenceAgainstWomenAct closes the "boyfriend loophole" which would stop partners convicted of abuse or stalking from being able to buy a gun. This is especially needed since we know domestic abuse is one of the biggest predictors of mass shootings. Again. No-brainer.,2019-08-08 23:07:26,Twitter Web App,88,355
2. #HR1112 would close the Charleston loophole which enabled Dylann Roof the murderer of nine innocent churchgoers in Charleston to get his hands on a handgun he would have otherwise been denied due to a delay in his background check processing. This happens too often.,2019-08-08 23:07:26,Twitter Web App,76,304
1. #HR8 The Bipartisan Background Checks Bill would expand background checks on gun sales — including those at gun shows over the internet or from private dealers –– that currently don't require a background check. Total no-brainer and supported by over 90% of Americans.,2019-08-08 23:07:25,Twitter Web App,101,344
Mitch McConnell said today that he can't call the Senate back in session yet because staff needs time to draft gun violence prevention bills.

Proud to sign. I'll be even prouder when @senatemajldr gets back to Washington to do his job and call a vote.  160+ days of inaction. 160+ days of obstruction.  160+ days of failing to show up for the American people.   #EnoughIsEnough https://t.co/beoouJgVsW,2019-08-08 15:52:27,Twitter Web App,111,643

The actions of these Washington Republicans do not reflect the values of the Republicans I know love and respect in CA-25. That's what hits me the hardest.

It’s absolutely absurd to cut funding from real emergencies — like cleanup and future forest fire mitigation after the most deadly fire season in California’s history — to sidestep congressional approval.,2019-02-15 16:14:55,Twitter Web Client,70,355
The ability to declare a #NationalEmergency is given to the President to act when Congress doesn't have time to. Not when Congress acts and the President disagrees. This is why the American people don't have faith in their government — the political games have to stop.,2019-02-15 16:14:54,Twitter Web Client,224,991
This government spending bill is a path forward that will increase border security and keep our government open.
