With each passing day that President Trump fails to grant TPS to Venezuelans the  hypocrisy becomes clearer. Enough talk - denying TPS to Venezuelans is cruel and inhumane. It is past time to act.,2019-07-16 17:42:37,Twitter for Android,10,13
La doble moral del presidente Trump queda en evidencia cada día que pasa y no otorga el TPS a los venezolanos en EE.UU. Basta de hablar es momento de actuar. Negar el TPS a los venezolanos es cruel e inhumano. El momento es ahora. https://t.co/ZsxtgYgFdS,2019-07-16 17:30:38,Twitter for Android,8,20

The trust and support of the Latino community in South Florida must be earned Mr. Trump. You have a long way to go. 3/3,2019-06-25 15:40:29,Twitter for Android,7,27
How can you say you stand with our communities when you refuse to grant or extend TPS for Venezuelans Nicaraguans or Hondurans?  How can Latinos support you while your administration continues to house children in cages? 2/3,2019-06-25 15:39:51,Twitter for Android,20,43

The President has no business in South Florida if he does not plan to extend TPS for Venezuelans. In 2018 nearly 22000 Venezuelans filed for asylum in the United States. Maduro has oppressed his people and cut off basic needs to live. #VenezuelaLibre,2019-02-18 15:10:22,Twitter for iPhone,25,102
