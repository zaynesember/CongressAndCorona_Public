H.R. 19 was offered as an amendment to H.R. 3 and even got some bipartisan support but unfortunately not enough to pass.   I encourage Speaker Pelosi to work more on this issue in a #bipartisan way to get into law changes that will help lower the cost of prescription drugs.,2019-12-12 19:58:58,Twitter Web App,1,2
This legislation will:   ✔️Help lower out-of-pocket costs ✔️Protect access to new medicines and cures ✔️Encourage competition between manufacturers  With H.R. 19 we have an opportunity to seriously address this issue &amp; help Americans who are struggling with their medical costs. https://t.co/1Q72PjbDgp,2019-12-12 19:58:58,Twitter Web App,11,32
I believe that the loss of even 1 new cure is 1 too many which is why I voted no on H.R. 3 today. There are things #Congress can do to address reducing the cost of prescription drugs.

We all agree action needs to be taken to lower the cost of prescription drugs. However H.R. 3 is not the right solution to this issue.
