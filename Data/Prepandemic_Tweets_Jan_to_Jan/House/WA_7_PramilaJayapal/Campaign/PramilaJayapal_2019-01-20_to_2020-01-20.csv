Thx @BernieSanders for talking abt enormous amounts of $$ we spend on wars. We need to cut $2 trillion from our military budget over 10 years &amp; we need to respect our troops by NOT sending them to war unless absolutely necessary.

@HouseDemocrats @BernieSanders @ewarren Like the House &amp; Senate #Medicare4All bills @ewarren’s plan makes this coverage immediately available to all Americans to buy into for a nominal fee that goes to $0 by the end of the transition period—which would mean even more Americans w/comprehensive #MedicareForAll coverage.,2019-11-15 20:36:19,Twitter Web App,54,288

One last attempt at clarification: when Warren says she asked for assessment over 10 years she is talking abt COST estimate of MFA over 10 years. That is CBO time frame for costs.

@ewarren Clarifying something important since some are pushing incorrect info. @Ewarren endorses @BernieSanders plan &amp; has now put out financing plan on how she would pay for it. She assumes same 4-yr transition as Sanders different from my #MedicareForAll bill which has 2-yr transition.,2019-11-01 16:03:49,Twitter Web App,171,655
@ewarren Now the only question left is why ANY Democratic candidate for President would NOT endorse #MedicareForALL? Why protect a broken for-profit system that doesn't reduce healthcare costs doesn't cover everyone &amp; doesn't address the crisis that is literally killing Americans?,2019-11-01 14:23:20,Twitter Web App,107,513
@ewarren Why? As I've said since I introduced my 2019 #MedicareForAll House bill America's healthcare expenditures today are enormous &amp; increasing. #MedicareForAll cuts out #BigPharma &amp; for-profit insurance companies' huge admin waste putting patients over profits for the first time.,2019-11-01 14:21:33,Twitter Web App,35,274
.@ewarren puts all the #MedicareForAll naysayers to shame by outlining a financing plan that shows we CAN &amp; MUST provide quality guaranteed healthcare to everyone while reducing costs. Her financing plan shows we can spend less &amp; cover everyone w/guaranteed comprehensive care. https://t.co/2QkqLCLIxb,2019-11-01 14:17:25,Twitter Web App,465,1819

@WestLADemClub @DebDingell To address our crisis a health care plan:  1) Must guarantee quality health care to EVERYONE 2) Take on the out-of-control costs and administrative waste of the current system  #MedicareForAll is the only plan that actually does both of these things.,2019-10-27 18:33:51,Twitter Web App,14,36
@WestLADemClub @DebDingell Today despite poor health outcomes we have the most expensive health care system in the world. Why can other major countries guarantee universal healthcare but we can’t?

Why are we talking about raising taxes instead of providing jobs raising wages or addressing worst #IncomeInequality since 1920s?

Also since I wasn't live-tweeting last night have to lift up @BernieSanders &amp; @ewarren for absolutely leading the pack last night on bold ideas in spite of unfair leading questions &amp; attacks from other candidates just trying to increase their percentages.,2019-08-01 01:55:59,Twitter Web App,330,3033
Just appreciating @sunrisemvmt @VarshPrakash @NationalNurses @AdyBarkan &amp; the incredible movements that do the work to ensure that #ClimateChange and #MedicareForAll are key parts of these debates. #GrassrootsOrganizing works.,2019-08-01 01:54:42,Twitter Web App,116,516
Why do the debate moderators keep framing things to have one candidate attack the other? How about just asking people to give their best ideas and see what emerges?,2019-08-01 01:52:24,Twitter Web App,1122,8451
I agree completely with @ewarren: "We're not going to solve the urgent problems we face with small ideas and spinelessness. We're going to solve them by being the Dem Party of big structural change the party that fights for our democracy &amp; our economy to work for everyone.",2019-08-01 01:50:42,Twitter Web App,286,1553
For @TulsiGabbard &amp; so many Pacific Islanders protecting the environment is not just political it's personal.  That's why we need a #GreenNewDeal. That's why we need #ClimateJustice.,2019-08-01 01:47:16,Twitter Web App,16,79
"#ClimateChange is not a single issue. It is all the issues we Democrats care about." My gov @JayInslee is right about the far-reaching intersectional impacts of the #ClimateCrisis. We need bold action NOW.,2019-08-01 01:42:14,Twitter Web App,35,118
Gotta respect the candidates who have spent their lives fighting on a particular issue: @JayInslee on climate @BernieSanders on #MedicareForAll &amp; income inequality @ewarren on taking on Wall Street &amp; corporate profiteers. Each has more to them but they are so strong on these.,2019-08-01 01:39:08,Twitter Web App,42,299
Powerful from @SenGillibrand: "It is their whiteness that stops them from being shot.",2019-08-01 01:37:10,Twitter Web App,115,531
Thank you @BilldeBlasio. Enough fear-mongering. We need #MedicareForAll so that EVERY American can have quality affordable care.,2019-08-01 01:27:02,Twitter for Android,4,26
Thank you @JulianCastro for talking about police accountability &amp; use of force standards. Thank you @JayInslee &amp; WA voters for putting into place in our state real de-escalation plans &amp; requiring proof for use of deadly force.,2019-08-01 01:22:29,Twitter Web App,26,158
"There are people in jail for life" because of phony "tough-on-crime" policies. Agree @CoryBooker.,2019-08-01 01:17:35,Twitter Web App,12,84
Thank you @CoryBooker! "Everyone has worth and dignity." We can't allow @realDonaldTrump and Republicans to divide some immigrants against others.  You don't need a PhD to be worthy of coming to this country.,2019-08-01 01:15:09,Twitter Web App,7,60
.@JulianCastro is 100% right. We must learn the lessons of the past. Immigration is a winning issue for us but we've got to have the guts to take on @realdonaldtrump and his cruelty.,2019-08-01 01:09:24,Twitter for Android,193,1159

.@michaelbennet the Republican talking point that people love their private insurance simply isn't true—79% of Democrats and 56% of Independents want to keep their doctors NOT their for-profit plan https://t.co/u8L3Y8JEMY,2019-08-01 00:51:24,Twitter for Android,25,66
.@joebiden 63% of Americans can't afford to cover a $500 emergency- yet your plans allows up to $1000 copay limits? https://t.co/tMQc93KVW1,2019-08-01 00:41:53,Twitter for Android,2517,9169
The #MedicareForAll movement is powerful because grassroots members have fought for years to achieve true universal healthcare and remove the profit-motive from the system.   Any policy that uses the #M4ALL name MUST embody these principles NOT undermine them.,2019-07-30 22:26:33,Twitter Web App,136,552
#MedicareForAll means:  ☑️ Guaranteed comprehensive benefits for EVERYONE ☑️ No private insurance premiums co-pays deductibles or out-of-network doctors ☑️ For-profit industry does NOT have a role in determining one’s right to healthcare  Anything less is NOT Medicare for All.,2019-07-30 22:26:33,Twitter Web App,446,1321
I appreciate the robust healthcare debate my Democratic colleagues have brought to the table. But as lead sponsor of #MedicareForAll I find it misleading when my fellow Democrats use the #M4A name to describe proposals that are NOT #MedicareForAll https://t.co/v5epwXoWD2,2019-07-30 22:26:07,Twitter Web App,1930,7413
That’s the country I want to live in and that’s the country that we’re going to fight for!   Thank you @CCIAction #ThePeoplesVoice now let's get to work!,2019-07-27 20:00:57,Twitter Web App,2,25
We want a country that:  ☑️ invests in a #GreenNewDeal  ☑️ gets money out of our politics ☑️ strengthens workers ☑️ expands Social Security &amp; Medicare ☑️ invests in our children ☑️ advances equality protects choice &amp; dismantles racism ☑️ allows people to THRIVE not just SURVIVE,2019-07-27 20:00:56,Twitter Web App,9,41
But your work does not end there. Our responsibility to take our country back means asking questions speaking up and demanding change long after the dust has settled from the caucus.   Winning back the White House is not our only goal.  #ThePeoplesVoice,2019-07-27 20:00:56,Twitter Web App,1,5
We have an incredible opportunity to articulate a clear progressive vision for our future that honors who we are as a country and what we stand for. Iowans will cast the first votes and I hope you will embrace a candidate who has a bold vision of the future.   #ThePeoplesVoice,2019-07-27 20:00:55,Twitter Web App,1,9
We can take our country back. It won’t be easy.  But we must be ready and we must organize!  We must fight for everyone and leave no-one behind.    We cannot only be an opposition party we have to be a proposition party.  #ThePeoplesVoice,2019-07-27 20:00:55,Twitter Web App,1,7
And speaking of taking back our country... that's why we announced yesterday we have filed a petition in Court that makes very clear that we are in the midst of an impeachment investigation.   No one is above the law. We will hold this president accountable.  #ThePeoplesVoice,2019-07-27 19:53:54,Twitter Web App,7,19
Is this a bold ambitious plan? Yes. It has to be. But bold solutions are required to take back our country. #ThePeoplesVoice,2019-07-27 19:53:54,Twitter Web App,3,13
Here's what #MedicareForAll does:  ✅ we cover everyone ✅ no co-pays premiums or deductibles &amp; you can go to any doctor or hospital you want  ✅ comprehensive coverage ✅ we bring down Rx drug costs ✅ we cover long-term care for individuals w/ disabilities &amp; older Americans,2019-07-27 19:53:53,Twitter Web App,9,11
The fact that the opposition is pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into trying to defeat #MedicareForAll is proof that we are being successful.,2019-07-27 19:53:53,Twitter Web App,1,6
Even as people are dying because they can’t afford their treatments the top pharmaceutical companies are raking in $75 billion in profits a year. #MedicareForAll,2019-07-27 19:53:52,Twitter Web App,4,6
Today in America we have the highest maternal mortality rates -- that’s moms dying in childbirth -- and highest infant mortality rates -- that’s babies dying young -- of our peer countries. We have the lowest life expectancy of our peer countries.  #MedicareForAll,2019-07-27 19:53:52,Twitter Web App,2,5
Every day Americans are forced to decide between paying for their insulin or their rent. They feel it when they have to file for bankruptcy because they get a surprise bill to pay for a cancer treatment that wasn’t covered.   #MedicareForAll,2019-07-27 19:53:52,Twitter Web App,2,6
And I am fighting for #MedicareForAll a comprehensive proposal of a healthcare system based on patients not profits where everyone is in and no-one is out recognizing the fundamental truth that health care IS a human right not a privilege available only to the wealthiest few.,2019-07-27 19:42:50,Twitter Web App,4,23
Out of the 11000+ people who have ever served in Congress I’m one of only 79 women of color. And I am one of only 14 naturalized citizens in Congress showing @realDonaldTrump EXACTLY what patriotism looks like.  #ThePeoplesVoice,2019-07-27 19:42:50,Twitter Web App,5,33
I never thought I'd serve in office. But then I realized this: we organizers were ceding important political space by not running for office ourselves.  Our policies are better our democracy stronger if the people making policy decisions look like America  #ThePeoplesVoice,2019-07-27 19:36:48,Twitter Web App,4,26
But here’s the thing: we organizers know that strength comes in times of crisis and that is why our work and presence are more important than ever.   While I am now a proud Member of Congress I am and will always be an organizer.  #ThePeoplesVoice,2019-07-27 19:36:48,Twitter Web App,2,16
There is so much darkness around us—I know our hearts ache so much because of the hate the violence the vitriol the refusal to talk about the reality of institutionalized racism sexism transphobia homophobia in a way that allows for real change.   #ThePeoplesVoice,2019-07-27 19:33:30,Twitter Web App,1,11
Our movement puts organizers activists regular working people in office people who will not just vote the right way when pushed but will LEAD our conversations on tough issues. Leaders who won’t just wait for something to BE popular but will help make it so   #ThePeoplesVoice,2019-07-27 19:33:30,Twitter Web App,2,12
If we are going to reverse this the ONLY way is with a transformative grassroots movement that takes on a system that is completely rigged for the largest corporations and the wealthiest and has stopped responding to regular people   #ThePeoplesVoice,2019-07-27 19:33:29,Twitter Web App,2,9
Economic insecurity that has been building for decades led to a hole - and Trump and his racist xenophobic policies swept right in &amp; filled it with white supremacists racists and corrupt swampers who promise one thing but do the exact opposite   #ThePeoplesVoice,2019-07-27 19:33:29,Twitter Web App,1,9

ICYMI: Trump's $4.75 trillion budget calls for massive cuts to education and environmental protections &amp; a $1 TRILLION cut to Medicare &amp; Medicaid. But the rich keep their tax cuts.

Budgets are a moral document that reveal your true values. Trump's budget cuts Medicare by $845 BILLION to keep tax cuts for wealthy individuals and corporations. Is this what America stands for? I say no. https://t.co/lAeSwot3op,2019-03-11 19:15:00,TweetDeck,9,32

Why does the Medicare system pay 80% more for prescriptions than the VA? Why does the UnitedHealth CEO make over $80M/yr?

I spoke with @DemocracyNow about the truth of our for-profit health care system.
