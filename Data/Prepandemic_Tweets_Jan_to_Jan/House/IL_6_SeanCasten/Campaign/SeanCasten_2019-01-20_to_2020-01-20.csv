@GOP @GOPLeader 32/ But until they do those who would defend our democracy and this beautiful 243-year old experiment should not rest easy.  Removing Trump through impeachment or the ballot box will not be enough. /fin,2019-11-23 20:13:34,Twitter Web App,596,3212
@GOP @GOPLeader 31/ And so the voters must.  And I know they can.  Because Elijah Cummings is right.  We're better than this.

@GOP @GOPLeader 21/ That's not a trick question. But the answer is easy: we should do our job.  Do oversight.  Demand accountability.  Use every tool in our arsenal up to and including impeachment if necessary.,2019-11-23 19:59:39,Twitter Web App,555,3633
@GOP @GOPLeader 20/ Not the Democrats not the Republicans.  What should CONGRESS do?  As the co-equal branch with oversight authority.  As 535 members who have taken an oath to defend the Constitution against all enemies foreign AND domestic?,2019-11-23 19:58:00,Twitter Web App,707,3889

@GOP @GOPLeader 17/ Trump is useful to them.  He does not understand government does not respect our institutions and is instinctively hostile to multi-lateral long-term win-win agreements.  His mere presence in the White House is a threat to the post-WWII order.,2019-11-23 19:55:08,Twitter Web App,1034,4708

@GOP @GOPLeader 15/ But there are also non-financial reasons that may not even require Trump's intent.  Remember that Russia is no longer a great power.  Their economy is the size of Texas.  Life expectancy is collapsing.  They are totally dependent on oil &amp; gas.,2019-11-23 19:52:49,Twitter Web App,606,3390

@GOP 6/ That is textbook corruption.  It is also a textbook bribe.  It is also a quid pro quo. These are all synonyms no matter what the President says.,2019-11-23 19:42:34,Twitter Web App,818,5029
@GOP 5/ The "favor" was to look into Crowdstrike (a Russian-sponsored fully-debunked conspiracy theory) and to dig up dirt on the Bidens.,2019-11-23 19:41:51,Twitter Web App,629,3984
@GOP 4/ Donald Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine until they "did a favor" for him.  Those are his words in the version of the call transcript that he released. https://t.co/Nf9wqnxZ7w,2019-11-23 19:40:55,Twitter Web App,791,4341

22) With heavy hearts we move forward.  No member of Congress celebrates this moment.  But yesterday I'm glad to at least report that the majority of us voted not to shirk our responsibility. /fin,2019-11-01 19:03:52,Twitter Web App,8,72
21) But we - and by we I mean all of us - cannot allow their obedience to conclude that a partisan vote is bad policy.,2019-11-01 19:03:01,Twitter Web App,5,42
20) I am sorry - and in many ways angry - that not a single Republican saw fit to vote in favor of these rules.  Their obedience and deference to the Executive branch is an abdication of their responsibilities.,2019-11-01 19:01:48,Twitter Web App,10,58
19) So what happens next?  We wrap up closed sessions as soon as we can and then move into open hearings subject to these rules.  We do so with open minds and no pre-determined verdict.,2019-11-01 19:00:23,Twitter Web App,4,31
18) Indeed if we DID require a full vote of the House to approve the agenda of any committee the House would never get anything done.  Every member of Congress knows that.  But some are hoping the public doesn’t.  That is irresponsible.,2019-11-01 18:59:07,Twitter Web App,11,42
17) In the same fashion it makes no sense to argue that the Intel Oversight Judiciary Ways &amp; Means Financial Services or Foreign Affairs committees cannot hold hearings subject to their jurisdiction prior to a full vote of the House.,2019-11-01 18:57:43,Twitter Web App,5,34
16) For example no one would argue that the Science Committee cannot hold hearings on ocean acidification prior to a full vote of the House.,2019-11-01 18:57:02,Twitter Web App,6,34
15) Others have suggested that the prior process required a vote of the house.  That argument is silly and unfounded.  Every committee in Congress has the right to set their own agenda subject to the majoritarian opinion of their members.,2019-11-01 18:56:33,Twitter Web App,6,38
14) In the Clinton and Nixon cases impeachment hearings came AFTER the AG's office had led closed hearings to ensure that witnesses could not coordinate their stories.  Barr’s failure to do so and his efforts to distort the Mueller report forced a different process this time.,2019-11-01 18:55:22,Twitter Web App,7,54
13) However the approach taken was fully appropriate given the circumstances.,2019-11-01 18:54:45,Twitter Web App,3,31
12) Some have suggested that the prior phase should have been open.  That's irrelevant to what we do next.  History is behind us.,2019-11-01 18:53:59,Twitter Web App,4,33
11) That's the extent of the logical objections.  That's not to say that there can't be illogical objections of course... so let's examine some of those.,2019-11-01 18:52:55,Twitter Web App,4,33
10) (c) Because you think the Congress should not inquire as to whether the President should be impeached under any circumstances,2019-11-01 18:50:41,Twitter Web App,7,43
9) (b) Because you are opposed to majoritarian democracies where the actions of a legislative body require the consent of &gt;50% of the members or,2019-11-01 18:50:12,Twitter Web App,6,41
8)  (a) Because you want greater protections to the President in this process than has ever been granted in prior processes,2019-11-01 18:49:17,Twitter Web App,5,44
7) So it's worth asking the question why someone would vote "no" on yesterday's resolution.  There are only three logically possible reasons:,2019-11-01 18:48:40,Twitter Web App,5,41
6) This weird narrative that the minority party deserves greater protection implicitly presumes that the minority party is on trial. No one is making that argument except perhaps for those who doth protest too much.,2019-11-01 18:47:08,Twitter Web App,9,69
5) There is a very important point to be noted in that prior table.  The protections afforded by this process are to the President not his political party.  As is appropriate since he is the subject of our inquiry.,2019-11-01 18:44:49,Twitter Web App,5,54
4) The rules we passed were not only fair but in some cases more generous to the President than the rules that were passed for the Nixon and Clinton processes. https://t.co/yHnRVdz03j,2019-11-01 18:42:21,Twitter Web App,17,74
3) The question we were all asked yesterday was not whether we should move forward but whether we agree to move forward subject to a specific set of rules.,2019-11-01 18:41:07,Twitter Web App,7,50
2) On the substance let’s first state the obvious: we did not vote to impeach the President yesterday nor did we vote to initiate an impeachment inquiry nor did we vote on articles of impeachment.  We voted to set the rules for the next (open) phase of the process.,2019-11-01 18:40:08,Twitter Web App,14,60

And how formative.,2019-10-14 16:04:25,Twitter Web App,2,11
@SethS_D 17/ And yet the diversity of those K-12 schools was - and still is - driven in part by the fact that so many affluent families opted out the better to help get their kids into colleges and towns like mine.,2019-10-14 16:00:02,Twitter Web App,1,8
@SethS_D 16/ It certainly has for me.  My college grad school and current hometown were terrific and created opportunities for me I would never trade in... but none were as diverse as the K-12 public schools I started in.,2019-10-14 15:54:19,Twitter Web App,1,13
@SethS_D 15/ And that's fine!  We want the best opportunities for our kids.  We want to live &amp; work in places where we are valued and respected.  But that process tends to filter out diversity.,2019-10-14 15:52:36,Twitter Web App,1,13

The House would grind to a halt if it were required to vote on what we're going to vote on.   Trump's request that we do so is inane. He's not asking for protocol. He's asking because he doesn't understand nor respect the power of a co-equal branch.  #TruthExposed,2019-10-09 16:38:51,Twitter Web App,21,132
