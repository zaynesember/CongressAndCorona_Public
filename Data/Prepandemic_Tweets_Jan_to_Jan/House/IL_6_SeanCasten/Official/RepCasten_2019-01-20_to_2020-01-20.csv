Here in the district today I appreciated the opportunity to join @UCPSeguin volunteers with intellectual and developmental disabilities and those without to help children and adults -- including homeless veterans here in our community -- who face food insecurity.,2020-01-18 22:31:27,Twitter for iPhone,2,16
One of my deepest held beliefs is that we should help our neighbors in their time of need. #MLKDayofService https://t.co/RT2PZRdWyn,2020-01-18 22:31:26,Twitter for iPhone,14,83
This week @FSCDems heard from the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) an independent board that issues guidance on accounting standards. I questioned them on the proper role of independent boards &amp; Congressional authority. Watch my full exchange here: https://t.co/CDwkLsZ3JL,2020-01-17 21:36:09,Twitter Media Studio,6,20
I’m excited to hear that @Microsoft is taking these bold steps to combat the #ClimateCrisis by going carbon negative by 2030. This is a positive step for #ClimateActionNow. More organizations should take meaningful action to reduce carbon emissions. https://t.co/zRjmHO1fUC,2020-01-17 20:06:14,Twitter Web App,9,35
The answer is clear if we are going to successfully combat the #ClimateCrisis and reduce carbon emissions we need to dedicate the resources to increase our grid’s storage capabilities.,2020-01-16 20:08:06,Twitter Web App,3,18
Our bill would allocate $1.05 Billion to improve coordination of DOE’s storage efforts create a grant program to help public &amp; private entities expand their energy storage capabilities and fund pilot programs to bring wide-scale deployment of storage technologies.,2020-01-16 20:08:06,Twitter Web App,2,12
@HouseScience @ENERGY Dr. Fall’s answer underscored the importance of increasing our grid’s storage capabilities so that we can deploy more clean tech into our energy mix a policy I've long advocated for. That’s why I introduced the Promoting Grid Storage Act w/ @SenTinaSmith. https://t.co/DOzUIWvLI3,2020-01-16 20:08:06,Twitter Web App,2,7
Yesterday @HouseScience held a hearing with @ENERGY’s Office of Science Director Dr. Chris Fall. During the hearing I asked Dr. Fall about how we can deploy existing #CleanEnergy technology to our electric grid. https://t.co/cYbRBx0Khi,2020-01-16 20:05:00,Twitter Media Studio,6,21
The @usedgov exists to protect students not those institutions defrauding students. That’s why I was proud to vote for H.J. Res 76 this morning to protect defrauded students and get them the relief they desperately need.,2020-01-16 18:36:49,Twitter Web App,7,18
.@BetsyDeVosED has refused to help college students with debt relief after they were defrauded by predatory for-profit colleges like when Argosy University closed in the Chicago area. https://t.co/qnHc0W4VlF,2020-01-16 18:36:48,Twitter Web App,23,44
The fact that only 5 states have acted to stop these practices is reprehensible. Every child should feel safe at school. I hope that @BetsyDeVosED will do the right thing &amp; act quickly to ban these practices nationwide. Read the full letter below: https://t.co/m0mUHl829o,2020-01-15 21:04:58,Twitter Web App,7,25
That’s why I led a letter along with @SenatorDurbin @SenDuckworth my Illinois House colleagues and @RepPressley to @BetsyDeVosED demanding she issue guidance to end this abuse that is endangering our children. https://t.co/CAJ84tdmw0,2020-01-15 21:04:57,Twitter Web App,4,25
When @ChicagoTribune released their story on the horrific use of child seclusion &amp; life-threatening restraints in schools which are disproportionately used against children with disabilities I knew these practices needed to end immediately. https://t.co/kVofUfdCE9,2020-01-15 21:04:57,Twitter Web App,22,79
I’m so glad that I got to show the students and teachers of @WheatonAcademy the unique history of the US Capitol this morning during our tour. My office is always open to #IL06 residents when they are in town. https://t.co/7iJ1ihavgt,2020-01-15 17:21:59,Twitter Web App,5,53
The Climate Risk Disclosure Act would require public corporations to disclose information relating to the financial &amp; business risks associated with #ClimateChange so we can transition our financial sector away from these unsustainable and risky investments.,2020-01-14 16:45:54,Twitter Web App,3,7
While I’m pleased that #BlackRock is taking the first step to adjust to the inevitable reality of #ClimateChange we need to see similar action across the financial sector. That’s why we must pass my bill with @SenWarren H.R. 3623 the Climate Risk Disclosure Act.,2020-01-14 16:45:54,Twitter Web App,11,21
Investors and the public deserve to be informed on how companies are planning to address the risks that the #ClimateCrisis poses to our financial sector so they can make sound financial and investment decisions for the future.,2020-01-14 16:45:54,Twitter Web App,2,9
Putting #ClimateChange at the center of investment strategy is critical to adequately addressing the #ClimateCrisis. https://t.co/04CzCBdUqD,2020-01-14 16:45:53,Twitter Web App,8,24
Last night I was proud to vote to allow @DeptVetAffairs to connect eligible #Veterans with dental care services in their communities. I will always fight for the most accessible highest quality health care for our patriotic Veterans.,2020-01-14 15:31:07,Twitter Web App,4,20
Our #Veterans have sacrificed so much to keep our country safe and they deserve the best health care our country can provide.,2020-01-14 15:31:07,Twitter Web App,2,22
On April 22 1970 millions turned out to the streets to call for greater protections for our planet 🌏 100 days from now millions will rise to demand climate action. #EarthDay2020 https://t.co/LBsN8LBo1k,2020-01-13 20:56:24,Twitter Web App,11,36
All this week I’ve been sharing some of the accomplishments that I have achieved during my first year in office.   Everyday I am humbled to represent the great people of #IL06 and I will continue to fight for policies that represent our values in 2020. #SeanByTheNumbers https://t.co/XQGWvI8t9e,2020-01-12 23:00:20,Twitter for iPhone,12,93
✅ 1st Town Hall of 2020  Thank you to all the #IL06 residents that came out to hear about this critical time in our nation’s history.

Whether it’s attending a roundtable to discuss prescription drug prices meeting #IL06 business owners or visiting local charities it is always great to get out &amp; learn about all the amazing people &amp; work being done in our community. In 2019 I attended 237 community events. https://t.co/ldxLu54VxF,2020-01-11 17:45:59,Twitter Web App,9,33
It was so great to stand with @USRepKCastor @RepBonamici and climate activists to fight for #ClimateActionNow. I’m so happy to see the urgency surrounding such an important issue! https://t.co/PcL3WwljEt,2020-01-10 21:34:46,Twitter Web App,10,48
Tomorrow I’ll be hosting my first town hall of 2020 and my 23rd town hall overall at Wheaton VFW Post 2164 at 2:00 PM CT. Doors open at 1:30 – hope to see you there! For more information click here: https://t.co/u7aFgMVpSu,2020-01-10 18:57:26,Twitter Web App,2,5
One of my favorite parts of this job is going out into the #IL06 community and hearing from you all. That’s why I made it a point to hold Town Halls in every corner of the district as often as I could which allowed me to hold 22 Town Halls in 2019. https://t.co/6i3neUNqFF,2020-01-10 18:57:26,Twitter Web App,7,17
In Congress I will always fight to hold the @EPA responsible for fulfilling their essential mission of providing clean air clean water and safe drinking water for all Americans and ensure they have the resources needed to carry out this role.,2020-01-10 18:25:49,Twitter Web App,5,20
Today I was proud to vote for H.R. 535 the #PFAS Action Act which would require the @EPA to finally address this environmental toxin that affects the environment &amp; drinking water of Americans across this country by cleaning up contamination sites. https://t.co/7eoDFIDEJ3,2020-01-10 18:25:48,Twitter Web App,18,52
The American people deserve a complete strategy from this Administration and Congress has a constitutional obligation to ensure this Administration cannot enter a catastrophic conflict with Iran.,2020-01-09 23:48:17,Twitter Web App,5,30
Unilaterally invoking war is no way to govern and risks the safety of all Americans. That’s why I voted for the War Powers Resolution to limit the President’s military actions regarding Iran.,2020-01-09 23:48:17,Twitter Web App,4,29
Ensuring Congress’ constitutional check on the President’s war-making power is a safeguard to ensure that we’re not sending our armed forces into needless conflicts &amp; Americans’ confidence that these important decisions are made in Congress not in dark rooms at Mar-a-Lago.,2020-01-09 23:48:17,Twitter Web App,2,8
President Trump’s decision to launch the strike without consulting Congress was reckless and yesterday’s classified briefing failed to provide a substantial strategy.,2020-01-09 23:48:17,Twitter Web App,8,15
United States civilians both home and abroad and our brave servicemembers need to have confidence that their government particularly the Executive Branch has a clear comprehensive strategy. https://t.co/yBaRZpEvZ4,2020-01-09 23:48:16,Twitter Web App,15,53
Everyday constituents across #IL06 write email or call me with their questions &amp; concerns regarding legislation that Congress is considering and the issues that are important to them. I’m proud to say that in 2019 my office has responded to 43281 pieces of correspondence. https://t.co/iBcEA5OXjJ,2020-01-09 17:03:43,Twitter Web App,9,31
Please join me for my Town Hall this Saturday starting at 2 PM to discuss recent events and updates on my legislation.

One of my top priorities is doing everything I can to serve the people of #IL06. My staff has been working hard all year to help #IL06 residents cut through federal red tape and get them the benefits they deserve. In 2019 we closed 381 cases &amp; are currently helping many more. https://t.co/4HUrrAcIQ6,2020-01-08 21:03:46,Twitter Web App,2,19
If we’re going to take meaningful action on #ClimateChange we must invest in more #CleanEnergy infrastructure now. Make no mistake these changes to #NEPA show the President and his @EPA are looking out for the fossil fuel industry not the American people.,2020-01-08 19:08:10,Twitter Web App,4,9
It is utterly irresponsible to completely disregard the #ClimateCrisis when building infrastructure projects that could be in place for the next 50 years or more.,2020-01-08 19:08:10,Twitter Web App,3,8
The Trump Administration’s latest attack in their #WarOnScience is their proposed change to the #NEPA rule which would allow federal agencies to completely disregard #ClimateChange when measuring the impact of new infrastructure projects. https://t.co/9kxtWMWMeH,2020-01-08 19:08:10,Twitter Web App,15,13
2020 is going to be an incredibly busy year in Congress. To keep up with my legislative accomplishments in-district events and everything else that I’m doing follow my social media platforms. https://t.co/OYHPAFckBq,2020-01-08 17:39:04,Twitter Web App,6,15
Over the next week I’ll be sharing some of my accomplishments during my first year in Congress. In 2019 I introduced or cosponsored 313 bills which either help #IL06 families with problems that affect their daily lives or better prepare us to combat the problems of tomorrow. https://t.co/7Sp4TPEeEf,2020-01-07 18:47:44,Canva,9,55
My heart goes out to all those affected by the #AustralianWildFires.,2020-01-06 21:05:06,Twitter Web App,2,10
This is exactly why we must aggressively pursue #ClimateActionNow and transition to clean zero-carbon energy sources.,2020-01-06 21:05:06,Twitter Web App,3,15
These wildfires are a symptom of our current course of inaction which if allowed to continue will only result in more frequent and more extreme climate-related disasters.,2020-01-06 21:05:06,Twitter Web App,3,6
The images of the destruction caused by the wildfires in Australia are tragic and harrowing reminders of the effects of the #ClimateCrisis. People and animals are dying homes are being lost and ecosystems are being irreparably damaged. https://t.co/V9sn5r61b3,2020-01-06 21:05:05,Twitter Web App,7,32
This alarming escalation has already brought a promise of retaliatory action from Iran. It is imperative that administration officials immediately brief Congress on the situation and their plan to protect American citizens and interests abroad.,2020-01-03 18:18:16,Twitter Web App,2,18
On top of this President Trump has spent his entire Presidency thinning our diplomats at the State Department undermining military leaders and denigrating intelligence agencies.,2020-01-03 18:18:16,Twitter Web App,2,14
Strong national security requires an Administration ready to act with a comprehensive plan but President Trump’s decision to launch a strike against Soleimani was conducted without Congressional approval and without an Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF).,2020-01-03 18:18:16,Twitter Web App,1,7
Protecting Americans at home and abroad is of the utmost importance. Soleimani was an enemy to America but reckless action w/o a meaningful plan to navigate this dangerous &amp; complicated threat will only lead to increased targeting of Americans abroad. https://t.co/qvJRfXF9Uq,2020-01-03 18:18:15,Twitter Web App,9,75
It is unacceptable that medicines that Americans rely on can inexplicably increase overnight for seemingly no reason. This is exactly why the Senate needs to pass #HR3 #LowerDrugCosts Now Act to bring relief to families &amp; seniors across the country.,2020-01-02 20:43:06,Twitter Web App,4,33
Whether you have cancer arthritis or multiple sclerosis you will likely see your prescription drug costs jump this year. So far 85 pharmaceutical companies have spiked prices on over 300 drugs and more are sure to come. https://t.co/45IGhihIzg,2020-01-02 20:43:06,Twitter Web App,13,39
My thoughts are with the Lake Zurich community and with our Jewish communities across the country - hate has no home here.,2019-12-30 20:18:15,Twitter for iPhone,4,38
Earlier this week Monsey New York endured anti-Semitic attacks of hate. Today on the last day of Hanukkah Seth Paine Elementary School in Lake Zurich was vandalized with symbols of anti-Semitism. We must condemn all acts of hate. https://t.co/Vywez3yh1y,2019-12-30 20:18:15,Twitter for iPhone,16,56

That’s why I have fought all year for this moment to undo the #GOPTaxScam and restore the State and Local Tax Deduction for hard working people across this country.,2019-12-19 22:19:52,Twitter Web App,6,22
What Hamilton understood is that certain services- roads schools fire departments libraries- are better and more efficiently provided by local authorities. When we double tax that income we create undue tension between federal and local authorities.,2019-12-19 22:19:52,Twitter Web App,4,12
Alexander Hamilton wrote in Federalist 32 that the U.S. Constitution would give states “an independent and uncontrollable authority to raise their own revenues for the supply of their own wants.”,2019-12-19 22:19:52,Twitter Web App,5,6
This bill lifts the #SALT cap doubles the teacher tax credit &amp; creates a deduction for first responders. From the very first tax we have included a deduction for state &amp; local taxes for the simple reason that we shouldn’t tax people twice on their hard-earned income.,2019-12-19 22:19:51,Twitter Web App,5,9
Today I voted for H.R. 5377 the Restoring Tax Fairness for States &amp; Localities Act to finally undo some of the damage done by the disastrous Republican tax bill to my constituents back in #IL06 as well as working middle class families and teachers across the country. https://t.co/cM6JXqRYQ4,2019-12-19 22:18:24,Twitter Media Studio,28,146
No trade deal is perfect but under the #USMCA the trade rules for America will now be fairer.,2019-12-19 21:47:51,Twitter Web App,3,7
And lastly it strengthens our trade relationship with our closest trading allies and supports 12 million American jobs as well as the 120000 U.S. small and medium-size businesses which sell their goods and services to Canada &amp; Mexico.,2019-12-19 21:47:51,Twitter Web App,3,5
This agreement protects American workers ensures that America can act to lower its prescription drug prices and maintains American agriculture export markets.,2019-12-19 21:47:50,Twitter Web App,3,5
For months my colleagues &amp; I have been fighting to improve key provisions of the Trump-negotiated deal that included weak enforcement and labor standards as well as giveaways to drug companies. But we won and improved the agreement.,2019-12-19 21:47:50,Twitter Web App,3,8
Today I am proud to have voted in favor of implementing the #USMCA. https://t.co/c9CWkQon5l,2019-12-19 21:47:50,Twitter Web App,5,17

We all took an oath to protect the Constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic. We all know what President Trump did was wrong. We all know it's wrong to withhold foreign aid for a political favor.,2019-12-18 22:52:18,Twitter Web App,27,136

Emission reductions from clean energy could play a pivotal role in meeting our #ParisAgreement Goals. The EV tax credit would help decarbonize the transportation sector which is the largest source of GHGs nationally. We need #ClimateActionNow and this is an important first step.,2019-12-16 17:49:13,Twitter Web App,10,21
The #ClimateCrisis is the biggest existential threat to life on Earth. We cannot afford to lose critical #CleanEnergyIncentives while our President and the Senate refuse to take action. That is why I am calling for #CleanEnergyIncentivesNOW as a part of an end of year package.,2019-12-16 17:49:12,Twitter Web App,18,81

If we don’t step up bad actors like China &amp; Russia will fill that vacuum continue to pollute and gain standing globally. That’s why we need to rejoin the #ParisAgreement and pursue #ClimateActionNow.,2019-12-15 00:27:13,Twitter for iPhone,5,27

That’s why I introduced the Stop Climate Censorship Act w/ @RepJoeNeguse &amp; @RepBonamici requiring any political appointee that seeks to remove content regarding #ClimateChange in a scientific study to publicly provide the underlying scientific reason. https://t.co/LqWP07QmOh,2019-12-12 21:27:07,Twitter Web App,8,24
The #ClimateCrisis is the single greatest existential threat to mankind yet this Administration has repeatedly barred government scientists who are simply trying to do their job from talking about or presenting the public with crucial facts about the threat of #ClimateChange.,2019-12-12 21:27:07,Twitter Web App,22,48
Lower prescription drug prices will mean reduced prices for the 611886 people on private health insurance and the 89748 people that rely on Medicare Part D in #IL06. Read my full release on #HR3 here: https://t.co/wEwIE4rTUO,2019-12-12 20:39:36,Twitter Web App,4,12
This bill will give the Secretary of @HHSGov the ability to negotiate the price of the most expensive prescription  drugs to ensure patients and taxpayers get the lowest possible price.,2019-12-12 20:39:36,Twitter Web App,2,11
I was proud to vote with all my Democratic colleagues to pass the bipartisan #HR3 #LowerDrugCosts Now Act. When I ran for Congress I promised to lower health care costs for #IL06 families &amp; I’m proud that today I was able to deliver on that promise. https://t.co/VAICwR2OTz,2019-12-12 20:39:35,Twitter Web App,12,47
It will also cap annual out-of-pocket costs in Medicare Part D and reverse years of unfair price hikes above inflation across thousands of drugs in Medicare.,2019-12-12 17:48:49,Twitter Web App,4,9
The bill would finally provide Americans relief from skyrocketing drug prices by allowing the Secretary of Health and Human Services the tools to negotiate lower prescription drug prices.,2019-12-12 17:48:49,Twitter Web App,4,10
The skyrocketing price of prescription drugs is crushing Americans at the pharmacy counter driving up health insurance premiums and creating unaffordable costs for taxpayers who finance Medicare and Medicaid.,2019-12-12 17:48:49,Twitter Web App,2,6
Yesterday I spoke on the House floor on the importance of #HR3 the Lower Drug Costs Now Act and highlighted my constituent Liz Phalen a retired public servant and AFSCME member who has been impacted by the high prices of prescription drugs.

Not only does the #GOPTaxLaw hurt families in our communities by instating a marriage penalty and capping #SALT deduction at $10000 but it also adds a trillion dollars to the #NationalDebt.

But the fact that Congress would – after weeks of delay – finally stand up to an out-of-control Executive by exercising its Constitutional powers is little cause for celebration. Nevertheless I am glad that this unnecessary shutdown drama has been put aside and we can,2019-02-15 02:29:40,Twitter for iPhone,3,7

If this was because there were no causes for inspections or violations that would be great news. But that simply isn't the case.
