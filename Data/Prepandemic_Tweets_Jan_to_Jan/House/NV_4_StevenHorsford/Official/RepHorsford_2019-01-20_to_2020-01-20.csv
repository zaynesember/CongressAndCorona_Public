Thanks to a new report from @WaysMeansCmte Congress knows just how much prescription drugs are costing Americans: as much as 67 times more than patients in other nations. Check it out: #LowerDrugCosts  https://t.co/ddphuZUwkC,2019-10-12 20:43:00,TweetDeck,54,98
3/ Right now Seniors across the country can pay up to $5100 on their medications—this cap will save our seniors $3100 some of which depend on multiple drugs a day. It’s time to #LowerDrugCosts and put money BACK in the pockets of our seniors.   https://t.co/98npsgegru,2019-10-11 15:46:00,TweetDeck,1,5
@RepKendraHorn 2/ Medicare Part D has helped tens of millions of seniors and individuals with disabilities access life-saving therapies and medications.  But Medicare beneficiaries across the country face high out-of-pocket costs for many medications including insulin even with coverage.,2019-10-11 15:45:00,TweetDeck,8,13
1/ I’m proud to work with @RepKendraHorn to present a standalone bill to cap out-of-pocket drug costs for the 46 million Americans with #Medicare Part D. This bill is the first step in lowering prescription drug costs across the country.  https://t.co/98npsgegru,2019-10-11 15:45:00,TweetDeck,14,24

I’m proud to join @RepRoybalAllard @RepYvetteClarke and @NydiaVelazquez to introduce a new Dream Act that will provide protections for TPS and DACA. No matter what the President says representatives in Congress are working to defend rights of immigrants and their families.,2019-05-25 0:10:00,Twitter Web Client,12,14
The President’s proposal would harm Nevada’s 40300 immigrants who are eligible for protection under the Dream and Promise Act. Protecting TPS holders DACA beneficiaries and reuniting family’s needs to be a major emphasis of our efforts to fix our immigration system.,2019-05-25 0:10:00,Twitter Web Client,7,15

The first Social Security check was issued 79 years ago. And today 500000 Nevadans rely on those checks to make ends meet. I’m proud to co-sponsor the Social Security 2100 Act to keep the program strong through the rest of the century. https://t.co/w8VjeoC2zs,2019-01-31 16:56:00,Twitter Web Client,11,36
Glad you came to visit. It’s not every day your old high school track coach drops by your office!    Grateful for the work you all do to mold Nevada’s young people. https://t.co/Jo4l4m1KmI,2019-01-31 14:56:00,Twitter Web Client,3,14

The shutdown is over. But Nevada’s federal workers are still saddled with the late fees and interest that accrued during their 35 days without a paycheck. Congress has an obligation to ensure they get back every penny they’re owed. https://t.co/4Gbpps3Q8t,2019-01-28 22:41:00,Twitter Web Client,28,38
Enjoyed speaking with @RealAutismDiff 5k participants about the importance of protecting federal funding for autism research and services. https://t.co/g01YEP7qug,2019-01-28 21:45:00,Twitter Web Client,2,3

.@lvlcc Education Forum with @csncoyote President Federico Zaragoza and @ccsd Superintendent @SuptJaraCCSD was super informative. So much to do to improve educational opportunities for all of our communities and these leaders have plans to move us forward. https://t.co/VBp2gGsIl8,2019-01-28 3:49:00,Twitter for iPhone,1,13
#TeamHorsford was honored to join Col. Julian Cheater at Creech Air Force Base to celebrate the extraordinary accomplishments of the 432d Wing. We are proud and grateful to these brave men and women. https://t.co/9kQTQdd142,2019-01-27 22:50:00,Twitter Web Client,2,5
On Holocaust Remembrance Day we remember the six million Jews murdered by Nazism and recommit ourselves to eliminating the horrors of anti-semitism bigotry and hatred.,2019-01-27 19:55:00,Twitter for iPhone,4,12
Grateful to the interfaith group that came together at Masjid Ibrahim Friday night. We had a great discussion on the role faith plays in advancing our society. https://t.co/s3ml2MaOKS,2019-01-27 14:39:00,Twitter Web Client,3,10
I met with Nevada-based IRS employees on Saturday to discuss how we could help them recover from the shutdown. Late fees and interest piled up on the 3520 Nevadans denied a paycheck during the shutdown. I'm pushing Congress to make them whole. https://t.co/wwG8aTjR3S,2019-01-26 22:44:00,Twitter Web Client,5,16
And I’ll work like hell to get them every penny they’re entitled to. https://t.co/nN5yyDEAkM,2019-01-26 1:26:00,Twitter for iPhone,3,21
This shutdown has already inflicted so much harm on working people. Now it’s about to wreak havoc on travel which impacts everything from tourism to business to personal travel.  This is unacceptable and must end.   https://t.co/drpwelld4W,2019-01-25 16:08:00,Twitter Web Client,2,7
Tell that to the 3520 NV federal workers who won’t get a check tomorrow because of this stupid shutdown. I’m appalled at the lack of compassion by Trump and Ross who claim people can just take a loan or that grocery stores will just issue credit. What fantasy are they living in? https://t.co/gXlKIRdB3N,2019-01-25 1:25:00,Twitter Web Client,10,15
Not all heroes wear capes.    #TeamHorsford is at today’s @LasVegasFD graduation. Grateful for all the @LVFirefighters do to protect our city. Special shout out to @DSanfordnv on his graduation from the Fire Academy. https://t.co/VDVPVS40VB,2019-01-24 23:20:00,Twitter Web Client,7,26
I’ve voted 11 times to #EndTheShutdown and stop it from hurting Nevadans that rely on housing and nutritional assistance. It’s time for Mitch McConnell to reopen the government and stop hurting Nevada families. https://t.co/lUlxV4y97K,2019-01-24 22:38:00,Twitter Web Client,0,2
Shame on @SecretaryRoss. The Administration should be focused on reopening the government not second-guessing Nevada’s 3520 federal workers being forced to work without a paycheck.   https://t.co/g3Ag9y6YnC,2019-01-24 17:50:00,Twitter Web Client,7,13
Mitch McConnell needs to end this shutdown before it inflicts even more pain on working Nevada families.   https://t.co/hpxO4u0tPE,2019-01-23 23:40:00,Twitter Web Client,5,18
I’ve talked with too many McCarran TSA workers struggling because of the shutdown. I’m fighting to reopen the government on their behalf. And I’m proud of their continued resolve.    https://t.co/fbYHJnnDVW,2019-01-23 16:29:00,Twitter Web Client,1,6
This is shameful. Nevada's transgender service members put their lives on the line to protect our country. They deserve our respect and gratitude - not legalized bigotry.   https://t.co/zHouPa1Caf,2019-01-23 0:02:00,Twitter Web Client,7,9
I continue to be inspired by the Nevadans stepping up to help our neighbors impacted by the shutdown. I’ve voted to end this shutdown eight times. And I’ll continue fighting until we restore Nevada families hard-earned paychecks and services.   https://t.co/s2jnZExHBt,2019-01-22 22:53:00,Twitter Web Client,8,12

More than 30000 Southern Nevada residents could face homelessness if this shutdown continues. It’s long past time Mitch McConnell let the Senate vote on the House’s bipartisan legislation to #EndThisShutdown.    https://t.co/37EPUqHmwz,2019-01-22 16:46:00,Twitter Web Client,12,15
