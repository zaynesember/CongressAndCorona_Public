(1) It didn’t criticize POTUS or his policies. Not once.  (2) It outlined the threat Iran poses and our right to self defense (not excluding preemptive strike).  (3) Only Congress has the power to declare war. Article I sec (8).   Trump called Bush a war criminal. And then won. https://t.co/VQhUQNdGgH,2020-01-10 01:39:15,Twitter for iPhone,2252,5888
