As Dems signed the sham articles of impeachment @potus was signing phase 1 of the China deal thats going to reset the world economy in favor of the American worker.   We'll be stronger because of this trade deal. Dems through impeachment are trying to make our country weaker. https://t.co/I8htzOpRy9,2020-01-17 19:24:55,Twitter Media Studio,1790,6566
As impeachment moves to the Senate and we look at witnesses one witness I still want to see is @repadamschiff.   Even before the motion to dismiss there should be a motion to disqualify Schiff as an impeachment manager because he is a fact witness to the set up.,2020-01-17 16:38:42,Twitter Web App,12074,39636
Lev Parnas’ interview proves that @realdonaldtrump was entirely correct to be skeptical of Ukraine.   Democrats are really scraping the bottom of the barrel if they think that Lev Parnas is their star witness. https://t.co/AaKWlwVYPa,2020-01-17 14:47:11,Twitter Media Studio,3934,12515

44% of the Democratic Caucus was for impeachment before the Ukraine call even took place. Since then we’ve been playing "pin the tail on your favorite impeachment theory."  We've pretty much done nothing but impeachment in the House because Democrats are addicted to impeachment. https://t.co/M6r9lR5Unl,2020-01-15 21:40:20,Twitter Media Studio,2387,7276

Democrats said impeachment was an "emergency" then they sat on the impeachment articles for weeks.   They also told us the FBI did nothing wrong then the Obama-appointed inspector general proved that claim false.  House Democrats are hypocrites before the American people. https://t.co/2mPgJY9jxT,2020-01-13 18:07:31,Twitter Media Studio,2592,9737
We have to do more than just win the impeachment vote in the Senate. We have to win the case with the American people.  The radical Left is unable to win an actual argument with @POTUS about our economy and our standing in the world.

I spoke to @POTUS today and he told me he’s more anti-war than I am.  This resolution did not criticize the president. It said if any president wants to drag our nation into war Congress must approve it.  That’s something I believe and something I think @POTUS deeply believes. https://t.co/pScotpCtO2,2020-01-10 01:56:18,Twitter Media Studio,2557,8524

Remember: @SpeakerPelosi had to use political money as a weapon to threaten a lot of moderate Democrats to vote for impeachment.  Impeachment wasn't a sincere effort to abide by the rule of law. It was a political hit job because Dems have no substantive argument against @POTUS. https://t.co/Rgcbmk6Gbz,2020-01-09 18:20:20,Twitter Media Studio,2807,6500

If the president wanted war with Iran he’s had plenty of opportunities. He’s chosen to exercise restraint and I think we’re seeing the Trump doctrine in action.

The only quid pro quo I observed in this impeachment was on the House Floor.  Dems were told if they didn’t line up behind @SpeakerPelosi and support impeachment they would be bludgeoned by their own party.  Many Dems want impeachment over as fast as possible.

We shouldn’t be tearing down monuments of Founders– we should be adding to them for greater context and richer understanding. @TPUSA https://t.co/eWrIEttH3e,2019-07-31 16:48:45,Twitter Media Studio,4339,11728
.@JoeBiden ripped his environment plan from @AOC. Former Sec. @ErnestMoniz ripped the "Green Real Deal" from me. Obama-era officials seem to be more interested in carbon copying than carbon capture. https://t.co/GDMaSNMR2C,2019-07-31 15:29:11,Twitter Web App,108,403
When Robert Mueller left Capitol Hill “bias” was the word of the day. #NotMyPurview https://t.co/lNILLxKG7r,2019-07-31 14:49:56,Twitter Web App,258,935
"Maybe the reason why there are these discrepancies is that you were biased and wanted to stop @realDonaldTrump."  https://t.co/1IJIJj8pvA,2019-07-30 17:24:38,Twitter Web App,726,2148
President @realDonaldTrump sure is good at winning but one thing we’ve learned is Dems just don’t know how to take the "L." When they lost in 2016 it couldn't be because they had a terrible candidate...it had to be "the Russians told people to vote for Trump!" An absurd idea. https://t.co/gsKLHDmPNw,2019-07-30 14:23:03,Twitter Media Studio,2059,7143

If Robert Mueller wrote the Mueller Report then I wrote Moby Dick. How is it Mueller's purview to write 3500 words about one Russian lawyer's meeting with the Trump campaign when the same lawyer met with DNC operatives the day before and after that meeting?   This was a set-up. https://t.co/1nGTX0upg9,2019-07-29 17:24:35,Twitter Media Studio,6062,14735
Democrats can’t argue with us about economic policies or regulatory policies or energy policies. So instead they try to de-platform and defame and delegitimize anyone that is beating them out there in the public square.  https://t.co/fUV1QXaF5K,2019-07-29 14:39:01,Twitter Web App,2172,5754
My colleague &amp; friend @RepRatcliffe is an excellent choice for Director of National Intelligence. As a former US Attorney he’ll ensure that justice is served fairly &amp; as DNI he will protect America from all threats foreign &amp; domestic. I look forward to his swift confirmation.,2019-07-28 22:02:07,Twitter for iPhone,3188,12902

If the budget is a roadmap for the American people then Speaker Pelosi is driving us into spending oblivion. We cannot allow this. I encourage President Trump to negotiate a deal that strengthens our military helps our veterans and cuts our bloated spending.,2019-07-25 21:28:59,Twitter Web App,875,3036
Earlier today the House passed a budget deal brokered by @SpeakerPelosi. Instead of exhibiting fiscal restraint Speaker Pelosi’s budget is a wish list for Democrat priorities and wasteful spending. https://t.co/uNqcOjISYx,2019-07-25 21:28:59,Twitter Web App,855,2349
Only one of two things are possible. Either Steele made this whole thing up and there were never any Russians telling him of this vast criminal conspiracy that you didn’t find or Russians lied to Steele. @DailyCaller   https://t.co/izw6SOod4n,2019-07-25 20:34:27,Twitter Web App,1700,4132

If there was any bombshell in the #Mueller Hearing yesterday it was a consequence of @DevinNunes's questioning that revealed the investigation did not begin when Robert Mueller said it began.   There were earlier even more corrupt origins. https://t.co/AP07JIgmTB,2019-07-25 19:34:28,Twitter Media Studio,2185,4777
