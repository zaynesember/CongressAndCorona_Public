President Trump diverted money from our military to pay for an ineffective border wall that can be overcome with a $100 electric saw. The President's immigration policies are as out of touch with reality as they are with our nation's values. https://t.co/4CH4dH8jF5,2019-11-02 19:29:11,Twitter for iPhone,5,13

This is the result the Trump Administration wanted when it instituted a "gag rule" putting politics above patients. It is part of their continued assault on women's access to reproductive health care. I am proud to #standwithpp &amp; will fight to remove these #TitleX restrictions. https://t.co/Vy5THUoAfp,2019-08-20 00:41:13,Twitter Web App,2,10
Lake County is a welcoming place with a rich diversity of people communities and businesses. Mr. Curran’s remarks are shameful and ignorant. His prejudice for the people who proudly call Lake County home should disqualify him as a candidate for Senate or any other office. https://t.co/yDxlE3rAxO,2019-08-18 00:59:17,Twitter for iPhone,11,32

Adding a citizenship question is an unconstitutional power grab to give Republicans an unfair electoral advantage for the next decade.
