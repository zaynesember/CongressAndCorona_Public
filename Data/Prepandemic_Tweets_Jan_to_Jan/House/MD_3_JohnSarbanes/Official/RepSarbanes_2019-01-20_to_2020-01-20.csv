Congress cannot allow the President to drag our country into another military conflict without the consent of the American people. Today we took a decisive step to rein in the President’s ability to initiate war with Iran.,2020-01-10 01:50:07,Twitter Web App,0,13
In spite of this the President’s impulse is to heighten brinkmanship with Iran and to do so without appropriate Congressional authorization and in violation of established protocols for consulting Congressional leaders.,2020-01-10 01:50:07,Twitter Web App,0,3

However I am deeply concerned that this provocative action by President Trump will put the lives of even more American service members diplomats foreign service officers and citizens abroad at risk.,2020-01-04 15:25:25,Twitter Web App,2,5

While it’s an improvement on the status quo the agreement we passed today does not serve as a template for future trade agreements.,2019-12-20 12:45:52,Twitter Web App,0,0
It fails to set strong standards to address the climate crisis and expand consumer protections. It could also provide better labor protections for hardworking Americans to ensure that fewer jobs get shipped overseas.,2019-12-20 12:45:52,Twitter Web App,0,0
However despite the many improvements made by House Democrats the new NAFTA agreement falls short in a number of areas.,2019-12-20 12:45:52,Twitter Web App,0,0
The agreement we passed yesterday strengthens oversight and enforcement mechanisms improves labor standards and prevents pharmaceutical companies from abusing the trade pact to lock in high prescription drug prices.,2019-12-20 12:45:51,Twitter Web App,0,1
Importantly the new NAFTA agreement negotiated by House Democrats strips away many of the special-interest provisions pushed by Big Pharma and large corporations – giveaways that were largely embraced by the Trump Administration.,2019-12-20 12:45:51,Twitter Web App,0,2
The new NAFTA agreement I supported yesterday makes several improvements to both the original NAFTA agreement signed in 1994 and the preliminary agreement put forward by the Trump Administration last year. https://t.co/zIo3WaoOjB,2019-12-20 12:45:51,Twitter Web App,1,3
