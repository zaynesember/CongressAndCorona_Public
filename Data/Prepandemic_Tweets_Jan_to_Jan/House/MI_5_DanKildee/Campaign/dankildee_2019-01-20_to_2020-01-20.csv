Thanks to all of our supporters who came out last night in #Flint to support our campaign.  Democrats are fired up and ready to win in 2020! https://t.co/T2MphOxzZd,2019-11-23 20:56:11,TweetDeck,2,12
Great to be with @GaryPeters in Flint! Gary is fighting for Michigan families in the United States Senate. He's willing to work with anyone—Republican Democrat or Independent—to protect our Great Lakes lower health care costs and grow our state's economy. https://t.co/Nv5JVXPQKg,2019-11-23 20:51:42,TweetDeck,2,6
Great to give keynote remarks at the Genesee County Democratic Party dinner! The room was packed full of Democrats ready to organize and win in 2020! https://t.co/URBr1cYSgP,2019-11-18 21:36:37,TweetDeck,3,10
Thank you @IndivisibleMich for having me speak tonight! Your continued focus on the issues that matter most—health care boosting wages protecting Social Security cleaning up corruption— motivates me to keep fighting for you in Congress. https://t.co/fIhPzYmDpp,2019-11-05 01:05:14,TweetDeck,0,5

There's lots of important issues voters care about.   But considering that tonight's #DemDebate is an hour away from my hometown of #Flint every candidate should be asked about their plans to ensure safe &amp; affordable drinking water for all Americans. #DontForgetFlint,2019-07-31 23:59:49,TweetDeck,10,29
Always great to start my morning with the men and women of organized labor who helped to build America’s middle class! #DemDebate https://t.co/6AGTwZ3SzO,2019-07-31 13:17:24,Twitter for iPhone,2,9
What happened to my hometown of #Flint is not an anomaly—it is a warning to the rest of the country. What happened to Flint is the sad but predictable outcome of a failed Republican philosophy of government that puts dollars and cents ahead of people and public health. #DemDebate,2019-07-31 01:39:43,Twitter for iPhone,26,88
Tonight’s debate is an hour from my hometown of #Flint. It’s very disappointing that there hasn’t been a single question yet about ensuring clean water for all Americans. Access to safe and affordable drinking water should be a fundamental human right. #DemDebate,2019-07-31 01:31:54,Twitter for iPhone,16,57
My squad at the #DemDebate—Democrats are fired up in Detroit ready to elect a President that puts working families not the wealthy and well-connected first! https://t.co/Afsw0chcYK,2019-07-31 01:14:46,Twitter for iPhone,158,2184

In 2016 Michigan voted for the President by less than 11000 votes. This time around in 2020 Michigan families have seen and lived @realDonaldTrump’s failed economic promises. They want a new president whomever our Democratic nominee is that will put working families first.,2019-07-30 14:35:43,Twitter for iPhone,4,15
The President also said he would fix our crumbling roads bridges and water systems. Democrats want to work with his Administration on infrastructure but the President has not put forward any serious plan. Another broken economic promise for the families I represent. #DemDebate,2019-07-30 14:32:54,Twitter for iPhone,9,29
.@realDonaldTrump has made promises to Michigan families that he has not kept. Instead of working to make the lives of middle class families better Trump has instead focused on tax cuts for the richest Americans and biggest corporations. 83% of the benefits went to the top 1%.,2019-07-30 14:31:15,Twitter for iPhone,4,7
In 2016 then-candidate Trump came to Michigan &amp; promised voters that “you won’t lose one plant I promise you that.” Today auto plants are closing and thousands of workers are getting pink slips. The President’s economic policies have failed working families. #DemDebate https://t.co/4JGdmnvSRw,2019-07-30 14:28:32,Twitter for iPhone,12,28
My open letter to all Democratic presidential candidates ahead of tonight's #DemDebate in Detroit: https://t.co/cao93KZevR,2019-07-30 11:31:37,TweetDeck,12,28
What happened to my hometown of Flint is not an anomaly. Rather Flint is a warning to the entire country.   As candidates get ready for the Detroit #DemDebate the next President must get serious about tackling the drinking water crisis in our country. https://t.co/OA9BGBN4jh,2019-07-29 18:43:16,TweetDeck,3,3

It’s always a great morning when I get to catch up with our brothers and sisters in labor. Glad I could be in Saginaw to talk about the importance of protecting workers’ pensions and how Congress can support the hardworking families of mid-Michigan. https://t.co/mqLVokPvg1,2019-03-15 15:57:43,Twitter for iPhone,1,2
