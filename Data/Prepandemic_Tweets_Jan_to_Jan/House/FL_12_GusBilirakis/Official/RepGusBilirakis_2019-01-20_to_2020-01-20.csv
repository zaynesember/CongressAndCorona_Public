We've made a great deal of progress in our fight to ensure Vets receive the care they deserve. But anyone with an ounce of knowledge about the situation knows we have a long way to go. To suggest we're trying to privatize the VA and claw back its funding is categorically false. https://t.co/HWVCsruhWB,2019-04-24 15:05:52,Twitter Web Client,4,9

Turkey continues to behave in an unacceptable manner for a NATO member and US ally.
