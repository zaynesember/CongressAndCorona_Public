I’m proud to endorse @electkmreeveswa for WA’s 10th CD - I know that she’ll be a tireless advocate for our middle class families. #TeamReeves2020 https://t.co/lCb8A6nMxh,2020-01-07 19:15:47,Twitter for iPhone,7,17
I plan to vote in support of both articles of #impeachment against President Trump.  Accountability matters &amp; no president should be given a free pass to use the presidency for their personal gain. https://t.co/HXHdj35dLP,2019-12-18 17:16:55,Twitter for iPhone,19,136
Join me in voting to support @WAFairness &amp; approving R-88 to enact I-1000.  It's a commonsense approach to help achieve greater equality for everyone. #Approve1000 https://t.co/lFVSqQQB8N,2019-10-19 16:32:35,Twitter Web App,5,14
I voted to #RaiseTheWage because every American worker deserves a living wage.  This bill would lift millions of families out of poverty and into the middle class.  I'll continue to #FightFor15 until it's enacted into federal law.  https://t.co/f8hiPwcZhQ,2019-07-18 23:14:04,Twitter for iPhone,1,4
I voted to condemn President Trump's racist comments directed at my colleagues yesterday.  His comments are vile and there is no place for these bigoted views in our nation - much less in our government.  https://t.co/S51QBbUvOT,2019-07-17 23:33:40,Twitter Web Client,1,11
#Juneteenth commemorates the end of slavery in the U.S. Lasting effects of slavery continue to be felt today &amp; more must be done to ensure equitable futures for all.

The #DREAMAct was passed in the House yesterday to put millions of young immigrants on a path to U.S. citizenship. It's the first step we must take to fix our immigration system. I'm ready to move this fight forward.  https://t.co/tqEGqMvz98,2019-06-05 19:54:32,Twitter Web Client,1,11

Alabama's ban on abortion is unequivocally cruel and dangerous. Women must always have the right to choose a safe and legal abortion.,2019-05-16 00:01:44,Twitter Web Client,1,4
With the middle class increasingly left behind I've introduced the #PROAct w/ my colleagues.

Trump's new religious exemption rule for health care providers is despicable. Every patient deserves quality care for whatever their health care need is. This rule may lead to discrimination against certain populations &amp; I stand vehemently against it.  https://t.co/1kPPF47iAa,2019-05-05 19:55:43,Twitter Web Client,0,3
I'm working w/ @PramilaJayapal and @CoryBooker in re-introducing the Dignity for Detained Immigrants Act. It'll directly combat AG Barr's decision to indefinitely detain immigrants. This bill is a first step towards fixing our inhumane immigration system.  https://t.co/cH0cs6ZpT7,2019-05-02 18:54:08,Twitter Web Client,5,23
Happy #InternationalWorkersDay! Everyone must have equality of opportunity &amp; my bill H.R. 2370 will ensure that Congress benefits from a unique diversity of ideas and backgrounds to best serve every constituent.  https://t.co/5tdXMRNj1c,2019-05-01 22:09:50,Twitter Web Client,0,4

Now that the Mueller investigation has concluded it’s imperative that Americans can see the full report. Not only did Russia interfere in our election but the Trump campaign was aware of these Russian efforts. The President’s actions are a threat to the fabric of our democracy.,2019-03-26 21:12:04,Twitter for iPhone,1,5

I urge acting Secretary Shanahan to wait until courts have made a final decision before implementing the Pentagon's policy that would limit transgender service members. This is a direct attack on our service members &amp; is one that I will not stand for.  https://t.co/VslsMLlhA3,2019-03-13 20:35:25,Twitter Web Client,0,2
I'm very proud that #HR1 has passed in the House. It's an essential step forward in restoring American democracy.

It's egregious that money is being taken to build a wall that serves no national security interest. As Chair of the House Armed Services Committee I will do everything in my power to prevent the president from continuing this disastrous course of action.  https://t.co/RM1rnjb4CX,2019-02-18 00:36:02,Twitter Web Client,3,9

SCOTUS’ decision to allow the President to enforce his ban on transgender military personnel is incredibly disappointing. Everyone who wants to serve their country must be allowed to do so w/o discrimination. I'll continue to fight against this policy.  https://t.co/LFrXxkHb6e,2019-01-24 22:14:24,Twitter for iPhone,2,5
