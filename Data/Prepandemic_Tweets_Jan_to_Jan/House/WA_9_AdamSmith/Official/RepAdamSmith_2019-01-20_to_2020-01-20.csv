This news complicates the Administration’s argument about the strike's legal authority.

And make no mistake about it I will continue to fight for the provisions we did not get hopefully at some point with a Senate and President who better reflect the values of our country. I know how important these provisions are. 14/14,2019-12-11 20:24:41,Twitter Web App,6,28
I am proud that this bill will better provide for the widows and families of those service members who have made the ultimate sacrifice for our country. And I am proud that this bill reflects Democratic priorities and American values. 13/14,2019-12-11 20:24:41,Twitter Web App,5,16
That is why I so am proud of this bill – because of everything that is contained in its 1249 individual provisions and more than 4000 pages. I am proud that this bill will change the lives of millions by providing paid parental leave. 12/14,2019-12-11 20:24:40,Twitter Web App,1,12
Leader McConnell and Chairman Inhofe would have been thrilled to pass a ‘skinny NDAA’ with zero Democratic priorities. That alternative would have none of the key policies we fought so hard for – no paid parental leave no “widow’s tax” repeal and nothing to address PFAS. 11/14,2019-12-11 20:24:40,Twitter Web App,1,11
President Trump Leader McConnell and Chairman Inhofe would have killed the bill over these provisions. If we kill the bill we would have gotten nothing. Not a single Democratic priority. 10/14,2019-12-11 20:24:40,Twitter Web App,2,13
To those who say that we should have ‘fought harder’ or ‘held the line’ – I can assure you we fought the entire time until the very end. 9/14,2019-12-11 20:24:40,Twitter Web App,2,10
To those who say that this bill isn’t enough – I could not disagree more. When I look at the widows the parents families who will benefit from the bill it is enough. We are delivering more for families across this country than anyone even conceived of going into this year.8/14,2019-12-11 20:24:39,Twitter Web App,2,12
Nonetheless we have accomplished more with this bill than anyone ever thought possible given the realities of a Trump White House and a Republican-controlled Senate and we should be proud of that. 7/14,2019-12-11 20:24:39,Twitter Web App,1,9
Throughout the negotiations I failed in one way: I was unable to turn President Trump Leader McConnell and Chairman Inhofe into Democrats and convince them to suddenly accept all of the provisions they despise. 6/14,2019-12-11 20:24:39,Twitter Web App,1,12
Do you know what they also hated? The repeal of the ‘widow’s tax’ and granting paid parental leave for fed employees. But because of our tireless work we succeeded in getting these provisions and our bill will have real impacts on Americans leading real lives. 5/14,2019-12-11 20:24:39,Twitter Web App,3,14
From the moment we passed our bill through the House without the support of a single Republican vote it was clear that our counterparts in the Senate and White House fundamentally opposed the Democratic priorities included in the bill. 4/14,2019-12-11 20:24:38,Twitter Web App,1,8
To those detractors I ask one simple question: Which of the provisions that did not make it into our final bill did President Trump Leader McConnell and Chairman Inhofe not hate? 3/14,2019-12-11 20:24:38,Twitter Web App,1,8
After months of hard-fought negotiations our bill is now final. It contains major wins for Democrats and working people and promotes our national security. Despite this sweeping success some have decried the bill saying it fails to live up to progressive values. 2/14,2019-12-11 20:24:38,Twitter Web App,1,8
Before my colleagues and I cast our votes on the FY20 NDAA one thing must be made clear: This is the most progressive defense bill we have passed in decades. 1/14,2019-12-11 20:24:38,Twitter Web App,17,44

I continue to believe that spending billions on a border wall with no justification especially in the wake of the GOP tax giveaway to the wealthy is deeply irresponsible especially as we have so many other worthy national priorities.,2019-01-25 21:46:14,Twitter Web Client,5,26
Our policy and legislative process does not work by holding the government hostage and I hope the President has learned that doing so is unproductive and harmful.,2019-01-25 21:46:14,Twitter Web Client,3,6
Finally after 35 days the President has agreed to do what he should have done in the first place: open the government. The impacts of the government shutdown on federal workers and communities across the country have been immense.,2019-01-25 21:46:14,Twitter Web Client,10,38
I voted today to reopen @DHSgov until Feb 28th and have previously voted to do so for the rest of government while negotiations with the Administration continue. It is time to #EndtheShutdown,2019-01-25 01:43:28,Twitter for iPhone,1,27
There is no reason why demands for a border wall should hold up funding for agencies that remain closed. Federal workers are not a bargaining chip.,2019-01-25 01:43:27,Twitter for iPhone,8,41
The House has voted ten times to end the #TrumpShutdown and reopen the government and today the Senate did not end the crisis. Ultimately many federal workers are about to miss their second paycheck because Trump is not getting his way.,2019-01-25 01:37:27,Twitter for iPhone,12,37
I am very pleased to congratulate my colleague @RepAnthonyBrown on his election as Vice Chair of the House Armed Services Committee. He is a committed patriot and his contributions to the work of the Committee and the national security of the United States have been invaluable. https://t.co/aOxBD3cR33,2019-01-23 23:54:00,Twitter Web Client,10,34
It was an honor to meet w/ @SecDef19 Fmr. Senator Sam Nunn &amp; @JerryBrownGov to discuss how the U.S. can move towards a smarter and more responsible approach to nuclear weapons. I appreciate their advocacy and the work of @plough_shares and @NTI_WMD to help make the world safer. https://t.co/VhkbymKox3,2019-01-23 17:01:06,Twitter Web Client,12,28
An entire month of the #TrumpShutdown has left American families wondering how they’ll cover their basic costs of living like rent and groceries. Our local TSA officers and Air Traffic Controllers are rallying today to join the call to #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/4kfS7Ac8Ne,2019-01-23 02:53:08,Twitter for iPhone,8,35

Anyone who is qualified and willing should be allowed to serve their country openly without their career being affected by an arbitrary discriminatory directive from the President. We have fought against this bigoted policy at every step and we will continue to do so.,2019-01-22 17:59:53,Twitter Web Client,32,105
I am extremely disappointed in the Supreme Court's decision to allow the Trump administration to enforce its discriminatory ban on transgender military service without proper due process in the courts. https://t.co/krm2SbzuCK,2019-01-22 17:59:53,Twitter Web Client,28,82
Ensuring that a woman can get insurance coverage for reproductive healthcare —including abortion— is an important part of ensuring economic opportunities. #Roe46,2019-01-22 14:41:47,Twitter Web Client,7,29
46 years ago today the Supreme Court affirmed that women should be able to make decisions about their own health care. The Hyde Amendment continues to take that decision away from women by denying insurance coverage for care. #BeBoldEndHyde,2019-01-22 14:41:47,Twitter Web Client,23,67
Packed house at Garfield High School for today’s @MLKSeattle celebration of the life and legacy of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.     Great to catch up with community legend @Eddie_Rye at the Opportunity Fair! #MLKday https://t.co/HNO8Oy0eSA,2019-01-21 21:31:15,Twitter for iPhone,4,24
Today we celebrate the life and enduring legacy of Martin Luther King Jr. His courage and passion has inspired generations of Americans to advocate for freedom and justice. #MLKDay https://t.co/DpHpZUEZyR,2019-01-21 15:16:46,Twitter for iPhone,10,31
The President can and should re-open the government immediately. Democrats are always open to a fact-based discussion on the issues of border security and immigration reform but the President’s remarks did nothing to advance that discussion.,2019-01-20 02:35:21,Twitter for iPhone,16,62
The President's address failed to express even the slightest concern or support for hundreds of thousands of Americans living w/out paychecks because of this needless shutdown. It is wrong that the President &amp; Congressional Republicans continue to hold workers &amp; families hostage.,2019-01-20 02:35:21,Twitter for iPhone,30,87
