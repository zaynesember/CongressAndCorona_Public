Nursing home residents deserve better. More stringent staffing requirements could not be more urgent.

But nursing homes are often understaffed &amp; mismanaged. A June 2019 @USGAO report found understaffing &amp; insufficient staff training increases residents’ risk of experiencing abuse.

Today I introduced H.R. 4296 the Safe Cosmetics and Personal Care Products Act of 2019 to help ensure the safety of products many of use every day on ourselves and on our children. #safecosmetics @ United States… https://t.co/vQ4sNS3hFC,2019-09-12 19:30:32,Instagram,4,15
Toxic ingredients don’t belong in our beauty care products. We should restore consumer confidence in the safety of beauty and personal care products by making safe cosmetics the new normal. I urge my colleagues to join me in fighting for the passage of this bill. #safecosmetics https://t.co/RpUCaJC0V7,2019-09-12 18:59:26,Twitter Web App,13,34
H.R 4296 is also the only federal bill to directly address the fact that communities of color and professional salon workers are over-exposed to toxic cosmetic chemicals and provide money to help respond to the problem #safecosmetics,2019-09-12 18:59:25,Twitter Web App,7,17
H.R. 4296 is the only federal bill that holds all cosmetic and personal care product companies fully accountable for the safety of their ingredients and offers full transparency to consumers and professional salon workers. #safecosmetics,2019-09-12 18:59:25,Twitter Web App,4,14
These chemical ingredients include coal tar dyes formaldehyde asbestos parabens and phthalates. Human exposures have been linked to cancer infertility miscarriage poor infant &amp; maternal health outcomes obesity asthma and many other serious health concerns #safecosmetics,2019-09-12 18:59:25,Twitter Web App,4,11
Did you know @US_FDA has no authority to regulate the $84 billion cosmetics industry that uses roughly 12500 unique chemicals in their products?   Americans use about 12 personal care products each day resulting in exposure to an average of 168 unique chemicals. #safecosmetics,2019-09-12 18:59:24,Twitter Web App,6,15
