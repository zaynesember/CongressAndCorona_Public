Trump is bulldozing through Native American sacred sites and burial grounds to build his disastrous border wall.

Under DeVos defrauded borrowers from for-profit colleges could be denied relief even when for-profits clearly violated the law.

The Senate must demand that the White House provide documents and produce witnesses who were blocked from testifying in the House investigation. Anything short of this will be engaging in the President's cover-up. https://t.co/wmZWZ3Fu4g,2020-01-16 16:25:06,Hootsuite Inc.,10,32

Border communities have shown these children and families the only compassion and human empathy they have experienced in this country.

Trump and his cronies cannot be trusted to faithfully abide by the law—especially on questions concerning the border &amp; immigration. He is not concerned with how many children live in squalor as long as it serves his twisted political agenda. https://t.co/dwKfj6Read,2019-06-26 02:07:15,Twitter Web Client,1,4
Trump’s cruel policies have manufactured a crisis at the border and desperate asylum-seeking children &amp; parents are paying the price.

Federal workers are on the hook for work expenses they incurred on their personal credit cards--leaving many without the funds to pay them. Our federal workers can't wait for Trump's petulance to subside. It's time to #EndTheShutdown now. https://t.co/osmBWV3UUe,2019-01-23 17:15:15,Hootsuite Inc.,9,16
CMS's stretch of the law is in line with Trump's distortion of facts. This administration will be held accountable for their actions &amp; that includes revealing their illegal distortion of Congressional intent in order to rip away people’s health insurance. https://t.co/bPaK4Pu7Ox,2019-01-22 22:45:09,Hootsuite Inc.,12,12
The #TrumpShutdown continues to wreak havoc on America's most vulnerable families. Without critical housing subsidies and SNAP benefits many may be forced out of their homes and face food insecurity.

The #DACA program has successfully protected 800000 young people from deportation and allowed them to work study and join the military. It's time for Congress to take action to permanently protect them. #DefendDACA https://t.co/4kmlJ5Utnj,2019-01-22 21:15:09,Hootsuite Inc.,4,15
Anyone willing to serve in our military should be able to openly serve. Trump's bigoted policies have no place in our country and it's time for Congress to take legislative action to protect our transgender brothers and sisters from discrimination. https://t.co/zmwz6oQ8Bj,2019-01-22 20:25:07,Hootsuite Inc.,24,83
Today is the anniv. of Roe v. Wade a landmark case that legalized abortion &amp; reaffirmed the rights of women to make their own health decisions.

Trump's decision to hold the livelihoods and paychecks of federal workers hostage to extract a ransom payment for his useless wall is disgraceful.

By gradually raising the minimum wage from $7.25 to $15 by 2024 we are working toward an America where everyone can succeed not just the wealthy few. It's why I'm proud to cosponsor the #RaiseTheWage Act and put money back in the pockets of our workers. https://t.co/3NDFHJO7eU,2019-01-22 16:55:15,Hootsuite Inc.,17,55
Great crowd and atmosphere at the #TucsonWomensMarch earlier today!  Events like these reaffirm that our community will always stand up to the division and bigotry sewed by the current administration with unity and solidarity. https://t.co/ld4Ypn1iYR,2019-01-21 02:39:22,Twitter for iPhone,20,78
