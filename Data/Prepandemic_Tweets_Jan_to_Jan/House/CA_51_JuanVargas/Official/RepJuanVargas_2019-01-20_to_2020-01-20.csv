Thank you @GavinNewsom for visiting our border community. @realDonaldTrump’s fake national emergency is nothing more than an attempt to undermine the will of Congress and the American people. https://t.co/B2i31kg2kS,2019-03-07 19:36:44,Twitter Web Client,9,60
Israel has and remains a stalwart ally of the United States because of our countries’ shared interests and values. I condemn her remarks and believe she should apologize for her offensive comments. (2/2),2019-03-04 18:27:00,Twitter Web Client,659,2817
It is disturbing that Rep. Omar continues to perpetuate hurtful anti-Semitic stereotypes that misrepresent our Jewish community. Additionally questioning support for the U.S.-Israel relationship is unacceptable. (1/2),2019-03-04 18:27:00,Twitter Web Client,2713,8835

Thank you @LeaderHoyer for coming to #CA51 and touring our border region to learn how the Trump Administration's problematic policies are hurting our communities and adding unnecessary barriers to the asylum process.,2019-02-23 01:11:55,Twitter Web Client,4,21

Making asylum seekers stay in a country that is foreign to them contradicts the founding principles of our nation. As a world leader the U.S. should be modeling how to treat the world’s most vulnerable populations.,2019-02-22 22:06:05,Twitter for iPhone,4,18
Contrary to its name the #MPP policy does not protect migrants it only makes their asylum journey more difficult. I’m with @LeaderHoyer at a shelter to learn how this new policy is negatively impacting the lives of migrants. https://t.co/1xVfNb0Ogn,2019-02-22 20:49:12,Twitter for iPhone,8,24

Since taking office President Trump has selfishly put his interests ahead of those of the American people.

In 1993 the Family and Medical Leave Act transformed lives across our nation. 26 years later millions of workers are still forced to choose between putting food on the table or taking care of a loved one. We need the #FAMILYAct now.,2019-02-12 20:00:15,Twitter Web Client,5,13
