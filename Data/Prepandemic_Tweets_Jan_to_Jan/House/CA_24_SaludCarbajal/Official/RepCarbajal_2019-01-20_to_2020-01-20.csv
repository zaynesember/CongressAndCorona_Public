The House passed 3 bipartisan bills to protect against big oil including one that encompasses my bill the California Clean Coast Act. https://t.co/4K9EGnxVPe,2019-09-13 21:06:44,Twitter Web App,7,24
This is unacceptable. I’ve already brought this issue up with local state and federal VA leadership. This week I asked the @VetAffairsDems to take on this issue—our brave veterans deserve far better than this.,2019-09-13 13:56:09,Twitter Web App,1,8
@VetAffairsDems Congress @DeptVetAffairs and @HUDgov established the HUD-Veteran Affairs Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) program to provide rental assistance for homeless veterans.    I recently learned that #CA24 veterans in the HUD-VASH program are facing delays because the VA is understaffed.,2019-09-13 13:56:09,Twitter Web App,1,6
This week I testified before @VetAffairsDems about a very troubling reality: veterans' inability to afford housing especially in California.   On any given night over 39000 veterans are homeless across America—25% of them reside in California. https://t.co/mxJqqR5gLH,2019-09-13 13:55:27,Twitter Media Studio,6,15
Great time at the California State Society's Back to College Night! #CA24 is home to several highly ranked universities and colleges⁠—it was great seeing some of them in D.C. last night.

While we are starting to get answers many questions remain. I'm grateful for the work of @NTSB_Newsroom. As they build a full report my office will support in any way we can.

In 2017 Republicans used the #GOPTaxScam to open the door for harmful oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.  Today @HouseDemocrats are voting to defend public lands stop big oil and #ProtectTheArctic from fossil fuel interests. Let's pass this bill. https://t.co/bK3vCFt6Ci,2019-09-12 15:33:57,Twitter Web App,6,15
I'm proud to have worked with @NRDems Chairman @RepRaulGrijalva and @RepCunningham to ensure our coasts are protected from future oil drilling. Our climate and future depend on it.   Let's pass this bill.,2019-09-11 17:36:27,Twitter Web App,1,7
@RepCunningham #CA24 has experienced the severe impacts of oil spills on our economy wildlife and environment—from the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill to the 2015 Refugio oil spill.  Corporate profits and big oil should NEVER be put above the health and safety of our community.,2019-09-11 17:36:27,Twitter Web App,1,8
HAPPENING NOW: The House is passing three offshore oil ban bills including @RepCunningham's Coastal and Marine Economies Protection Act.   This bill includes my legislation the California Clean Coast Act which prohibits future oil and gas leasing off California’s coastline. https://t.co/gHfJh6OoDV,2019-09-11 17:35:45,Twitter Media Studio,14,58
.@HouseDemocrats are doing our job.

No amount of money can repay 9/11 victims and their families but permanently reauthorizing the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund is a start.  I was proud to help pass this bill in the House earlier this year and I’m glad to see it was signed into law.,2019-09-11 12:46:10,Twitter Web App,1,10

Racism xenophobia and homophobia play a role in the gun violence epidemic. @davidcicilline's Disarm Hate Act prevents individuals convicted of a hate crime from obtaining a firearm.  I'm proud to be a cosponsor of this bill which is also being marked up in @HouseJudiciary today.,2019-09-10 15:45:36,Twitter Web App,4,8
.@RepTedDeutch's Keep Americans Safe Act gets straight to the point:  It keeps Americans safe by banning high-capacity magazines—the piece of assault weapons that makes them so deadly.   I am a supporter of this bill and I look forward to it passing through @HouseJudiciary.,2019-09-10 15:45:36,Twitter Web App,5,8
Extreme risk laws work—they ensure individuals at risk of harming themselves or others don't have access to firearms.   My bipartisan #ERPOAct has broad support and saves lives.

Suicide prevention is deeply personal for me—when I was young my sister took her life with a gun.   As a member of Congress I know it is my duty to do my part in preventing these tragedies. #NotOneMore person should die by guns.

Tomorrow @POTUS will address the nation at the #SOTU2019. Over the last two years the President's actions have spoken far louder than his words but I'm hoping he will go beyond fear-mongering and offer bipartisanship and compromise.  Here's what I'm watching for tomorrow: https://t.co/Zt6QNSRbt4,2019-02-05 03:22:28,Twitter for iPhone,4,17
Erik &amp; @FoodbankSBC have a long history of working to combat food insecurity in our community. They recently helped feed families of 458 federal workers who had nowhere else to turn during the 35-day shutdown. Grateful he will join me at #SOTU tomorrow.  https://t.co/23aQETDQXs,2019-02-04 15:40:31,TweetDeck,6,15
I recently voted for $1.6 billion in strategic border security measures and as negotiations continue I will support expanding this funding for smart and effective solutions that do not rely on a costly and ineffective wall.,2019-02-04 14:36:47,Twitter Web Client,1,6
When I visited a @CBP facility in New Mexico earlier this month I spoke with agents about the need for better technology more personnel &amp; improved infrastructure at our ports of entry. They never mentioned a wall which is a antiquated solution to a modern problem. https://t.co/wohyX4sFXL,2019-02-04 14:36:46,Twitter Web Client,5,10
Erik and the Santa Barbara County Foodbank have a long history of working to combat food insecurity in our community and they recently stepped up to help feed the families of 458 federal workers who had nowhere else to turn during the 35 day government shutdown.,2019-02-02 21:32:43,Twitter for iPhone,1,17

Federal employees staff VA hospitals help Central Coast families navigate their Medicare &amp; Social Security benefits &amp; preserve our public land. This adjustment comes in addition to the locality pay increase for San Luis Obispo employees which went into effect earlier this month,2019-01-30 20:38:41,Twitter Web Client,0,5
The #TrumpShutdown left 800000 of our federal employees without pay for over a month. Today I gladly joined my colleagues in voting to recognize their dedication &amp; specialized skill set by lifting the federal worker pay freeze to give our federal workforce a long-overdue raise.,2019-01-30 20:38:41,Twitter Web Client,0,7
My first priority is to ensure the safety of Central Coast residents while the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant is in operation and to ensure it's decommissioning funding requirements are met. https://t.co/fdcZxaLWC8,2019-01-30 20:36:17,Twitter Web Client,1,7
In light of PG&amp;E’s bankruptcy filing I have written to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to clarify how this development will affect the commission’s oversight of the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant in San Luis Obispo. https://t.co/JgEXXIMUlE,2019-01-30 20:36:16,Twitter Web Client,0,5
@RepTedDeutch My family’s rescue cats Jeeps and Peeps support the #PACTAct too because it helps prevent animal cruelty and torture. They’re glad I’m working to #ProtectOurPets. https://t.co/rkQJBgzAHf,2019-01-30 14:17:30,Twitter Web Client,5,21
Now @POTUS has threatened to invoke a national emergency and redirect funding away from military construction projects that would benefit the men and women who serve our nation every day in order to fund his senseless border wall. https://t.co/yBO6SvcVZu,2019-01-30 02:09:06,Twitter Web Client,13,15
Last year I received a call from a Central Coast family exposed to high levels of lead while living on-base in military housing. Allowing our servicemembers to live in such dilapidated conditions is a disgrace &amp; I wrote to @DeptofDefense requesting funding to address the issue.,2019-01-30 02:09:06,Twitter Web Client,1,16
Glad to report I received a 100% rating from @EqCA for my legislative record last year!

Today is the 10th anniversary of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act which brought us closer to ensuring everyone regardless of their gender receives equal pay for equal work.    I know there’s even more work to be done which is why I’m a cosponsor of the #PaycheckFairness Act. https://t.co/QktbSA1R98,2019-01-29 23:29:25,Twitter Web Client,9,26
In the face of unrelenting attacks on our environment it's more important than ever to reject oil leasing &amp; development off our shores. That’s why I’m re-introducing the California Clean Coast Act which prohibits future oil drilling off the coast of California. https://t.co/kbP3nlMsUz,2019-01-28 21:08:30,Twitter Web Client,1,12
50 years ago today the Santa Barbara oil spill devastated our coastline’s vibrant ecosystem and handicapped our local economy for several months. Our coastal community and communities across California cannot afford another disastrous oil spill.,2019-01-28 21:08:30,Twitter Web Client,2,12
I’m glad @realDonaldTrump finally agreed to reopen the government until mid-February. It looks just like the deal we passed weeks ago to keep government open through mid-February.   This was a completely unnecessary shutdown that hurt millions of Americans.,2019-01-25 19:30:35,Twitter for iPhone,20,45
This shutdown is an unconscionable threat to our national security. @POTUS and @senatemajldr need to reopen the government and stop negotiating on the backs of those who work every day to keep us safe.,2019-01-25 00:16:51,Twitter Web Client,7,21
This shutdown has left @uscoastguard members w/o paychecks food allowances or housing allowances. Last week I met with Coast Guard servicemembers stationed in Morro Bay to hear their stories firsthand and discuss the resources available to them. https://t.co/v5XsFfu6bk,2019-01-25 00:16:51,Twitter Web Client,4,17

I had to reschedule my town hall on the Central Coast this week to stay in Washington DC and keep working to end the senseless #TrumpShutdown. But I still want to hear from you!

I just voted for the 10th time to reopen government while @POTUS &amp; @SenateMajLdr continue to hold 800000 federal workers hostage. It’s time to #EndTheShutdown and get federal employees back to work serving the American people and receiving the pay they are due. https://t.co/a5YmrrvRj9,2019-01-23 22:15:53,Twitter Web Client,16,78

46 years ago today #RoevWade made abortion legal in the US and solidified a woman’s right to make decisions about her own body &amp; future on her own terms.    Since then this right has come under attack but I promise to keep fighting for reproductive freedom for all. https://t.co/wbvdLf96Ld,2019-01-23 03:12:20,Twitter Web Client,3,19
I urge the President to reopen the government immediately so we can continue negotiating border security funding without denying hard-working federal employees their paychecks.,2019-01-23 00:44:46,Twitter Web Client,4,9
The latest proposal includes changes to the legal asylum system that would only exacerbate the chaos at the border keeps his senseless demand for a $5.7 billion border wall &amp; provides only temporary protection for only a fraction of our nation’s #Dreamers.,2019-01-23 00:44:45,Twitter Web Client,3,4
.@POTUS has talked a big game about “good faith” negotiations but his latest proposal is far from a compromise – it's a sham.   You don't have to take it from me 👇https://t.co/MX55Nbg2Cd,2019-01-23 00:44:45,Twitter Web Client,4,13

Discriminating against those who want to step up &amp; serve our country not based on their readiness to serve but solely on their gender identity is bigoted.
