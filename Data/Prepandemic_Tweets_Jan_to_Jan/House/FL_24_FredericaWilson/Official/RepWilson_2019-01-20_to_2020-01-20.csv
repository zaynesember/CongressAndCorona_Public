It is my sincere hope that Haiti’s leaders will soon be able to implement reforms to address their citizens’ worries and economic distress. Congress must stand ready to support the Haitian people however we can! https://t.co/HfXWbKPidA,2019-10-04 18:30:00,TweetDeck,16,56
I have witnessed firsthand the devastating toll that natural and man-made disasters have taken on Haiti which is why I know how desperately the island nation needs the support of the international community to rebuild. https://t.co/nHrlLZrMMK,2019-10-04 17:47:54,TweetDeck,8,35
Our Haitian neighbors deserve our attention and support. @SpeakerPelosi and I held a round table on the unrest in Haiti to shine a spotlight on this humanitarian crisis and discuss what more the U.S. can do. https://t.co/17VKbvnCtE,2019-10-04 17:46:38,TweetDeck,19,45

At the #Haiti roundtable I hosted Carline Paul told @SpeakerPelosi and me that “the people of Haiti say ‘No interference. No [Temporary Protected Status] deportations after Jan. 20 no more support of President Jovenel Moïse as president of Haiti." https://t.co/14fplynfSN,2019-10-04 15:48:44,Twitter Media Studio,4,11
Karen Andre of @NAAHPHaiti said "Where is the PetroCaribe money? Haitians are calling for accountability from so-called elected officials. They are calling for a stop to the massacres the extrajudicial killings that are happening." https://t.co/UAsd1I1Gdy,2019-10-04 15:40:11,Twitter Media Studio,6,5
@MarleineBastien of @FANMOrg is disturbed by the world's silence on  #Haiti. "Why is the world so silent about what’s going on in Haiti? Why is the world silent about the massacres? The Haitian people are suffering. They are asking for our support. They are dying" she said. https://t.co/HkxjNOLXEe,2019-10-04 15:34:35,Twitter Media Studio,3,3

Hosted a forum on Haiti last night. Haitian's believe their president is corrupt. They cannot access gasoline so they are protesting in the streets. We've got to find a solution to stop the protests or we’ve got to find a way to remove Moïse. It’s just that simple. https://t.co/mwZ0NhIS90,2019-10-04 14:36:13,Twitter Media Studio,13,51

House Democrats are taking steps to pass a bill to lower prescription drug prices. No one should have to ration their meds or do without food or utilities to pay for prescriptions. Here's what I said at an @EdLaborCmte hearing I chaired this week. #LowerDrugCosts #ForThePeople https://t.co/OJRBxSaHyr,2019-09-27 21:38:58,Twitter Media Studio,19,73

The Lower Drug Costs Now Act caps negotiated drug prices at prices charged in other nations so that drug companies stop ripping off Americans while charging consumers in other countries less for the same drugs. #LowerDrugCosts https://t.co/1ZqAMyG6cu,2019-09-26 19:29:47,Twitter Web App,6,18

Pay equity is not a moral imperative it is critical to boost women’s financial security. Based on today’s wage gap a woman who worked full-time year round would lose $406760 over a 40-year career. #PaycheckFairnessAct https://t.co/6l6ECI4dtD,2019-04-02 18:45:00,Twitter Media Studio,5,10

E. All of the above? https://t.co/rYOnbXFYiw,2019-01-25 20:05:17,Twitter Web Client,28,138
Thanks to the leadership of @SpeakerPelosi the president is getting a crash course on how government actually works! #WelcomeToTheRealWorld https://t.co/ZJ7RVK8xFs,2019-01-25 20:02:48,Twitter Web Client,33,129
While it is extremely unfortunate that hundreds of thousands of hardworking Americans like Carmen had to experience such unnecessary pain I am grateful that the government is reopening and they will get paid. It's also imperative to avoid another #TrumpShutdown in 3 weeks! https://t.co/aXtdw9t1EG,2019-01-25 19:53:47,Twitter Media Studio,28,81
Boko Haram must be stopped and their victims must never be forgotten. I am grateful to have my colleague's support for efforts to combat Boko Haram and condemn them for their heinous acts including the abduction of the #ChibokGirls. #BBOG https://t.co/cmoyE9ZSAe,2019-01-25 16:33:58,Twitter Media Studio,22,61
Every time you hear a Republican blame this #TrumpShutdown on Democrats watch this video. https://t.co/04H81tIScT,2019-01-24 18:28:56,Twitter Media Studio,137,237

Et tu @SecretaryRoss? Another "Let them eat cake" moment from the Trump administration. https://t.co/1QIbAdr17y,2019-01-24 16:37:19,Twitter Web Client,52,119

The #TrumpShutdown has lasted more than a month. It’s time for @realDonaldTrump to stop holding American families &amp; our economy hostage as he seeks to build his wasteful ineffective wall. #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/R67d4I5HgT,2019-01-23 18:03:09,Twitter Media Studio,5,15
I’m all for smart border security – but Trump’s wall isn’t that. It’s ineffective. It’s wasteful. And the way he’s going about trying to get it is hurting American families. #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/WESkiDFi6q,2019-01-23 18:01:30,Twitter Web Client,13,43
The #TrumpShutdown is making us less secure not more. FBI agents can't pay their bills—and the shutdown is even endangering their ability to do their jobs track down criminals and keep us safe. It’s time to #EndTheShutdown! https://t.co/TEPno2mW80,2019-01-23 17:57:17,Twitter Web Client,24,47
We are still fighting for each of the 112 #ChibokGirls in Boko Haram's captivity and refuse to give up hope. #BringBackOurGirls https://t.co/xGTNEjrQMi,2019-01-23 14:46:12,Twitter Media Studio,15,51
#RoevWade moved our country forward by recognizing a woman’s right to choose. Forty-six years later we’re still fighting to protect this landmark decision and Republican attacks on women's health care. #RoeAt46 https://t.co/kKYWn9aZgX,2019-01-22 20:36:02,Twitter Web Client,24,62
An entire month of the #TrumpShutdown has left American families wondering how they’ll cover their basic costs of living like rent &amp; groceries. @realDonaldTrump enough is enough. #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/sT2wwILSHS,2019-01-22 19:01:24,Twitter Web Client,155,335
.@realDonaldTrump claims he forced the #TrumpShutdown to keep Americans safe. But with the men and women of federal law enforcement and our homeland security community (Coast Guard FBI DEA and more) going without pay he’s making us less safe not more. #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/kLyNRiU8oq,2019-01-22 18:59:42,Twitter Web Client,36,64
ICYMI: I seriously doubt that there is anything the Trump administration has done that Dr. King would have approved of. https://t.co/R03vzdFSmu,2019-01-22 16:55:39,Twitter Web Client,12,52

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. lit a fire that still burns today. We honor his legacy best through action by taking up his torch and striving to realize the ideals of racial and economic justice for which he gave his life. #MLKDay https://t.co/OPsclZ7teW,2019-01-21 20:06:35,Twitter Media Studio,49,123

My colleagues and I will not allow the #ChibokGirls to be forgotten and remain committed to #BringBackAllOurGirls. https://t.co/tIT8pKg2TT,2019-01-20 19:27:21,Twitter Media Studio,25,67
The offer made by @realDonaldTrump to extend DACA and TPS rings hollow since he's the one who ended them for no reason in the first place! https://t.co/LL3wQMSw8k,2019-01-20 18:52:38,Twitter Web Client,245,692
One of the most striking aspects of @realDonaldTrump's remarks yesterday was the indefensible lack of any concern expressed for the 800000 federal workers who haven not been paid and those forced to work without pay. Time to end the #TrumpShutdown,2019-01-20 18:51:29,Twitter Web Client,107,319
