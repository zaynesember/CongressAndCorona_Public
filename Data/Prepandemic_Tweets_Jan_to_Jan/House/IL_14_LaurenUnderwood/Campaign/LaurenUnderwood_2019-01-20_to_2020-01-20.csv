I've co-sponsored 8 pieces of legislation so far tackling issues from gun safety to election reform but one near and dear to my heart is H.R. 728 a bipartisan proposal to fund loans scholarships &amp; grants to train the next generation of nurses.  👩🏾‍⚕️👨🏼‍⚕️👩🏽‍⚕️👨🏾‍⚕️👩🏻‍⚕️,2019-01-30 19:09:59,TweetDeck,295,1869
This week marks the 10th anniversary of the signature of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. Today I'm proud to support the #PaycheckFairness Act to bring women in #IL14 and across our country one step closer to equal pay for equal work. What are your stories of pay disparity?,2019-01-30 16:36:01,TweetDeck,171,745
Even my coat needs a coat this winter. (I swear neither I nor anyone on my staff runs Coat Twitter!) Seriously—stay warm out there #IL14 and everyone in the path of this week's deep freeze (the lovely byproduct of a warming Arctic by the way). ❄🌨🧤 https://t.co/8kqaobgIHg,2019-01-30 02:32:04,TweetDeck,96,1042

The deal to reopen the gov't for 3 weeks came after my colleagues and I voted almost a dozen times to make it happen—and it comes with threats to shut down gov't *again* on Feb 15. These reckless games hurt families across #IL14 and our country and they need to stop.,2019-01-28 17:54:35,TweetDeck,278,1454

Let's #EndTheShutdown. Last weekend I heard from federal employees across agencies at 2 roundtables &amp; a rally. Their commitment to the public's safety &amp; security and the sacrifices they're making are profound. I'll keep voting to restore order &amp; fully fund the government. https://t.co/VSWJaMZQ5K,2019-01-23 21:05:22,TweetDeck,84,481
Had a wonderful time in #IL14 last weekend for the Fox Valley Women's March.
