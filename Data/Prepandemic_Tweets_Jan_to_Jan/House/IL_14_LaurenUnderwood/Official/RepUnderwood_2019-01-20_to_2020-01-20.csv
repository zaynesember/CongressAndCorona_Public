Fewer than 100000 people had junk insurance plans at the end of last year—but that’s going to increase to 600000 this year because of the Administration’s efforts to attack the #ACA &amp; offer insurance that leaves Americans’ health and finances vulnerable. https://t.co/kTirf6L8bn,2019-09-17 17:28:50,Twitter Web App,35,54

When you ask a veteran to pick up their contraception every few months rather than just once a year it’s more than just the hassle of a few extra drives to the pharmacy it’s a burden that makes women veterans more susceptible to unintended pregnancies and costs the VA money.,2019-09-12 18:26:51,Twitter Web App,42,188

Today in @EdLaborCmte Republicans talked about their commitment to people w/ pre-existing conditions. Hard to believe after 70+ votes to strip the #ACA of those protections. If they mean what they say I look forward to them joining my legislation to ban junk plans! https://t.co/JVjF0QLZ9a,2019-02-06 19:00:55,Twitter for iPhone,86,282

I’ll join anyone to help make quality healthcare more affordable to improve our nation’s infrastructure and to alleviate new and unfair tax burdens placed upon Illinoisians and I hope Republicans in Congress and the President come to the table with me in those efforts.,2019-02-06 04:00:22,Twitter Web Client,16,106
But Illinoisians don’t need their elected officials dug-in on partisan positions or practicing unreasonable negotiating tactics like shutting down the government. They need us to get to work and work together.,2019-02-06 04:00:04,Twitter Web Client,13,76
Tonight was a unique opportunity to discuss how we can make progress on issues and move our country forward and I was pleased to hear the President mention important things we need to get done for the American people like paid family leave.,2019-02-06 03:59:40,Twitter Web Client,17,89

Tonight I’m thrilled to bring Allie as my very first #SOTU guest. At just 7-years-old Allie lifts up our community of Naperville by leaving handwritten notes and drawings to support domestic violence victims new college students and anyone who may need positive encouragement https://t.co/GE8fXiiTkd,2019-02-05 23:08:33,Twitter for iPhone,265,1628

The Rebuild America’s School Act helps not only our students but also our economy. By investing more than $100 billion in school infrastructure this bill would create 1.9 million good-paying jobs for local workers. #RebuildAmericasSchools,2019-01-30 20:24:59,Twitter Web Client,45,133
Every student regardless of their family’s wealth should have access to a safe welcoming and high-quality public school. That’s why I’m co-sponsoring the Rebuild America’s Schools Act. #RebuildAmericasSchools,2019-01-30 20:18:50,Twitter Web Client,41,187
When it comes to men and women: same work same pay. Period. Proud that every member of the Democratic Caucus has signed on to the Paycheck Fairness Act.,2019-01-30 17:19:42,Twitter Web Client,14,62
Women still only make about 80 cents every $1 earned by a man. That gap is even wider for women of color. Compared to white men African American women are paid 61 cents Latina Women are paid 53 cents and Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander women are paid 62 cents.,2019-01-30 17:19:23,Twitter Web Client,22,47
Today I stood tall with many Democratic women to support #PaycheckFairness and I’m proud that every single member of our caucus has signed on to the Paycheck Fairness Act for #EqualPay. https://t.co/EtIiddhjEC,2019-01-30 17:19:06,Twitter Web Client,59,210
I've heard from families across #IL14 that they're feeling the burden of the state and local tax deduction changes in the Republican Tax Bill. @RepCasten and I are working to get answers from the IRS.,2019-01-30 01:02:56,Twitter Web Client,45,150
Nonpartisan @USCBO says the GOP shutdown cost us $3 billion in economic activity that can’t be recovered. THREE BILLION DOLLARS over partisan politics.   Let’s hope this report marks the end of senseless shutdowns &amp; hurting American workers &amp; families as a negotiating tactic.,2019-01-29 16:29:59,Twitter Web Client,45,113
