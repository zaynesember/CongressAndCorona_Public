Democrats can't help themselves. Since day one impeachment has been a verdict in search of a crime.

This whole impeachment hoax has been pre-arranged to take down @realDonaldTrump. And the Left doesn’t even try to hide it.

Record numbers! 157878000 people are employed in America and 6.3 million new jobs have been created under the leadership of @realDonaldTrump.   @POTUS is focused on job creation &amp; spurring the economy while Democrats whiff on impeachment &amp; confiscating guns.

McCabe lied to investigators over leaking info to the #FakeNewsMedia &amp; thought he could get away with it because he was part of the D.C. elite.

With the signing of the LIFE Act today this event is more significant than simply the enactment of a new law.

This is the Democrat party now – personal intimidation &amp; physical harassment toward those expressing free speech.

Key point: @POTUS @realDonaldTrump &amp; @TheWhiteHouse cooperated fully with the #MuellerReport.   Hard to claim obstruction when the WH provided open access to personnel &amp; documents– Not that lack of evidence has ever stopped @RepAdamSchiff &amp; his circus for making claims. #GameOver,2019-04-18 15:25:10,Twitter for iPhone,18,34

.@SpeakerPelosi’s cancellation of the #SOTU is just the latest refusal by Democrats to hear solutions offered by @POTUS @realDonaldTrump to #SecureOurBorder &amp; reopen the government. Closing the House's doors to our Commander-in-Chief is not a solution. Time to come to the table.,2019-01-23 23:14:16,Twitter Web Client,65,350

.@POTUS @realDonaldTrump has once again made a good faith offer that secures the border and opens the rest of government. Shame on Democrats for their continued unwillingness to even talk putting political fights ahead of the critical need to strengthen border security.,2019-01-21 01:12:37,Twitter for iPhone,43,168
