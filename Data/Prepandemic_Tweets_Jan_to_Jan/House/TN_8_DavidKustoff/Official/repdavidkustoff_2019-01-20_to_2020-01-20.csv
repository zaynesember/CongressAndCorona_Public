In typical @nytimes fashion they distorted the facts to fit their narrative. Our economy is soaring thanks to @realDonaldTrump's tax cuts &amp; that has allowed @FedEx to invest in their employees &amp; our economy.

I strongly condemn yesterday’s attacks on #Israel. Targeting the leader of a terror organization backed by Iran &amp; targeting innocent civilians are very different things.

I introduced a Rural Health Agenda to ensure rural communities like those in W. TN get the healthcare they deserve. I also voted against Pelosi’s undemocratic impeachment resolution.

Since day one this impeachment inquiry has been a closed-door one-sided process.
