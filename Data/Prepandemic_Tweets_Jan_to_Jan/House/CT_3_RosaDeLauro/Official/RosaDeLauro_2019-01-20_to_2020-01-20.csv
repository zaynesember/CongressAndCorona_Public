First #Med4America gives mental health providers incentives to enter the pool. To increase care we must increase the number of providers.

The Family and Medical Leave Act was signed into law 26 years ago today. It was a good first step but it is time to ensure #PaidLeave for all working people. Let’s pass the #FAMILYAct. @SenGillibrand,2019-02-06 20:16:49,Twitter Web Client,22,63

Democrats are working to advance legislation that deals with gun violence in our country.  Congress has a responsibility to address this epidemic. #EnoughIsEnough,2019-02-06 14:30:30,Twitter Web Client,17,43
Looking forward to reintroducing the FAMILY Act next week with @SenGillibrand. #PaidLeave,2019-02-06 03:19:03,Twitter for iPhone,12,69
The FAMILY Act is the gold standard for paid family and medical leave allowing workers up to 12 weeks to take care of a newborn child or take care of themselves or an ill loved one. #FYI #SOTU,2019-02-06 03:06:40,Twitter for iPhone,45,134
If President Trump were serious about protecting patients with pre-existing conditions his administration wouldn’t be fighting in court to gut the Affordable Care Act. #SOTU,2019-02-06 02:59:41,Twitter for iPhone,167,479
NAFTA 2.0 as its currently written needs changes to its core to end outsourcing protect American workers and the environment raise wages and ensure pharmaceutical companies cannot lock in high drug prices.

President Trump’s attempt at expanding the child tax credit left poor and low income families out military families out but opened it up to wealthy members of Congress.  Not good enough. #SOTU,2019-02-06 02:24:37,Twitter for iPhone,16,46
.@realDonaldTrump your #GOPTaxScam was tilted in favor of millionaires billionaires and corporations—not working families.,2019-02-06 02:20:57,Twitter for iPhone,16,50
President Trump’s USDA is looking to impose unnecessary requirements on food stamps that threaten millions of Americans—including children veterans and seniors—access to this crucial anti-hunger program. #SOTU #FactCheck,2019-02-06 02:20:02,Twitter for iPhone,31,55

"Medicare for America... enrolls the uninsured along with everyone on Obamacare and Medicaid in an expanded Medicare plan and then lets individuals and employers buy into it if they choose"  Couldn't have said it better myself. Thanks for highlighting #Med4America @ezraklein! https://t.co/oeNURwOXwT,2019-02-05 15:47:13,Twitter Web Client,13,34
Medicaid varies from state-to-state. That’s why Medicare for America sets a high floor for benefits and services covered under the plan. If states continue to decide what benefits are covered the inequalities in our healthcare system will persist. https://t.co/yZFMjYkSFk,2019-02-04 22:15:46,Twitter for iPhone,12,19
This is appalling and raises serious questions that the Trump Administration needs to answer. As Chair of the Appropriations Subcommittee that funds HHS and the unaccompanied children program I am committed to getting to the bottom of this. -Rosa https://t.co/dXX4N9yWqD,2019-02-04 21:20:47,Twitter for iPhone,24,48
There's so much more to say about Medicare for America. Looking forward to the robust debate and sharing more about the plan as we (w/ @janschakowsky) get ready to reintroduce it this Congress.,2019-02-03 22:22:50,Twitter for iPhone,6,26
On employer-sponsored insurance: some people love theirs others don’t. Our solution: if employers offer gold level coverage great! If not they either have to or they can put their employees on #Med4America and make a contribution. And workers can always choose #Med4America.,2019-02-03 22:22:50,Twitter for iPhone,10,35
It also tackles the Hyde Amendment. Under #Med4America we ensure all reproductive health care is covered. We're also able to end Hyde-like riders for the Indian Health Service women's veterans healthcare and health care in ICE detention facilities.,2019-02-03 22:22:50,Twitter for iPhone,4,24
#Med4America also includes Long-Term Services &amp; Supports as a part of the universal service package. We cannot have a conversation about universal coverage if we do not include robust home and community-based LTSS.,2019-02-03 22:22:49,Twitter for iPhone,10,35
Like its benefits package. Healthcare should not be determined by your zip code. Unfortunately in our current system it is. #Med4America sets a high threshold for benefits so that all Americans get the same covered benefits and services.,2019-02-03 22:22:49,Twitter for iPhone,5,20

More lies from President Trump. Speaker Pelosi is a leader on preventing human trafficking—especially given her strong support for the Violence Against Women Act and the protections it provides women and girls vulnerable to exploitation. https://t.co/3apfcMTnU7,2019-02-03 21:28:02,Twitter for iPhone,96,248

Women and men doing the same job deserve the same pay—period. That’s why Congress needs to pass the #PaycheckFairness Act. Tune in as I reintroduce it with @SpeakerPelosi leading Democrats and national orgs at 9 am ET. #EqualPay https://t.co/mLAg5Md4HC,2019-01-30 12:30:00,TweetDeck,1028,4141

After 34 days of the Trump Shutdown 800000 workers remain furloughed or are working without pay. They are struggling to pay their bills or put food into the table. It’s time for President Trump to stop holding the country hostage and end his shutdown. https://t.co/2ZmJPlv3qf,2019-01-25 04:26:26,Twitter Media Studio,45,147
The Trump Administration has let our nation’s workers down by repealing a key workplace safety rule that kept employers from hiding workplace incidents and injuries. It is imperative that @OSHA_DOL is aware of issues like these so that we can keep workers safe on the job.,2019-01-24 20:01:21,Twitter Web Client,6,20
