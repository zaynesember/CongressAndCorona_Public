In TX we pay a steep price for the crisis on the border. Gangs human trafficking drug smuggling all run right through our own back yard because of a failure to secure it. https://t.co/1BTmtYnIkM,2019-03-06 21:31:34,joe.sentry,3,5
House Republicans will sustain @POTUS’s veto. Congress should have given President Trump the resources already.

Pelosi's opposition to @POTUS's declaration of emergency at our border is fueled only by her partisan hatred. Our porous border has left our nation vulnerable &amp; allowed violent criminals to take the lives of innocent Americans. It must be secured. https://t.co/J16ScQACQU,2019-02-27 17:06:30,Twitter Web Client,1,2
A tax refund has zero to do with a person’s overall tax bill. It merely represents how much you OVERPAID the IRS last year. Our tax reform made sure Americans keep more of their money in each paycheck and don’t have to wait to get it back from the IRS. https://t.co/0VYLI7mrUj,2019-02-25 21:52:30,Twitter Web Client,2,4

which is a redemptive story of how God had to humble him before he could use him.

If Democrats twist the law and weaponize the tax code for the sole purpose of attacking the President they've set a very dangerous precedent. What we're seeing right now is an abuse of power. https://t.co/3lkrrguAg0,2019-02-08 19:22:45,Twitter Web Client,1,6
America’s strong &amp; growing economy along with @POTUS’s renewed call for bipartisanship pave the perfect path for us to help families save more &amp; earlier.

There's no need to elaborate on @POTUS's response to Nancy Pelosi's attempt to cancel the #SOTU. The truth is not on the left's side.
