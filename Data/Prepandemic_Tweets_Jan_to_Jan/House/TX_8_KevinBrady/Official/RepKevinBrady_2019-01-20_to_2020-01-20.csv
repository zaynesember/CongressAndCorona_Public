This is first IRS reform in two decades. Passed by @GOPHouse multiple times last session with near unanimous support. Great bipartisan work! https://t.co/Dvggm6ge8n,2019-04-02 15:04:11,Twitter for iPhone,8,23
2) Reasons cited for seizing Trump tax returns = bogus excuses.  Don't need tax returns. Financial disclosure form can be changed if there are valid bipartisan reasons for additional information from #POTUS or Members of Congress re: conflicts of interest.   #EqualDisclosure,2019-04-01 21:03:02,Twitter Web Client,8,26
Appropriate this published on April 1.   1) #Democrats violating longstanding privacy law if they try to seize @realDonaldTrump tax returns for political purposes. Sets dangerous precedent where future Congress can do same to any political 'enemies.'  https://t.co/wDAkfkgpy3,2019-04-01 20:57:46,Twitter Web Client,14,39
While the SECURE Act doesn't include every provision in the Family Savings Act which passed @GOPHouse twice in 2018 - such as USA Accounts &amp; allowing families to save extra year for soon-to-be newborn - it is a strong package of important reforms.      https://t.co/X3o6fAv9hB,2019-04-01 19:06:55,Twitter Web Client,5,13
More thoughtful bipartisan work. First major reforms of the IRS in two decades.   FYI - this package approved in the @GOPHouse with huge bipartisan support multiple times in 2018. Let’s get to #POTUS desk this year.   https://t.co/aqCWRSUvfk,2019-04-01 15:03:42,Twitter for iPad,9,14
IRS UPDATE: - Ave tax refund = almost same as last year $2195. - % of people recieving refunds: almost same as last year at this time 80.7% - # of claims received/processing: almost same as last year.

Normal to have technical corrections w/overhaul of tax code. Reagan 1986 tax reform generated 250 “technicals”. #GOP tax reform = 80 or so many clerical.

Great bipartisan work to help workers save earlier and more for retirement/health/education. Also helps older workers save longer; more #SmallBiz offer savings plans.

On average state and local governments collect $1518 per person in property taxes. That's why the new $10k limit on SALT deductions is reasonable/fair.

This drives higher wages for workers &amp; more economic oomph for U.S.  When local businesses invest tax free in the technology/equipment/buildings that make their workers more productive paychecks go up.
