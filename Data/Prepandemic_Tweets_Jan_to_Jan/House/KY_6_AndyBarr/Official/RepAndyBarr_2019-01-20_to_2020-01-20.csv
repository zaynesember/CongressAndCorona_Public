However I also have the humility to acknowledge that Congress lacks the power to divest the President of his Commander-in-Chief authorities under Article II.,2020-01-04 23:03:52,Twitter Web App,1,12

This was in recognition of the slow pace and inefficiency of legislative proceedings under the Articles of Confederation.,2020-01-04 23:03:52,Twitter Web App,0,5
Don’t forget the Framers of the Constitution specifically rejected a proposal that Congress be empowered to “make war” and implied power for the President to “repel sudden attacks.”,2020-01-04 23:03:52,Twitter Web App,1,5
Of course that is precisely the scenario here involving the President’s decisive defensive strike against Soleimani in response to the attack on our Embassy.,2020-01-04 23:03:51,Twitter Web App,0,5
Finally according to the OLC “if our Armed Forces otherwise lawfully stationed in a foreign country were fired upon and defended themselves we doubt that such engagement in hostilities would be covered by the consultation and reporting provisions of the War Powers Resolution.”,2020-01-04 23:03:51,Twitter Web App,0,4
Furthermore the War Powers Resolution applies only to the deployment of “significant” bodies of military personnel and would not apply to a drone strike.,2020-01-04 23:03:51,Twitter Web App,0,5
And the War Powers Resolution 50 U.S.C. 1541-48 does not limit the the President’s power to act without Congress.  At most it merely imposes a reporting &amp; consultation requirement on the President until Congress passes a concurrent resolution to terminate the military action.,2020-01-04 23:03:50,Twitter Web App,0,4
The courts have generally declined to review the exercise of such unilateral Executive power.,2020-01-04 23:03:50,Twitter Web App,0,4

But dating back to the Prize Cases in 1863 the Supreme Court has long held that the President may act without Congress to defend the nation.,2020-01-04 23:03:48,Twitter Web App,1,5
It is true that the Constitution gives Congress the sole power to declare war and the sole power of the purse to either fund or defund military action.,2020-01-04 23:03:48,Twitter Web App,0,4
To my colleagues complaining about the absence of explicit congressional authorization for the Soleimani strike a helpful reminder: Article II Section 2 of the Constitution provides: “The President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States.”,2020-01-04 23:03:47,Twitter Web App,9,37

We need to focus on maximum wages not minimum wages.  I want workers to earn a lot more than $15 per hour.  But to give that opportunity to as many workers as possible we need economic growth—not central planning from Washington.,2019-07-18 22:06:10,Twitter for iPhone,19,27
And less than 20 percent of workers who would see a wage increase under this bill actually live in households that earn less than the federal poverty line.   We need to focus on policies that will increase wages for all workers not just minimum wage workers.,2019-07-18 22:06:09,Twitter for iPhone,4,13
Also -  There are mountains of evidence that a higher federally mandated minimum wage leads to fewer workers hired.

A minimum wage hike would have a negative impact on entry-level and part-time jobs especially for those under the age of 25 just starting careers. It would result in $9 billion net reduction in family income. This would NOT help low-income families - it would hurt them.,2019-07-18 16:39:56,Twitter Web Client,3,9
MYTH: Raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour will increase family income. FACT: Raising the minimum wage will reduce pay for many American families.,2019-07-18 16:39:56,Twitter Web Client,2,2
Under the Trump Administration the economy has experienced sustainable and significant job creation. A $15 minimum wage hike would reverse these wins resulting in roughly $3.7 million jobs LOST.,2019-07-18 16:39:55,Twitter Web Client,3,5
