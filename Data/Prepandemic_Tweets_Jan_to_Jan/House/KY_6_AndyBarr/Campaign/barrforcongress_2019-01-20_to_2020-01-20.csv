Law enforcement continues to be one of the most dangerous jobs in America. In 2019 alone we lost 134 officers in the line of the duty - including two in KY. Thank you to those brave men and women who died protecting us and to those who continue to protect us. #BackTheBlue https://t.co/7vocOMaM63,2020-01-09 20:00:07,joe.sentry,7,16
I'm relieved that no Americans were killed or harmed during Tuesday night's attacks by the Iranian regime. As we learn more about the situation @realDonaldTrump continues to have my full support in ensuring Iran is held accountable. https://t.co/PIugl4ylJ4,2020-01-09 16:25:04,joe.sentry,2,7

This morning I filed to run for re-election. We are accomplishing a lot even in the minority and we have more work to do. When it comes to representing our values and advancing a conservative agenda I’m all in. https://t.co/fdw34Yu6rm,2019-12-16 17:25:24,Twitter Web App,15,84

Without any proof that @POTUS did anything wrong Nancy Pelosi is ordering House Democrats to move forward with Articles of Impeachment. Send them a message that it's time to focus on the real issues - not a political witch hunt - by adding your name now! https://t.co/3Cb6Ltl41z,2019-12-06 14:00:05,joe.sentry,7,16
More Americans are rejecting the Left's’ partisan impeachment sham. After 3 years of trying to overturn the 2016 election it is no surprise they are now trying to do the same ahead of 2020. We must keep the pressure on the Dems to abandon this witch hunt. https://t.co/AfDOS8mgPe,2019-12-04 15:00:04,joe.sentry,14,22
I have a lot to be thankful for this year including my happy and healthy family. But I’m also grateful that God has provided us such a beautiful country to live in.

It's become clear that the Democrats are using the partisan impeachment sham as a way to throw @POTUS out of office before the 2020 elections. In other words they're abusing their power just to deny you a choice next year. https://t.co/CgRNgTh0eK,2019-11-19 20:45:32,Twitter Web App,5,17
Today is the beginning of the Left’s fake impeachment hearings against @POTUS. This sham is about denying YOU a vote in 2020 &amp; crippling our agenda to Keep America Great.

I applaud @POTUS' decision to withdraw from the disastrous Paris climate deal. The U.S. is already a global leader in reducing carbon emissions and this deal only threatens our economy and fails to keep high-polluting countries like China accountable. https://t.co/i8iqPk2mYV,2019-11-06 14:00:03,joe.sentry,3,12

Pelosi is more interested in playing political games to obstruct @POTUS's agenda than she is in leading the House. Her campaign for impeachment is yet another move in that game much to the detriment of the American people &amp; their priorities. https://t.co/8aOHIAYTIy,2019-10-23 22:35:04,joe.sentry,0,7

The Democrats are scrambling to find ways to give away more of your hard-earned money and reduce incentives to succeed. Whether it's "free" money or overreaching government programs the result will be more taxes on the middle class. https://t.co/zRQE3r3YF1,2019-08-06 22:05:06,joe.sentry,1,6
Another solid jobs report for July! The Democrats running for office across the Commonwealth and the nation would have you believe our policies haven’t worked.
