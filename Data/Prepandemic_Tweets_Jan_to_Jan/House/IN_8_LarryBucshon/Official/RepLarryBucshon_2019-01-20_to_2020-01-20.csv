To designate life-saving devices as a hazardous substance is inappropriate and will cost American lives.

As it stands H.R. 535 the PFAS Action Act would deny Hoosiers the healing power of modern medical devices using PFAS and instead lead to costly litigation which would increase the underlying costs of healthcare.

@Avik @SenateHELP In addition plans will be incentivized to drop physicians from their network and negotiate lower rates under the threat of providers getting the even lower out of network rate if they don’t sign up.

While averting a government shutdown and funding the government are important I ultimately voted no because key aspects of this bill come up short on providing the necessary resources to secure the border and protect the American people.,2019-02-15 02:10:05,Twitter for iPhone,2,22
Today I met with the @NASA  Supplier Companies from Indiana including @BWXTech. This heavy metal manufacturing company is located in Mount Vernon and employees over 225 Hoosiers.

The facts show drugs are pouring across the border our national security is at risk and there is a humanitarian crisis. I urge Democrats in the House to come together with Republicans in both chambers to pass a bill President Trump will sign.,2019-02-11 16:56:51,Twitter Web Client,1,7

I’m glad the leftists in Hollywood think it is funny that Speaker Pelosi clapped at the President of the U.S. in a condescending way. However disrespecting the Office of the Presidency is a dangerous precedent no matter who is in the office. Be careful what you wish for!,2019-02-11 02:16:53,Twitter for iPhone,24,102

That is why I will be working alongside my fellow pro-life colleagues in the House to end the barbaric practice of infanticide by providing life-saving treatment to babies that survive an attempted abortion by supporting the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act.,2019-02-07 21:33:40,Twitter Web Client,1,8
I am deeply troubled by recent efforts in New York and Virginia to legalize abortion up until the moment of delivery and beyond. I support President Trump’s call to “reaffirm a fundamental truth: all children – born and unborn – are made in the holy image of God.”,2019-02-07 21:33:40,Twitter Web Client,3,21
The fact that Speaker Pelosi didn’t stand and applaud with Republicans and a few Democrats when President Trump said the U.S. will never be a socialist country is very telling. Shocking really.,2019-02-06 04:28:18,Twitter for iPhone,4,29
I stand ready to work with President Trump and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to make the tough decisions needed to help all Americans in the pursuit of their version of the American dream. #SOTU https://t.co/WkMKFONvPA,2019-02-06 03:30:02,Twitter Web Client,7,25

During my work on the Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee I continually focused on private sector market-based solutions that lower costs and will make healthcare more accessible and affordable to all.  I look forward to sharing those solutions with @realDonaldTrump.  #SOTU,2019-02-06 02:56:36,Twitter for iPhone,2,12
As a physician I look forward to partnering with the @WhiteHouse to deliver real health care reform that drives down the cost of health care increases the quality of care and expands access. #AccessforAll #SOTU,2019-02-06 02:54:50,Twitter for iPhone,2,8

Every day more than 100 Americans die from drug related overdoses. The drugs flowing from our southern border have created a national security crisis that threatens the American people. #DrugEpidemic #SOTU,2019-02-06 02:37:51,Twitter for iPhone,6,14

The US economy added 304000 jobs in January and throughout 2018 the average monthly gain was 223000 jobs. This economic boom is no coincidence it is the direct product of the pro-growth policies put in place by President Trump and the Republicans in Congress,2019-02-01 17:25:24,Twitter Web Client,3,6
Thanks to a conservative agenda of cutting taxes and rolling back unnecessary regulations to empower Main Street job creators January marks a record-breaking 100th straight month of job gains. https://t.co/aaATlwjeU3,2019-02-01 17:25:24,Twitter Web Client,3,6

If Speaker Pelosi really believes what she told Congress and the American people last year when she said ‘As Members of Congress we have a moral responsibility to act now to protect DREAMers’ then she would put forth the President’s proposal for a vote in the House tomorrow.,2019-01-24 20:23:16,Twitter Web Client,1,5
