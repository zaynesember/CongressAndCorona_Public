The hardworking men and women of #TN6 are already burdened with too many taxes. Yet they balance their checkbooks and live within their means. The answer is not more taxes -- it’s responsible government. #DemDebate,2019-06-28 02:55:20,Twitter for iPhone,2,8

As an 8th generation farmer I know how out of touch Democrats are with their #GreenNewDeal. It would never work for real Americans. Maybe #TheSwamp should visit the green fields of #TN6 to learn how every day Americans truly live. #DemDebate,2019-06-28 02:20:40,Twitter for iPhone,4,8
The abortion rhetoric in the #DemDebate is no different than what we’ve heard from Washington D.C. New York &amp; Virginia &amp; it is absolutely heartbreaking. Democrats can waste time debating the qualifications for “life” but in #TN6 we know that all babies are a gift from God.,2019-06-28 02:18:10,Twitter for iPhone,3,12
Instead of asking how we can raise taxes we should be asking how we can cut spending. Democrats proposed plans tonight for more reckless spending but for the sake of our children's future we must get back to #fiscalresponsibility. #DemDebate,2019-06-28 02:13:15,Twitter for iPhone,2,11

Dems can continue naming “rights” but that does not change reality. Universal healthcare and a universal minimum wage are not guaranteed by our Bill of Rights but would cost taxpayers $$$.
