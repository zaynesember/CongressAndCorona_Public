Gun violence is a public health crisis. We need to work together with the medical community to support research and data-informed approaches to curbing gun violence: just like we would for any other disease #Building4Us,2019-01-30 18:33:07,Twitter Web Client,34,89
@DrPhilRoe @RepAndyHarrisMD @RepBera Pain management is a complex multifaceted skill that needs to be honed and refined just like any other aspect of a physician’s medical education. Proud to be an original sponsor of this bipartisan effort!,2019-01-30 15:14:58,Twitter Web Client,1,9
Proud to cosponsor the ANTIQUITIES Act legislation that protects national monuments across our nation. Public lands are at the heart of our American identity and we have a responsibility to protect our Desert’s natural beauty for generations to come!,2019-01-30 00:38:00,TweetDeck,10,57
Big and long overdue news for Blue Water Navy veterans! I have fought the VA and supported legislation to provide Blue Navy Veterans the benefits they have earned. I urge the VA and Trump Admin to let this ruling stand. Do not appeal to the Supreme Court! https://t.co/HT22YTA0sW,2019-01-29 22:39:14,Twitter Web Client,9,29
@eqca @RepTedLieu @RepJimmyGomez @NormaJTorres Honored to earn a perfect score on @EQCA’s 2018 legislative scorecard! Looking forward to another year of advocating for the civil rights of LGBTQ+ individuals in our communities and across our nation.,2019-01-29 22:20:05,Twitter Web Client,3,10
Pay discrimination has no place in our nation and we must build on progress made by the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act passed into law ten years ago. Together we can build a more fair and equitable society. https://t.co/qffhxS03Rh,2019-01-29 22:19:23,TweetDeck,2,10
I have cosponsored H.R. 674 the Gun Violence Prevention Research Act which will start to address this by authorizing $50 million for the CDC to research gun violence prevention. #NeverAgain,2019-01-29 00:18:41,TweetDeck,10,27
Gun violence claimed more than 13000 lives in 2018 but our nation has failed to support adequate public health research that could identify the causes and characteristics of gun violence so we can enact policies that save lives – all because of politics and campaign promises.,2019-01-29 00:18:31,TweetDeck,10,42
On Friday I joined FIND Food Bank to hear from federal employees who weren’t paid during the government shutdown and provide them with free meals. Many of these families will continue to feel the shutdown's effects in the weeks ahead. https://t.co/sq1d1Dzo3W,2019-01-28 21:50:33,TweetDeck,2,19
Bottom line this shutdown should never have happened and politicians should never intentionally harm the American people with a shutdown as leverage for political gain.,2019-01-25 22:39:13,Twitter Web Client,2,32
The shutdown will soon be over but the damage from this reckless shutdown will be felt for months and years to come. Families have lost thousands from their retirement incurred late payment fees face higher interest rate penalties and small businesses may never fully recover.,2019-01-25 22:39:13,Twitter Web Client,7,34
Excited to see some familiar faces tomorrow at the Pass Area Veterans Expo! This is a great chance for veterans to learn about the services and benefits available to them.

The uninsured rate reached a four-year high due to President Trump's sabotage of the ACA. This means less care more illness and more costs for everyone. THIS is why I am fighting to #ProtectOurCare and why it is so important for our nation. https://t.co/CqKuzfsh4g,2019-01-25 17:00:00,TweetDeck,8,17
This is the disconnect you get when you have a billionaire-class administration instead of a government of the people. https://t.co/Ilf8vkAYY9,2019-01-24 22:11:01,TweetDeck,8,29
We must heed the warnings of military leaders like Former Secretary of Defense General Mattis to support NATO and our allies. That's why I voted for this bill which prohibits the use of any funds to withdraw the U.S. from NATO. https://t.co/GeIJF9xNZD,2019-01-24 21:06:06,Twitter Web Client,6,20
I am deeply concerned by this recent FBI report. There is a clear path to ending the shutdown: the Senate should pass the bipartisan funding bill they already passed last year and the President should sign it.  https://t.co/GtSiCpIPjH,2019-01-24 00:53:00,TweetDeck,8,28
Volunteers and park rangers are doing everything they can to keep Joshua Tree National Park safe and clean but the government shutdown has taken a toll. A government by and for the people takes care of our public lands. https://t.co/1U8FAL4izD,2019-01-22 20:46:10,Twitter Web Client,11,44
Today we keep Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s legacy alive by standing up to hatred white supremacy and racism. In doing so we embrace the values Dr. King lived: justice equality and the courage to do what is right.,2019-01-21 19:27:00,TweetDeck,2,30
