This is an issue that concerns what kind of country we are. It is something I will continue to highlight push for and fight for until this MPP program has ended once and for all and the inhumanity it has generated with it. (8/8),2020-01-17 22:08:24,Twitter Web App,18,90
He has severely undercut our nation's reputation around the world as the country that upholds the highest moral standards. I would ask that the President go to Matamoros take a first-hand look at what he is responsible for and see the inhumanity for himself. (7/8),2020-01-17 22:08:24,Twitter Web App,19,87
For generations the U.S. has been respected around the world as a beacon of moral clarity and moral rectitude. Unfortunately @realDonaldTrump has fundamentally changed that during his presidency. (6/8),2020-01-17 22:08:23,Twitter Web App,17,73
What I came away with is that the President and this entire Administration are forcing people to live in cruel conditions because of the Remain in Mexico policy—no running water where young children (some 1 2 and 3 years old) are living with their parents in squalor.

There are times when the river overflows because of heavy rain and they are forced to live and sleep in mud. This is shameful. These are conditions that people legally seeking asylum and refuge in the U.S. should not have to endure. They are human beings. (4/8),2020-01-17 22:08:23,Twitter Web App,15,64
Hundreds if not thousands are living in unspeakable and inhumane conditions right on the other side of the border in Matamoros. Seeing those conditions with our own eyes and walking through the border horrified us all. (3/8),2020-01-17 22:08:23,Twitter Web App,20,64
We had a chance to meet with attorney advocates who have been working in tent courts—the judicial process for considering asylum seekers the Trump Administration has set up. Suffice to say the rule of law is not respected. (2/8),2020-01-17 22:08:22,Twitter Web App,14,67
Today I led a delegation of members from the  @HispanicCaucus to Brownsville TX to look at the effects of the President’s Remain in Mexico policy in Matamoros. I want to thank everyone who came with me to highlight this hugely important issue. This is what we found: (1/8) https://t.co/oolTuQsCNx,2020-01-17 22:08:21,Twitter Web App,148,427
Just left the border.   We were able to get a young girl with a heart defect and Down’s Syndrome allowed into the United States with her family while their asylum claim is considered.  She had been denied yesterday. #DemsAtTheBorder,2020-01-17 18:37:18,Twitter Web App,10258,73791
I’d be glad to talk to y’all about the delegation’s visit and everything we see although it will have to be after tmrw because I have to get back to San Antonio after Matamoros. https://t.co/NCKzFmK7U9,2020-01-17 02:09:32,Twitter Web App,16,134

Today @RepSylviaGarcia &amp; I sent a letter to @GregAbbott_TX demanding that he reverse his disgraceful refugee resettlement decision.

Parnas is facing federal indictment. But so are most of the people on @realDonaldTrump's team. That's the company he keeps.

A State Dept. official calls it “insane” and “deeply chilling” that Trump cronies were possibly surveilling Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch. And it is.  I look forward to working with Chairman Engel and my colleagues on @HouseForeign to investigate these deeply disturbing charges. https://t.co/1RdJm2D2Xo,2020-01-15 20:13:01,Twitter Web App,152,563
This new evidence from our investigation at @HouseIntel affirms @realDonaldTrump &amp; his associates’ efforts to apply pressure on President Zelensky to investigate the Bidens. It also affirms our decision to impeach the President. I urge the Senate to take it very seriously. https://t.co/CVIm9CTQRQ,2020-01-15 19:01:18,Twitter Web App,65,219
Vladimir Putin is demonstrating what dictators do by undermining any remnants of accountability in Russia. We must take care to never normalize President Trump’s adoration of Putin and his way of rule. https://t.co/W0v0Jov1rO,2020-01-15 17:40:52,Twitter Web App,76,316
There’s been deep corruption among Texas’ state leadership — huge no bid contracts pay-to-play politics sweetheart deals for cronies that made them rich.   Should the federal government stop sending money to Texas because of that? Or is it just Puerto Rico? https://t.co/A9vJPDXo56,2020-01-15 12:48:27,Twitter Web App,127,483
Puerto Rico still recovering from Hurricane Maria has been devastated by recent earthquakes.  People have died. Medicine food and water are hard to come by. Many are fighting to survive.  Yet President Trump is holding back billions in aid.   Release the aid for Puerto Rico! https://t.co/oyOo94qVTV,2020-01-14 21:17:29,Twitter Web App,312,622
This is (one reason) why I voted against the DHS/Defense appropriations bill — there was no transfer restriction in the bill to prevent President Trump from stealing billions from other accounts to fund his border wall.   And that’s exactly what he’s doing now. https://t.co/UfgKfdx1Zh,2020-01-14 20:36:40,Twitter Web App,78,244
I want to thank former deputy National Security Advisor Avril Haines @CFR_org President @RichardHaass and former National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley for testifying.  That said my colleagues and I still expect to hear from @SecPompeo promptly. (2/2),2020-01-14 17:21:14,Twitter for iPhone,14,82
In today's @HouseForeign hearing we are making sense of the chaos that @realdonaldtrump created in Iraq. We extended an invite to @SecPompeo who unacceptably refused to testify. He has an obligation to the American people to shed light on the Administration’s actions. (1/2) https://t.co/2rl8QuhWgO,2020-01-14 17:21:13,Twitter for iPhone,66,181
@ksatnews @AFLCIO These are some of the reasons I cannot support the further expansion of collective bargaining specifically for police unions across the country. Not until the disciplinary process is fixed and bad officers are properly held accountable.,2020-01-13 03:58:24,Twitter Web App,15,125
@ksatnews I also believe the umbrella unions such as the @AFLCIO have a responsibility to speak up to help change this.,2020-01-13 03:43:16,Twitter Web App,15,112
@ksatnews Police unions too often stand by bad officers regardless of how bad they’ve acted. It severely undermines public trust.,2020-01-13 03:40:50,Twitter Web App,38,217

This is a serious moment in our country. Every American owes a debt of gratitude to our military for its sacrifice. For that reason a decision that risks troops’ wellbeing must only be made thoughtfully &amp; with the informed consent of the public and this Congress. @HouseForeign https://t.co/pr6UOT5Ej2,2020-01-10 15:52:34,Twitter Media Studio,102,505

I spoke with Ambassador Espina on Dec 30.

Throughout the impeachment investigation President Trump obstructed Congress by unlawfully blocking witnesses from testifying.

When @realDonaldTrump pulled the U.S. out of the Iran nuclear agreement he promised he’d get us a “better deal.”  Instead he’s only pushed us closer to conflict and Iran even closer to nuclear weapons. https://t.co/J6p1LytrA7,2020-01-05 19:05:05,Twitter for iPhone,440,1621
There’s the old adage in politics that you trust but verify. But @realDonaldTrump has told thousands of lies. So with this Administration we have to verify and then perhaps trust. Congress needs to see what intelligence they used to make this decision.  https://t.co/lVcrEj2S9A,2020-01-05 14:50:23,Twitter for iPhone,92,387
