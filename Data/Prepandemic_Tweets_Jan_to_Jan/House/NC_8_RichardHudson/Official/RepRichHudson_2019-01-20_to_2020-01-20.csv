I’ll work with anyone to end gun violence while also protecting the rights of law-abiding citizens – and I reject the false dilemma that we can't do both. https://t.co/GRFqK1HDt2,2019-02-26 22:47:16,Twitter Web Client,2,13
So what is #HR8 actually going to do? It would have done nothing to prevent recent mass violence but would restrict the rights of law-abiding Americans. #2A #SecondAmendment https://t.co/Ydg4pbZouJ,2019-02-26 22:42:46,Twitter Web Client,2,12
In their rush to "do something" House Democrats ignore that House Republicans have done many things like strengthening the background check system; improving mental health care; and giving schools the tools they need to protect students. https://t.co/vntdJPGdqM,2019-02-26 22:37:46,Twitter Web Client,0,7
The proponents of gun control don’t want you to judge them based on outcomes; they want you to judge them based on intentions. https://t.co/yZl3OK016k,2019-02-26 22:33:29,Twitter Web Client,3,8
It’s a shame that in their rush to “do something” – anything – House Democrats have made this a partisan show. They won’t even allow my bipartisan #ConcealedCarryReciprocity bill that passed this House last Congress to be debated on the House floor today. #HR38,2019-02-26 22:29:27,Twitter Web Client,169,471
Voiced my strong opposition to HR8 &amp; HR1112. Instead of working on common sense solutions that can actually help prevent tragedies—like supporting LEOs ensuring laws are followed &amp; improving mental health—House Dems are targeting law-abiding citizens.  https://t.co/d5yCRgb2OX,2019-02-26 22:27:51,Twitter Web Client,1,4

House Dems blocked a discussion on the House floor about #concealedcarryreciprocity – my bipartisan bill that passed the House in 2017. Instead of talking about solutions that could actually reduce gun violence they’re moving bills that do nothing to address the real problems. https://t.co/Zo3UsxXppo,2019-02-26 16:39:02,Twitter Web Client,3,7

We all want to end gun violence &amp; should be looking at common sense solutions—like supporting LEOs ensuring laws are followed improving mental health &amp; implementing my #concealedcarryreciprocity bill.
