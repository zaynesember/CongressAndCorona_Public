“Crow an Aurora Democrat who made gun control a focal point of his campaign last year said Coloradans cannot complacently accept the environment of gun violence &amp; school shootings that forced Denver parents to tell their kids about Wednesday’s closures.” https://t.co/1ZCGix5Ecs,2019-04-18 02:20:55,Twitter for iPhone,22,106
Small businesses are the backbone of our economy and #CO06 is exhibit A of that. Had a fantastic time touring Precision Clinical Labs and learning more about what Congress can do to help our small businesses.  https://t.co/RZZ7LdukRz,2019-04-16 13:16:36,Twitter for iPhone,3,17

Humbled &amp; proud to share that we raised $490000 in Q1 - all without a dime from corporate PACs.   They told us we could never flip the sixth but we did &amp; now we're working everyday to deliver on our promise of a new generation of leadership.   Thank you. https://t.co/F3tj2wLVEN,2019-04-11 11:50:24,Twitter for iPhone,12,156

On Feb. 20 I sent Sec. Nielsen questions on the medical conditions at the Aurora ICE facility.   Since then she never responded and has now quit her job.  In the meantime I’ve been leading the charge to increase transparency at ICE detention centers.   https://t.co/4lxH5ktiSK,2019-04-10 02:54:12,Twitter for iPhone,26,109

I believe everything we do must be driven by the needs of the district. That’s why I launched “Lead Locally” a new initiative to visit every city in #CO06.   This March we visited Thornton.

We ran on gun violence prevention when everyone said we were crazy to do so. But we can’t be afraid to stand up to the gun lobby. Congress is making history with #HR8.
