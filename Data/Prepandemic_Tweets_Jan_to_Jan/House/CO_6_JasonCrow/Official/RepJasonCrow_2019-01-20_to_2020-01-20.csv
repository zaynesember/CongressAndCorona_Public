While there is no map for the challenges we face my oath to support and defend the Constitution has guided me and will continue to guide me during this trial. It is the duty of Congress to protect the rule-of-law and hold the President accountable. Our democracy depends on it.,2020-01-15 21:01:10,Twitter Web App,64,387
I love our country and what it represents both at home and around the world. My time in military service taught me that our democracy exists because men &amp; women stand up to fight for it. It’s a belief that drove me to serve my country in combat and led me to the halls of Congress,2020-01-15 21:01:09,Twitter Web App,54,364

I’ve often heard it’s not the time to discuss America's use of force -- in 2003 as I was carrying a rifle in Iraq. In 2005 when I was leading my unit in Afghanistan. And today in Congress.
