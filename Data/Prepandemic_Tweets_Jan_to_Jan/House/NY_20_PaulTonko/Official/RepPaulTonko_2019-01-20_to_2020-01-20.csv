America’s opioid crisis steals tens of thousands of lives every year. One simple policy change would help save the lives of a group of people who are 120x more likely to die of an overdose.

Allowing states to jump-start Medicaid coverage as inmates get ready to transition out of incarceration would go to the heart of this crisis.

“We appreciate your consideration of this request and look forward to working with you and other Members of the Committee to advance common sense legislation that invests in homegrown clean energy.” https://t.co/o2PUVkJzmp,2019-04-05 20:20:56,Twitter for iPhone,2,11
“As such we would encourage @WaysMeansCmte to continue tax incentives for #cleanenergy technologies in order for the United States to remain on track to meet its commitments under the Obama Administration to the Paris Climate Accords.” https://t.co/kcbO4FlPQf,2019-04-05 20:18:31,Twitter for iPhone,1,7
“Trump Administration efforts to undermine... commonsense safeguards for new &amp; existing power plants relax fuel economy standards... curtail potent methane emissions &amp; withdraw the U.S. from #ParisAgreement fundamentally altered the framework [of] the 2015 agreement.” https://t.co/XGgfqtGymf,2019-04-05 20:11:06,Twitter for iPhone,1,5
”For many of us who served in 2015 when [the last] bipartisan bicameral agreement was reached the facts on the ground have changed. The latest extension [was] a bridge to... EPA’s Clean Power Plan among other... policies to reduce carbon emissions. This is no longer the case.” https://t.co/aj7jdOIeK6,2019-04-05 20:00:25,Twitter for iPhone,1,5

“In the United States the costs of natural disasters associated with #climatechange are on the rise... 2017 was the costliest year on record for natural disasters. Hurricanes droughts &amp; wildfires all exacerbated by climate change cost the U.S. economy at least $300 billion.” https://t.co/qq7qCkz7yN,2019-04-05 19:19:15,Twitter for iPhone,1,3
“Similarly the Trump Administration’s National Climate Assessment estimates that #climatechange could slash up to 10 percent of gross domestic product by the end of the century more than double the losses of the Great Recession a decade ago.” https://t.co/3wplGujRg5,2019-04-05 19:15:01,Twitter for iPhone,1,4
“An infrastructure package also marks an important opportunity to #ActOnClimate. A growing body of scientific evidence confirms this...

President Trump's clean air chief was a lawyer for a shady coal industry group right before &amp; continues to meet w/ industry lobbyists over objections of ethics officials.   He says that's ethical as long as there are at least five people at any meeting. 🧐 https://t.co/sY6ATWGHBQ,2019-02-25 23:53:54,Twitter for iPhone,2,3

U.S. military leaders and our intelligence community keep telling us that climate change and its consequences are a major national security threat.

Critical forecasting happens at our @NWSAlbany office.

.@realDonaldTrump failed to convince Mexico the American people or Congress to pay for his massive misguided border wall. Now he's working feverishly to undermine the rule of law that has long protected our American republic.   I'm signing on to end this #FakeEmergency now.,2019-02-15 19:32:20,TweetDeck,8,29
This president is declaring an emergency over a crisis that doesn’t exist even saying today that he ‘didn’t need to do this’.   Meanwhile illegal border crossings continue their long downward trend from already historic lows. https://t.co/YbPWXywqMz #FakeTrumpEmergency,2019-02-15 19:25:49,TweetDeck,7,24
If he chooses to continue this foolishness it would only prove that given the chance to listen to the people and govern with reason and common sense this President prefers to run head-first into his own wall.,2019-02-15 02:56:29,TweetDeck,2,22
Whatever he chooses to do from here Congress and the American people have been absolutely clear with the President that he is alone in this misguided quest to build a vast &amp; ineffective border wall.,2019-02-15 02:55:50,TweetDeck,2,13
I'm dubious about some of this agreement but that's compromise. In the end this deal funds important priorities for our national security &amp; economy resolves uncertainty for vital agencies and workers and should finally end the threat of another pointless government shutdown.,2019-02-15 02:49:56,TweetDeck,1,19

“In 2017 Congress passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

Bad enough that 2018 was the 4th hottest year on record. But #1-3 also came in the last five years.   This problem isn't going away on its own.
