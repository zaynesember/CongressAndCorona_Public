“We all know that in their hearts it is what they desired all along.”    The House Dems couldn’t hide their excitement for impeaching @realDonaldTrump when they cheered on the House floor. The American people don’t buy it. It’s a purely political sham. https://t.co/CC1SBLZHb9,2020-01-15 18:47:43,Twitter Web App,20,34
This morning Speaker Pelosi said “He’s been impeached forever. They cannot erase that.”  This has been the Democrat’s mission since Jan 20 2017. We’ve seen a politically-motived sham process that attempted to use Congress to reverse @realDonaldTrump's  election in 2016.,2020-01-15 17:44:24,Twitter Web App,43,203

#MondayMotivation: It’s been 26 days since the House voted on the “urgent” impeachment articles. @SpeakerPelosi has yet to send the articles over to the Senate.

I took to the House Floor today in opposition to the Articles of Impeachment. Madison and Hamilton warned us about this; that impeachment would veer toward political factions.  That’s exactly what this is - bitterly and nakedly partisan. https://t.co/x5QZYg1kWD,2019-12-18 22:09:52,Twitter Web App,326,1069

Hey all - here’s the DC recap for last week. Have a great week - stay warm! https://t.co/bkslrn2blW,2019-12-17 16:12:11,Twitter Web App,4,16
The Democrats on the Judiciary Committee just said that foreign-policy must be left to the “professionals.” Heaven forbid the President thinks he can be involved in foreign-policy! Do you think the “professionals” will be accountable in any election?,2019-12-12 21:13:57,Twitter for iPhone,38,114
Democrats apparently don’t understand and refuse to accept the legitimate separation of powers. They weren’t willing to go to court but they are sure willing to abuse their own power and take the law into their own hands.,2019-12-12 20:53:55,Twitter for iPhone,88,365
Democrats on the Judiciary Committee are acting as though oversight means the executive branch must bow to the legislative branch. They didn’t feel that way when a President said he would use his pen and a phone.,2019-12-12 20:53:30,Twitter for iPhone,9,18
Democrats on the Judiciary Committee are telling you that if a President doesn’t help them railroad him then he must be guilty of anything for which he’s accused. Aren’t you happy the judicial system doesn’t treat you that way?,2019-12-12 20:52:25,Twitter for iPhone,11,30
Democrats on the Judiciary Committee just admitted they can determine what evidence they choose to use to impeach the President. Agreed. Republicans just think impeachment ought to be based on High Crimes and Misdemeanors not because Dems don’t like the President.,2019-12-12 20:51:38,Twitter for iPhone,5,12
It is time for U.S. Attorney Durham to investigate if Adam Schiff was actively covering up the malfeasance outlined in the IG report of Crossfire Hurricane - explain the memo. @HouseIntel @HouseIntelComm @TheJusticeDept,2019-12-12 20:49:50,Twitter for iPhone,19,28

Mr. Holmes testified that he assumed the deputy of mission had briefed Ambassador Taylor about the call between POTUS and Ambassador Sondland.,2019-11-21 19:07:15,Twitter for iPhone,6,13
Dr. Hill testified that they (she and Tim Morrison) were concerned about how LTC Vindman would handle highly charged and partisan issues.,2019-11-21 19:06:50,Twitter for iPhone,11,16
Dr. Hill testified that she was upset that Ambassador Sonland wasn’t coordinating with her and that he wasn’t dealing with the interagency process.,2019-11-21 19:06:21,Twitter for iPhone,16,19
Dr. Hill testified that she often tried to verify Ambassador Sondland’s claims of meeting with POTUS and often found that the alleged meeting had not taken place.,2019-11-21 19:06:00,Twitter for iPhone,15,24
Mr. Holmes not Dr. Hill seem to know anything about one of the largest and most corrupt natural gas companies in Ukraine or their connections with United States officials including Vice President Biden and his son.,2019-11-21 19:05:33,Twitter for iPhone,13,26
Dr. Hill testified that she recommended Secretary Perry lead the delegation to attend the Ukrainian inaugural.,2019-11-21 18:32:23,Twitter for iPhone,7,9

Mr. Holmes did not dispute that the DNC and Hillary Clinton paid for the Steele Dossier.,2019-11-21 18:27:08,Twitter for iPhone,22,25
Mr. Holmes testified that stories regarding the Ukrainian Black Ledger were credible.,2019-11-21 18:27:07,Twitter for iPhone,4,12
At the time of the Russian invasion Obama’s inter-agency consensus was to provide Ukraine with lethal defensive aid. In disagreement with his own inter-agency President Obama never provided the defensive aid.,2019-11-21 18:27:06,Twitter for iPhone,6,12
Dr. Hill was not in favor of arming the Ukrainian military when the Russians invaded.,2019-11-21 18:20:40,Twitter for iPhone,11,12
Dr. Hill testified that interruptions in foreign aid are common.,2019-11-21 18:18:16,Twitter for iPhone,15,18
Since the Democrats are relying on quotes from Vladimir Putin to impeach the US President maybe they should add him to their list of witnesses.,2019-11-21 18:17:53,Twitter for iPhone,25,75
We are in recess so we can go vote. But no votes have actually been called. Is it too cynical to believe this break is just so Chairman Schiff can go set his narrative to the media prior to minority cross examination?,2019-11-21 16:20:32,Twitter for iPhone,552,2109
Predictably there’s going to be a press conference following Democrat questioning of the witnesses.,2019-11-21 16:05:24,Twitter for iPhone,5,11
Other participants in the very same meeting do not agree with Dr. Hill’s characterization of the tone of the meeting.,2019-11-21 16:05:11,Twitter for iPhone,10,12
Isn’t NSC official Kash Patel allowed to discuss issues with POTUS before seeking approval from Dr. Hill? He is a member of the NSC because POTUS asked him to serve there.,2019-11-21 15:57:28,Twitter for iPhone,11,25
How did Holmes know the Ukrainians were “under pressure?” Who told him that or was that just his opinion?,2019-11-21 15:55:26,Twitter for iPhone,167,425
In her own testimony Ambassador Yavonovitch stated she was aware that POTUS was looking to make a change in her position for over a year.,2019-11-21 15:55:22,Twitter for iPhone,17,47
So we believe Putin when his statements support our assertions. Otherwise he’s an untrustworthy liar. I think he’s an untrustworthy liar all the time.,2019-11-21 15:49:57,Twitter for iPhone,7,15
Goldman says the theory about CrowdStrike has been debunked. Who debunked it? When?,2019-11-21 15:47:10,Twitter for iPhone,17,35
Dr. Hill was no longer working at the White House when the call between the two presidents occurred.,2019-11-21 15:47:00,Twitter for iPhone,16,28
Mr. Holmes testified that he was seated across from Amb. Sondland at lunch during a call with POTUS where he overheard the call. Apparently however the other two people sitting right beside them at the same table didn’t report hearing any of the same call.,2019-11-21 15:45:35,Twitter for iPhone,511,1752
Schiff is discussing hypocrisy and investigations into corruption but does not mention Hunter Biden’s and Devin Archer’s involvement in Burisma during the Obama Admin. while they were also meeting regularly with White House officials while Ukraine was investigating Burisma.,2019-11-21 15:45:30,Twitter for iPhone,9,15
I agree with Dr. Hill regarding the Russian interference and their intent to have Americans fighting among themselves. The Russians actually did more in this regard after the 2016 elections.,2019-11-21 15:27:03,Twitter for iPhone,6,19
The record is full of these instances because it’s not exclusive to Russia. There is actual evidence of Ukraine’s meddling through Democrat operative Alexandra Chalupa but Chairman Schiff and Dr. Hill remain disinterested in that.,2019-11-21 15:26:44,Twitter for iPhone,8,19
No one on the committee said that Russia did not attempt to influence our elections or policy. However just because Russia does engage in this interference it doesn’t mean other countries don’t attempt to do it also.,2019-11-21 15:26:41,Twitter for iPhone,8,21
While we sincerely appreciate the perspective Mr. Holmes maintains regarding our relationship with Ukraine he is not elected and thus unaccountable for decisions regarding foreign policy. Constitutionally foreign policy is determined by the President not unelected bureaucrats.,2019-11-21 15:19:10,Twitter for iPhone,22,39
Holmes just testified that when discussing a televised interview Mr. Yermak shrugged and then he (Holmes) assigned the rationale for the shrug. How does he know why Yermak shrugged?,2019-11-21 15:17:28,Twitter for iPhone,8,8
Without any direct factual knowledge Holmes is testifying about his “impressions” of the president’s intentions about the security assistance.,2019-11-21 15:17:11,Twitter for iPhone,12,19
By his own claims Holmes is a prolific note taker yet he took no notes about the phone call.,2019-11-21 15:16:56,Twitter for iPhone,16,22
Holmes testified that during his meeting with Zelensky’s chief of staff he (the chief of staff) said that POTUS was interested in Zelensky’s personnel selection for Prosecutor General. POTUS was concerned because the person being considered had ties to a known corrupt oligarch.,2019-11-21 15:16:33,Twitter for iPhone,6,12
While President Zelensky likely did want a White House meeting with parliamentary elections looming a stated concern for having the meeting too early was viewed as potentially influencing those parliamentary elections in Zelensky’s favor and inadvisable.,2019-11-21 15:16:33,Twitter for iPhone,6,10
Newly elected Ukrainian president Zelensky had reason to believe Amb. Yovanovitch had been supportive of his rival Poroshenko.,2019-11-21 14:46:19,Twitter for iPhone,10,14
Mr. Holmes just stated that Lutsenko retracted his allegations about Amb. Yovanovitch. While that is widely reported Lutsenko denies the reporting.,2019-11-21 14:45:55,Twitter for iPhone,9,18
While honorable servants neither of these witnesses will be able to offer new or significant information relevant to the accusations. https://t.co/KJrGCi7mMv,2019-11-21 14:41:36,Twitter for iPhone,33,96
Amb. Sondland testified that “no one ever said to us back off of Ukraine we have concerns there was a bad phone call.”,2019-11-20 17:29:48,Twitter for iPhone,5,18
Amb. Sondland testified that Amb. Taylor never discussed any concerns he may have had with what has been described as an “irregular channel” that was comprised of Amb. Sondland Amb. Volker and Sec. Perry.,2019-11-20 17:29:23,Twitter for iPhone,12,19
Amb. Taylor said he got his “clear understanding” of the issue from Sondland but it doesn’t appear that Sondland has a clear understanding of the issues.,2019-11-20 17:28:43,Twitter for iPhone,12,23
Amb. Sondland never understood there to be an interest for Ukrainians to investigate US persons.,2019-11-20 17:27:40,Twitter for iPhone,9,18
Sondland hangs up the phone without even attempting to reconcile it? Instead Sondland proceeds based on his assumptions. What?,2019-11-20 17:27:17,Twitter for iPhone,2,15
Confused by his assumptions Amb. Sondland called POTUS expressly to clear up what he was assuming from conversations with Giuliani. POTUS responded directly in opposition to Sondland’s assumptions “nothing there is no quid pro quo.”,2019-11-20 17:27:15,Twitter for iPhone,14,30
If Amb. Sondland were concerned about aid being withheld per Guiliani but he didn’t have a conversation with Guiliani ‘til August how could it have impacted the conversation between POTUS and Zelensky?,2019-11-20 16:49:47,Twitter for iPhone,9,25
Amb. Sondland said he didn’t have any contact w/ Giuliani until Aug. 2019. The phone call in question occurred on July 25.,2019-11-20 16:49:45,Twitter for iPhone,17,34
Records indicate that $3M was transferred from Burisma to the business owned by Hunter Biden.,2019-11-20 16:35:59,Twitter for iPhone,22,48
President Obama’s ambassador to Ukraine called for investigations into Burisma.,2019-11-20 16:35:26,Twitter for iPhone,15,39
Sondland just testified that POTUS never spoke to him about security assistance.,2019-11-20 16:06:42,Twitter for iPhone,77,385
Since the Amb. works for POTUS why is he confused about the President’s direction?,2019-11-20 16:06:23,Twitter for iPhone,7,21
However in his deposition in the SCIF and again today Amb. Sondland testified that when he asked POTUS directly “what do you want from Ukraine?” POTUS responded “Nothing. There is no quid-pro -quo” which the President repeated.,2019-11-20 16:06:22,Twitter for iPhone,30,71
Today Amb. Sondland says there was a quid-pro-quo as he understood it based on conversations with Rudi Giuliani.,2019-11-20 16:06:20,Twitter for iPhone,7,20
Amb. Sonland just said there was a quid-pro-quo even though he never heard that from the President. Not sure why Sondland would say that since he said the EXACT OPPOSITE in his depositions in the SCIF.,2019-11-20 15:22:52,Twitter for iPhone,87,155
Sonland just testified that he requested that Pompeo set up a meeting with Zelensky and POTUS in Warsaw. Pompeo agreed but the meeting did not occur as POTUS could not attend due to Hurricane Dorian.,2019-11-20 15:17:11,Twitter for iPhone,12,30
Sonland just said that in his meeting with President Zelensky after the call with POTUS he (Zelensky) did not discuss any request to investigate VP Biden.,2019-11-20 15:08:15,Twitter for iPhone,28,44
Ambassador Sonland:   “no one shared any concerns about the call with me at the time.”,2019-11-20 15:08:05,Twitter for iPhone,7,15
Amb. Sonland just testified that while he is aware of accounts of the meeting from Dr. Hill and LTC Vindman their recollections of those events “simply don’t square with my own or with those of ambassador Volker or Secretary Perry.”,2019-11-20 15:07:54,Twitter for iPhone,4,32
Ambassador Sonland testified that “we kept leadership of the State Dept and NSC informed of our activities.”,2019-11-20 15:07:38,Twitter for iPhone,3,13
Sonland just stated that Giuliani emphasized that POTUS wanted a public statement from president Zelensky committing Ukraine to look into corruption issues.,2019-11-20 15:07:26,Twitter for iPhone,2,10
Amb. Sonland testified that President Trump expressed concerns that the Ukrainian government was not serious about reform and even mentioned that Ukraine tried to take him (POTUS) down in the last election.,2019-11-20 14:51:56,Twitter for iPhone,11,23
Although EU Ambassador Sonland is characterized as being “out of his lane” he stated that “any claim that I somehow muscled my way into the Ukrainian relationship is simply false.”,2019-11-20 14:48:26,Twitter for iPhone,6,14
Sonland said that “the suggestion that we were engaged in some irregular or rogue diplomacy is absolutely false.”,2019-11-20 14:41:48,Twitter for iPhone,7,27
Ambassador Sonland said that he did not want to work with Giuliani but did not believe his (Giuliani) role was improper.,2019-11-20 14:41:34,Twitter for iPhone,10,15
Ambassador Sonland just testified that his “memory has not been perfect.”,2019-11-20 14:41:10,Twitter for iPhone,10,23
He’s no doubt aware that standard procedure for the radical left is to destroy anyone associated with the President if they can’t destroy the President himself.,2019-11-20 14:40:55,Twitter for iPhone,11,18
Ambassador Sonland’s attorney is a perjury trap expert; so expect this witness - who has a loose command of his own memory kept no notes and speaks in generalities - to be overly concerned with his own legal jeopardy.,2019-11-20 14:40:55,Twitter for iPhone,22,39
Now that he’s leading the impeachment effort though Ukraine is suddenly a key ally for Schiff.,2019-11-20 14:20:29,Twitter for iPhone,6,32
Adam Schiff just said Ukraine is a “key ally.” He didn’t think so when Russian tanks were rolling through eastern Ukraine and Crimea. Most Republicans in Washington were stridently urging the Obama Administration  to supply more than blankets and MREs and they never did.,2019-11-20 14:20:29,Twitter for iPhone,199,830
Ambassador Volker testified that he didn’t view Rudi Giuliani as a channel at all - or a representative of the US Government.,2019-11-19 22:43:18,Twitter for iPhone,14,31

Tim Morrison testifies that there was no malicious intent in classified storage of the transcription of the call.,2019-11-19 22:35:16,Twitter for iPhone,5,8
Tim Morrison recommended that access to the transcript be restricted because he was concerned it would be leaked.,2019-11-19 22:33:02,Twitter for iPhone,2,2

I took to the House floor to condemn FGM and call for international efforts to stop the horrific practice worldwide. FGM is an unconscionable systematic form of abuse and subjugation perpetuated against the youngest and most vulnerable among us. #EndFGM https://t.co/BwHY1HkbxX https://t.co/jnicvC3jf2,2019-02-06 21:05:07,Twitter Web Client,7,21

We must strengthen our efforts to stop this practice; it must end immediately &amp; those who perpetrate it must be brought to swift justice in the US. I ask the 22 States that currently have no law banning FGM -including my home state of PA- to pass legislation immediately. #EndFGM,2019-02-06 17:30:00,TweetDeck,7,22

FGM made headlines in the US. Drs. Fakhruddin Attar and Jumana Nagarwala are accused of performing FGM on at least 9 underage girls from 8 to 13 years old. Most charges were dropped when the US federal ban was ruled unconstitutional. https://t.co/lXGL6IVLnj #EndFGM,2019-02-06 16:30:00,TweetDeck,7,9
FGM is primarily concentrated in 30 countries in Africa the Middle East and Asia – most common in Somalia Guinea and Djibouti where more than 90% of women and girls ages 15 to 49 are mutilated on a routine basis. #EndFGM,2019-02-06 16:00:01,TweetDeck,5,5
FGM comprises all procedures that involve partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons. The @WHO says there are no medical benefits. The trauma lasts a lifetime. #EndFGM,2019-02-06 15:30:00,TweetDeck,2,4
FGM is a deeply rooted cultural practice impacting more than 200 million girls worldwide. In 25 countries where it’s practiced an estimated 68 million girls will be cut in the next 12 years. It’s most commonly performed on girls from infancy to age 15. #EndFGM,2019-02-06 15:00:00,TweetDeck,2,7
