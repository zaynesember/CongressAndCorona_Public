No one benefits from families being torn apart and no one should profit from it. This cruel policy is not who we are as a country. #ChildrenNotCriminals https://t.co/3mzW1C5u0E,2019-02-21 02:22:22,Twitter for iPhone,116,284
The Homestead facility makes $1.2M a day off of detained children. Profits incentivize incarcerating and detaining people. Last year I pledged to not accept #privateprison money &amp; today it could not have been more clear why that was the right choice.  https://t.co/pBhNzOm7FT,2019-02-20 00:03:46,Twitter for iPhone,15,30
Since 2016 @GEOGroup and @CoreCivic have spent more than $2.6M on federal lobbying. In 2018 a record 51379 detainees were held and at the beginning of this year it was announced that the nation’s first detention center for migrant children (housed in #FL26) will be expanding.,2019-02-20 00:03:46,Twitter for iPhone,9,23
The reason behind @realDonaldTrump’s cruel policy becomes clear when you #followthemoney. Two of the #privateprison companies that profit the most from it (@GEOGroup @CoreCivic) contributed $200k+ to pro-Trump committees in 2016.  #ChildrenNotCriminals  https://t.co/GZzDd7wp89,2019-02-20 00:03:46,Twitter for iPhone,27,30
Tearing children from the arms of their parents without regard for where they will end up is NOT who we are as a nation. People across the country are paying attention to how President Trump’s immigration policies are hurting our communities. #ChildrenNotCriminals,2019-02-20 00:03:45,Twitter for iPhone,4,12
Today I saw first hand what life is like for migrant children who are being detained in #privateprisons. What I witnessed was a shameless profit scheme and a cruel policy that has to stop. #ChildrenNotCriminals,2019-02-20 00:03:42,Twitter for iPhone,28,58
Today I will be leading a group to the @HHSGov  Homestead Detention Center to find out exactly what is happening at those centers and see how we can help! You can follow along on my official Twitter: @RepDMP. #ChildrenNotCriminals,2019-02-19 14:22:27,Twitter for iPhone,14,54
The country’s first for-profit child detention center is operating in Homestead FL with little or no oversight. Children ages 13-17 are held at this center for an average of 67 days. #FL26 #ChildrenNotCriminals https://t.co/2Rlpkjcvp3,2019-02-19 14:18:20,Twitter for iPhone,40,46

The President failed to mention expanding TPS to include Venezuelans. Trump has the power to provide immediate relief to the Venezuelan people instead of deporting them back to a country where they do not have access to basic necessities. #VenezuelaLibre,2019-02-19 02:35:40,Twitter for iPhone,98,226
