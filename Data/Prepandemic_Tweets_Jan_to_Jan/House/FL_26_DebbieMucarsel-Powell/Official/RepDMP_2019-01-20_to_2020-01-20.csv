We’re tired of these empty words. #VenezuelaSOS,2019-10-04 21:13:04,Twitter for iPhone,7,16
Since then @SenRickScott blocked the bill in the Senate introduced an anti-immigrant amendment to try to mislead the American people and @senatemajldr has refused to hold a vote on #VenezuelaTPS.,2019-10-04 21:13:04,Twitter for iPhone,6,22

Richard from Miami asked why is the Admin not complying with congressional subpoenas … that is a GOOD question! That’s a question for Trump but they are keeping the American people in the dark and undermining our Constitution. #AskDMP,2019-09-20 21:03:50,Twitter Web App,0,2

Roberto from Miami asked if will vote to ratify the USMCA. I will closely study whatever deal is presented to us. I wrote to Trump to tell him any deal must address our country’s climate crisis.

Alex from Miami asked if I would support HR2186 known as El Chapo Act. The El Chapo Act was introduced in the 115th Congress and it hasn’t been introduced this Congress. Regardless I don’t support funding Trump’s vanity ineffective border wall. #AskDMP,2019-09-20 21:03:50,Twitter Web App,0,0

If you or someone you know is struggling call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (1-800-273-8255) for free and confidential support.   https://t.co/4wy6crf37y,2019-09-11 01:26:38,Twitter for iPhone,6,11
💛You are loved 💛You matter 💛You are not alone  20 veterans servicemembers reservists &amp; members of the National Guard die by suicide a day. This is a public health crisis.    On #WorldSuicidePreventionDay know that it is okay to get help.,2019-09-11 01:26:38,Twitter for iPhone,15,43
It’s 7:17 pm my Rep. colleagues give amendment after amendment to delay and obstruct. We haven’t even voted on the FIRST #GunSafety bill the #ERPO Act.  When asked by one of my Democratic colleagues if they’d vote on the bill if we adopted a suggested amendment the answer was NO https://t.co/nErx4YYPX8,2019-09-10 23:22:23,Twitter for iPhone,36,56
195 days ago we passed #HR8 to require #UniversalBackgroundChecks for all firearm purchases—a policy over 90% of Americans support. @SenateGOP has done nothing with #HR8 while countless Americans die from gun violence. It’s time we hold the Senate accountable! #DoSomething https://t.co/akg0FhoaXq,2019-09-10 21:36:16,Twitter for iPhone,3,9
This is not acceptable. Our veterans sacrificed when they answered the call to serve and we cannot fail them. #ProtectOurCare,2019-09-10 20:09:04,Twitter Web App,1,6
Unfortunately this story is all too common. It has become such a challenge that Monroe County’s Director of Veterans Affairs will often volunteer hours from her day to drive veterans to Miami’s VA so they can access necessary health services.,2019-09-10 20:09:03,Twitter Web App,1,4
Because of this short turnaround she was unable to travel to Miami for her appointment. She was told to go through the Community Care Network for her treatment more locally but because the Keys does not have any approved providers she had to forgo the care she needed.,2019-09-10 20:09:03,Twitter Web App,0,0
My office recently heard from a constituent who had moved to the Keys and requires monthly treatments that can only be provided by a full-service VA. She had difficulty making an appointment with the Miami VA and wasn’t informed of a confirmed appointment until the day before.,2019-09-10 20:09:03,Twitter Web App,1,1
They have to travel long distances for care often do not receive confirmation for appointments until the night before and as a result can miss appointments when they are unable to secure transportation on such short notice.,2019-09-10 20:09:03,Twitter Web App,0,0
My constituents were originally covered through Health Net and when they left Tri West temporarily took over and now they’re handing over to Optum. During these handoffs our veterans’ health care needs have been abandoned.,2019-09-10 20:09:02,Twitter Web App,0,0
Furthermore veterans in my district have been subject to the continuous disruption in service from the handoffs between the VA’s private partners: Health Net Tri West and Optum.,2019-09-10 20:09:02,Twitter Web App,0,0
This program was supposed to be operational by June 6 of this year. Unfortunately in Monroe County the providers in the local Community Care network have yet to be approved so my constituents remain in limbo.,2019-09-10 20:09:02,Twitter Web App,0,0
Although there is a VA clinic in Key West it only provides basic care and often refers patients to the facility in Miami for most services. As such many of our veterans have to travel for hours from their homes in the Keys to receive the care that they need.,2019-09-10 20:09:02,Twitter Web App,0,0
Under the #MISSIONAct any veteran living at least 40 miles away from a full-service VA is eligible to receive health care from community health providers that are in the approved Community Care network.,2019-09-10 20:09:01,Twitter Web App,0,0
@VetAffairsDems This was supposed to have been addressed when the #VAChoiceProgram was established in 2014 and access to care in rural areas was supposed to be improved when Congress passed the #VAMISSIONAct in 2018 with the creation of the Veterans Community Care Program.,2019-09-10 20:09:01,Twitter Web App,0,1
For years veterans in #MonroeCounty have struggled w/ access to care. Former servicemembers living in the #FloridaKeys often have to travel over 100 miles to the Miami VA to have access to the full set of care they need. @VetAffairsDems (Thread) https://t.co/5N9UJLf1NQ,2019-09-10 20:05:31,Twitter Media Studio,8,13
400 yrs ago the 1st slaves arrived in Virginia starting a dark chapter in America. #400YearsLater we commemorate the brutal history of slavery and racism.   May we keep remembering the horrors of slavery and continue to address injustices we see everyday in our communities. https://t.co/i5s6uTFrWG,2019-09-10 19:43:55,Twitter for iPhone,5,19
This stack of Republican delay tactics won’t stop us from passing commonsense gun safety!  We were here for 12 hrs when we passed #UniversalBackgroundChecks. I’m willing to stay as long as necessary to pass legislation to make our communities safer! #DisarmHate @HouseJudiciary https://t.co/8A5DnSaFLs,2019-09-10 18:46:00,Twitter for iPhone,68,183
Americans from all over the country are demanding Congress take action.

The sheer devastation in the Bahamas after #HurricaneDorian requires us to welcome our neighbors who are in dire need. But the Admin is putting out conflicting info as Bahamians try to find safety in the US. I’m getting answers and will share any info I have. #BahamasStrong https://t.co/eBic7uPt5i,2019-09-10 13:46:57,Twitter for iPhone,13,28

In my first 200+ days in office it’s been incredible seeing the small accomplishments make a huge difference in Miami Dade &amp; Monroe like FEMA reimbursements &amp; critical research grants..&amp; we’ve passed over 200 bills! Proud to be working every day #ForThePeople. @CBSMiami @DeFede https://t.co/LcRtnG5Ai9,2019-09-09 23:09:21,Twitter Media Studio,6,16
Yes @RepDean Well said! WHAT are they afraid of?? The American people want us to save lives make our communities safer! We’re ready to ACT. #DoSomething https://t.co/5oo1C2U3nF,2019-09-09 20:01:55,Twitter for iPhone,19,45
As Bahamians work to recover after #HurricaneDorian South Floridians are right there with them helping rebuild. Thank you to @MiamiDadeFire @CityOfMiamiFire and families across #FL26 who are putting their lives on hold to help our neighbors in the Bahamas. #BahamasStrong https://t.co/6juKtfJ8Fi,2019-09-09 19:16:16,Twitter for iPhone,1,3
The American people have spoken they are demanding action to #EndGunViolence. Over 90% of Americans support universal background checks. It is negligent of @senatemajldr and @SenateGOP to just sit idly by as we see these mass shootings. #DoSomething @CNN @NewDay https://t.co/iM1UarUr0p,2019-09-09 16:17:21,Twitter Media Studio,26,74

It’s been a very traumatic week for not only our brothers and sisters in the Bahamas but for all those who reside here in South Florida who have yet to hear from some of their family members who have been struck by this monster hurricane.

I would like thank everyone who has been donating to the Bahamas.   It’s important to make sure you are donating to accredited organizations.   For more information on how to help please visit: https://t.co/PN64lpmU2b #BahamasStrong,2019-09-08 20:47:10,Twitter for iPhone,9,22
It’s absurd that a hand full of Republican Senators are the only thing standing in the way of universal background checks which over 90% of Americans support. I sat down with @DeFede to discuss how I’m taking action to make gun safety a reality. #EndGunViolence @CBSMiami https://t.co/vJomjDkQ2N,2019-09-08 15:25:57,Twitter for iPhone,12,29
My children here in #Florida have gone through multiple active shooter drills. Our children and our communities deserve to live in a country where we put safety first.

Today marks 192 days since the House passed a bipartisan bill for universal background checks. It’s past time the Senate pass this commonsense legislation too! #DoSomething https://t.co/EYxikXEwv4,2019-09-07 21:14:29,Twitter for iPhone,3,15
