Mitch Trump &amp; the rest of the GOP are betting that the pathetic @NRA is more powerful than the American people. They will do nothing to protect Americans from #GunViolence but everything to keep the blood $ flowing. We have to prove them wrong. Vote. Them. Out. #EnoughIsEnough https://t.co/Nbd6GiXO6v,2019-09-01 16:35:55,Twitter for iPhone,8,13
