As US Atty for Southern FL @SecretaryAcosta let #Epstein off with a sweetheart deal.

This must be the @senatemajldr's idea of an #AprilFools joke.    Reality check: what he did to #MerrickGarland wasn't funny. https://t.co/NDwueEHcpm,2019-04-01 22:00:36,Twitter Web Client,75,214
.@BetsyDeVosED keeps telling us who she is and we need to believe her. She is unfit to look after the well-being of our education system and our children. It's time for her to go. #ResignDeVos https://t.co/vJVGckGUK8,2019-04-01 20:58:19,Twitter Web Client,50,118
The #GOP has only ever had one plan: sabotage the health care system tens of millions of Americans rely on.   But good news @HouseDemocrats are just as unwavering: we remain committed to ensuring everyone has access to quality affordable care. #forthepeople #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/2n9SxEZPku,2019-04-01 19:33:05,Twitter Web Client,13,35
Everyone is entitled to equal access to public education and @BetsyDeVosED has fundamentally failed to stick up for children. She is unfit to carry on in this job. She must resign as the Secretary of Education. #FireDeVos  https://t.co/u232NtAwhX,2019-04-01 14:18:12,Twitter Web Client,40,80
It is @BetsyDeVosED's job to ensure all our students are treated fairly. She has failed at this responsibility. It's time for her to go. @NewDay https://t.co/fj8KoWF4f8,2019-04-01 13:52:39,Twitter Web Client,162,826
When you push forward policies that advocate for discrimination and that hurt kids and families you're showing your true colors. This White House has showed us who they are and we have to believe them. https://t.co/VJkGpgWM9b,2019-04-01 12:39:40,Twitter Web Client,52,174
I'm calling on @BetsyDeVosED to resign. She has failed to protect our student. She revoked a policy to address racial discrimination in school discipline practices and then cherry-picked racist research to back it up. She needs to reinstate this policy and apologize or go. https://t.co/u7ewDeCsdw,2019-04-01 12:32:45,Twitter Web Client,972,2713
Good morning--Tune in NOW as I talk @BetsyDeVosED and her threats to civil rights equality and our students. It's time for us to call it like it is and demand more from the Secretary of @usedgov. @Morning_Joe https://t.co/AnZJDxIRi7,2019-04-01 12:26:33,Twitter Web Client,57,141
The Mueller Report is 300 pages. All we've seen is a 4-page opinion piece by AG Barr.      It's time for Congress and the American people to see the facts for ourselves. #ReleaseTheReport,2019-03-29 18:04:32,Twitter Web Client,40,133
Proud to stand with you @RepAdamSchiff. We are lucky to have your thoughtful and patriotic leadership. Thank you for all your work on behalf the @housedemocrats and our country. #IStandWithAdamSchiff,2019-03-29 12:14:40,Twitter for iPhone,51,271
.@BetsyDeVosED wanted to enact a racist policy and cherry-picked racist research to back it up. Just because we have come to expect this from the Trump administration doesn’t mean we should accept it.  https://t.co/AZdmoPpXlr,2019-03-28 21:55:40,Twitter Web Client,305,847
Today @HouseDemocrats voted to reject the President's latest attack on the #LGBTQ community the #TransMilitaryban. Our doors are open to all and closed to policies of hate and bigotry. #ProtectTransTroops https://t.co/k67UqRab6x https://t.co/YJtksTdsxE,2019-03-28 15:39:45,Twitter Web Client,53,231

@rosadelauro Congrats Congresswoman! This is a great day for equality and our country! #EqualPayForEqualWork,2019-03-27 22:35:43,Twitter Web Client,1,18
In 2013 I campaigned on improving economic opportunities for women &amp; families. As a freshman the #PaycheckFairnessAct was the first bill I cosponsored. I'm incredibly proud to see this moment come to life so we can finally honor the vital role that women play in our economy. https://t.co/xX4qt19I9T,2019-03-27 22:34:42,Twitter Web Client,14,76
A woman who works full-time year-round typically loses $406760 over a 40-yr career because of the gender pay gap... Yes still in 2019.  But not for long. Today @HouseDemocrats will pass the #PaycheckFairness Act. Because equal work deserves equal pay. #WomensHistoryMonth https://t.co/AOso63JPH1,2019-03-27 18:33:05,Twitter Web Client,47,75
On our first day in the majority @HouseDemocrats voted to protect people with #PreExistingConditions from the #GOP's repeated attacks.   Well their attacks haven't stopped and our fight #forthepeople won't stop either. https://t.co/CTnNa5IHjw,2019-03-27 16:38:57,Twitter Web Client,12,20
