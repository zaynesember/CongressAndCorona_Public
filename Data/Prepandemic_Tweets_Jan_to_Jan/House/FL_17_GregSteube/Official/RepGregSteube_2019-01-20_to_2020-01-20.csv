Democratic leaders claim to renounce anti-Semitism and say it has no place in the House but they clearly think it has a place on the Foreign Affairs Committee. Actions speak louder than words…,2019-03-15 20:05:00,TweetDeck,3,9
When will enough be enough? Rep. Omar has consistently spewed anti-Semitic hate speech and House Democrats have done nothing about it.,2019-03-15 16:45:00,TweetDeck,3,16
Last week I voted no on a watered-down resolution that failed to condemn the anti-Semitic remarks made by Rep. Omar. This week I’m taking action by introducing a new resolution that enumerates her offenses and condemns her behavior. https://t.co/KWQ3N1FPxs,2019-03-15 13:45:00,TweetDeck,11,18

Rep. Omar has repeatedly made anti-Semitic remarks but has yet to face any real punishment from her caucus. If Democrat leadership wants to stand against such rhetoric they’d remove her from the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Don’t you agree?,2019-03-14 20:57:00,TweetDeck,8,42
How many vile anti-Semitic tropes will it take for House Democrats to condemn Rep. Omar by name and remove her from the Foreign Affairs Committee?,2019-03-14 19:45:00,TweetDeck,1,10

Under H.R. 1 taxpayer dollars will be going to support entrenched politicians and political consultants who we don’t agree with or want to support.,2019-03-08 15:50:00,TweetDeck,2,2
Our tax dollars should go to funding our military and protecting American citizens not to promoting politicians we don’t even agree with. That’s why I’m voting no on H.R. 1.,2019-03-08 15:45:00,TweetDeck,1,6
H.R. 1 takes power away from voters and puts it in the hands of convicted criminals. The bill would strip voters of their 14th Amendment rights to limit the vote to people who haven’t been convicted of murder violent felonies or other serious crimes.,2019-03-08 15:40:00,TweetDeck,1,3
H.R. 1 is a slap in the face to our democratic system. This bill attacks the rights of the states and puts our election security at risk.,2019-03-08 15:35:00,TweetDeck,0,2
Under H.R. 1 there would be no checks and balances to prevent voter fraud and no penalties for ineligible individuals voting in error.,2019-03-08 15:30:00,TweetDeck,0,1
Same-day voter registration is a threat to our democratic process. When voters are allowed to register on the same day there is very little room to confirm identity and ensure they are voting in the correct election.,2019-03-08 15:25:00,TweetDeck,0,13
Every day personal data is at risk online. With H.R. 1 the democrats would add to this threat by requiring states to maintain online voter registration with no safeguards.,2019-03-08 15:20:00,TweetDeck,0,1
H.R. 1 would require that all states adopt an automatic voter registration system that would rely on the federal government for records. This could lead to thousands of registration errors and the registration of ineligible voters.,2019-03-08 15:15:00,TweetDeck,0,10
Don’t be fooled—H.R. 1 is legislation that has been designed to fund elect and maintain the Democratic majority all while ignoring states’ rights and wasting taxpayer dollars.,2019-03-08 15:06:41,Twitter Web Client,1,10

No question about it #MichaelCohen is a liar. It’s embarrassing that @HouseDemocrats had us sit through this circus. Meanwhile @realDonaldTrump is in Vietnam addressing real issues. https://t.co/65xtpF1qCx,2019-02-27 23:33:58,Twitter for iPhone,137,300
Our Second Amendment rights are at stake. @HouseDemocrats want to rob us of our constitutionally guaranteed protections in the name of violence prevention all while doing nothing to actually prevent violence.,2019-02-27 21:15:00,TweetDeck,18,35
As written now the current House gun control proposal would have done nothing to prevent many of the tragedies with firearms we’ve witnessed in recent years. #Support2A,2019-02-27 20:45:00,TweetDeck,235,1071
Requiring additional background checks does nothing if the check isn’t run against a complete database—let’s focus on implementation of current laws like #FixNICS before creating new ones. #Support2A,2019-02-27 20:15:00,TweetDeck,4,19
The current gun control legislation before the House will criminalize the private transfer of firearms including to some family members prohibiting Americans from exercising their right to self-defense. #Support2A,2019-02-27 19:45:00,TweetDeck,7,23
Hey @HouseDemocrats—how about instead of creating new laws we better apply the ones we already have on the books? What’s the value of a background check without quality and accurate data in the system? #FixNICS #Support2A,2019-02-27 19:15:00,TweetDeck,18,62
(2/2) 1. Require failed background checks to be reported to law enforcement. 2. Require illegal immigrants be reported to ICE if they attempted to purchase a firearm. #Support2A https://t.co/mbKCqMXBL6,2019-02-27 19:13:32,Twitter Web Client,11,36
(1/2) Just got off the House Floor discussing the Democrats’ gun control legislation H.R. 8. This bill is nothing more than a political stunt. If Democrats cared about solving problems they would have supported my amendment that would do two things: https://t.co/wWEbL58nZf,2019-02-27 19:11:26,Twitter Web Client,15,43
Don’t be fooled: House Dems claim their gun control bill is a solution to gun violence but it does nothing to solve real problems like our nation’s mental health crisis. #Support2A,2019-02-27 18:45:00,TweetDeck,5,23
Democrats don't want to stop gun violence they want to infringe on the constitutionally guaranteed Second Amendment rights of law-abiding American citizens. We must stop H.R. 8! #Support2A,2019-02-27 17:59:01,Twitter Web Client,11,22
H.R. 8 will criminalize the private transfer of firearms and will make exercising basic constitutional rights impossibly expensive for millions of law-abiding Americans. #Support2A,2019-02-27 17:56:27,Twitter Web Client,246,827
