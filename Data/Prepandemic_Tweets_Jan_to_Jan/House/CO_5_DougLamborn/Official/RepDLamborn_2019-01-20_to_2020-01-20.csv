#USMCA is a major win for the American people. It is currently headed to @realDonaldTrump's desk where it will be signed into law. The USMCA will create 176000 jobs and lead to higher growth and rising wages. This is yet another example of #PromisesKept.,2020-01-17 00:28:39,Twitter for iPhone,17,54

Pelosi just pulled a Schiff. On the House Floor she blatantly misquoted the call between @POTUS &amp; Zelensky. @realDonaldTrump never said "do me a favor."

Today I wrote a letter demanding the release of ALL of the evidence from this "impeachment inquiry" not just cherry-picked documents leaked to create a phony narrative by Schiff. Last week we were promised transparency I'm still waiting to see it.  What are Dems afraid of? https://t.co/En2B1Osxo1,2019-11-04 22:38:34,Twitter Web App,118,359

The fact that Dems are only releasing transcripts that benefit their narrative shows this process is a sham. Schiff's soviet-style secret "investigation" cannot continue; the people deserve access to all of the docs. This a total partisan hit-job to get @realDonaldTrump.,2019-11-04 17:28:23,Twitter Web App,60,319

The most ironic part of this entire sham is the fact that the only bipartisan vote yesterday was AGAINST impeachment. Dems have been trying since 2016 to remove @realDonaldTrump from office. They have let impeachment replace their entire legislative agenda. #DoNothingDemocrats,2019-11-01 21:29:10,Twitter Web App,244,762

We have 20 legislative days to fully fund our military. Without this crucial funding we jeopardize our ongoing operations as well as the R&amp;D for next-generation weapons.

Why is @INTELCmte in charge of an investigation not related to intelligence? Why is a SCIF certified for intelligence oversight being used for unclassified interviews? Dems are leading a nefarious process against @realDonaldTrump &amp; are trying to hide the FACTS from the people.,2019-10-24 16:19:28,Twitter Web App,37,133
In a letter I exercised my right to review committee testimonies. Schiff has spent 2 years creating a false narrative about @realDonaldTrump &amp; has lied to the American people.

Rep Schiff frequently pops in &amp; out of his secret room in the bowels of the Capitol to spread lies about @realDonaldTrump to the Democratic comms team at CNN.

Medicare for All would force 70% of Americans off of their private plans to compete for care in an inefficient public system. That means longer wait times higher taxes and an overall reduction in quality care especially for the most vulnerable populations.,2019-04-30 19:37:44,Twitter Web Client,2,8
Medicare for All takes away people's choice for health care. In fact over 150 million Americans would lose their employer-sponsored coverage under the Democrats' #MedicareForAll Act. Here are the numbers for Colorado... https://t.co/YTN0z3RaK6,2019-04-30 17:31:00,Twitter Web Client,30,48
