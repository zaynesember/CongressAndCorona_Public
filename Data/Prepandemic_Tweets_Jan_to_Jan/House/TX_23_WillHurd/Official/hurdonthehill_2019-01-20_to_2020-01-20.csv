We know there are at least 30000 ISIS fighters in the region and we know the leader of ISIS is still around. Unfortunately this ceasefire is looking more like a surrender than a peace deal. Our enemies like Russia Iran and Turkey are playing chess while we're playing checkers. https://t.co/JzhXihwLyz,2019-10-20 23:45:00,Twitter Media Studio,3739,8754
On my way to be the grand marshal of the 59th annual #Amistad festivities today in #DelRio. At a time when our friends aren’t trusting us and our enemies aren’t fearing us traditions like the #Abrazo ceremony are so important. https://t.co/tM3HkImd1k,2019-10-19 14:13:05,Twitter for iPhone,27,319
When walking down the National Mall patriotism should overwhelm every American's spirit. But for nearly 60 million Americans there is a void.

Nature isn't just a destination it's our home. We should be protecting our parks and public lands not just because they're natural wonders but also because conservation is vital to addressing climate change.

Discrimination based on age race or gender has no place in today’s workplace. Proud to help introduce this bipartisan bill so all of our nation’s workers can continue to support their families and help our businesses and economy thrive. https://t.co/ZWbsWWNqXE,2019-02-14 22:27:59,TweetDeck,17,120
I stand with @USAmbIndia and @rashtrapatibhvn in condemning the horrible #KashmirTerrorAttack on CRPF personnel. I spent part of my CIA career in India working to stop terrorist organizations and will continue to do so in Congress in solidarity with our allies across the globe.,2019-02-14 16:25:35,TweetDeck,348,1034
Pulling out of NAFTA to force an affirmative vote on USMCA would be counterproductive to efforts to approve the new agreement. Working with Congress is a more viable path to success than trying to hold NAFTA hostage.   https://t.co/jm35q9zEwc,2019-02-14 14:39:50,TweetDeck,17,130

My heart is with the loved ones of Rep. Walter Jones a dedicated public servant who represented the good people of North Carolina with faith and integrity for over two decades. I was lucky to be able to call him not just a colleague but a friend. He will be missed in Congress.,2019-02-11 02:14:30,Twitter for iPhone,19,174
I left an organization I love and a career I loved because  I believed I could help the intelligence community in a different way — as a policy maker. That's one of the reasons I ran for Congress. https://t.co/49xkKTbqbd,2019-02-09 20:00:00,TweetDeck,32,291
It's imperative for our national security that the intelligence community has the workforce infrastructure &amp; resources they need to keep Americans safe in the 21st century. I look forward to further supporting our intelligence agencies with this new role. https://t.co/eknqIBRlkL,2019-02-08 19:23:35,TweetDeck,21,239
It's my job as Representative to create policies that foster innovation entrepreneurship and job growth rather than stifle it. Our hardworking #smallbiz owners deserve nothing less. Thank you @NAWBONational! I'll continue to advocate for Texas's 890k+ #womenbusinessowners. https://t.co/sLs75choDW,2019-02-05 20:55:00,Twitter Media Studio,22,170
