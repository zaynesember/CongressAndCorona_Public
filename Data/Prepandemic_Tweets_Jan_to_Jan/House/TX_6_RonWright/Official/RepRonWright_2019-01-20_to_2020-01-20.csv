How can House Democrats come back and say that impeaching @realDonaldTrump is an "urgent" matter when the Articles collected dust on Speaker Pelosi's desk for 4 weeks?

Condemning a regime that continues to murder and suppress its own people should not be a partisan issue.

When a foreign national arrives at the border without appropriate paperwork they are an undocumented immigrant.
