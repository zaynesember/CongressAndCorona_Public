One year ago today 11 lives were stolen in the Tree of Life synagogue. May we reflect on their lives. May their memories be a blessing.  Hate has no place in our neighborhoods.

BREAKING: We are officially @PPact endorsed for 2020!

On the campaign trail I promised to work hard for folks in #PA07 who work harder everyday to support their families and their communities.

I’m proud to have their endorsement and will never give up the fight in Congress to protect the environment and fight the devastating effects of climate change - that’s why I’m a co-chair of the @NewDemCoalition’s Climate Change Task Force and proudly voted for #ClimateActionNow,2019-06-06 16:56:28,Twitter for iPhone,0,9

I owe a big thank you to my Pennsylvania colleague from across the aisle @GT_TeamGT for leading this effort with me. With the passage of #StrongerCAPTA and pieces of the SPEAK UP Act we can move toward our shared goal of protecting Pennsylvania's children.,2019-05-22 01:32:23,Twitter for iPhone,0,15
Yesterday the House passed parts of my bill the SPEAK UP Act to improve the reporting process for cases of child abuse and neglect.

Polls are open across the #LehighValley! If you are a registered Democrat or Republican go out &amp; #BeAVoter for the primary candidates you want to see in the general election.

Last night the House voted to keep our promise to lower the cost of prescription drugs &amp; shore up the ACA to lower healthcare costs &amp; protect people with pre-existing conditions. You sent me here to #ProtectOurCare &amp; I’ll keep fighting to do just that.   https://t.co/iN6a8w2RXc,2019-05-17 13:19:47,Twitter for iPhone,7,12

That's why I'm using my seat at the @EdLaborCmte table to ensure we are working to make college more affordable and inclusive to begin with - and am cosponsoring several bills to help people already saddled with student loan debt including:,2019-05-07 17:46:53,Twitter for iPhone,0,6
I was home for two weeks meeting with constituents all over #PA07 &amp; one thing I heard over &amp; over again: Student Loan Debt is Holding Young People Back. It's preventing them from pursuing further education buying homes saving money. And it's a crisis.,2019-05-07 17:46:53,Twitter for iPhone,1,11
This is exactly what I - and the new Dem majority - was elected to fight. We will not allow the ACA to be dismantled and will fight tooth and nail to bring down the cost of healthcare and protect people with pre-existing conditions.,2019-05-03 15:30:24,Twitter for iPhone,1,11
The ACA made healthcare affordable to millions of Americans for the 1st time offered historic protections for millions w/ pre-existing conditions &amp; affirmed the belief that healthcare is a right not a privilege for only those who can afford it. https://t.co/cvDlzgaP7O,2019-05-03 15:30:23,Twitter for iPhone,3,13

If any state can relate it's PA where - until redistricting - gerrymandered districts looked more like cartoon characters than Congressional districts.

“I don’t take it personally but I worry about a lot of younger women my daughter and others and I don’t want to see them exposed to that.”  This is why the #PaycheckFairnessAct is so important. People in power still underestimate women and we must keep fighting for #EqualPay. https://t.co/VzDO21CvcO,2019-03-31 23:23:47,Twitter for iPhone,1,16
Families are paying astronomical rates &amp; at risk of losing their coverage - this is unacceptable.   I promised #PA07 that protecting people w/ pre-existing conditions &amp; lowering health care costs would be my number one priority. I’ll keep that promise.   https://t.co/uw3AEmH6dI,2019-03-29 17:33:37,Twitter for iPhone,4,9
I welcome this ruling to protect Americans from junk plans - the ACA put these protections in place to keep employers from getting away with providing these cheap bare bones plans because they don’t cover some of the most basic care like maternity care and prescription drugs. https://t.co/Z2PFVdBdxI,2019-03-29 13:58:08,Twitter for iPhone,2,10
After practicing law for 30+ years this wasn’t the 1st time someone tried to avoid an argument over the merits of the law by trying to dismiss me. Fortunately this amendment to undermine the #PaycheckFairnessAct didn’t pass  but we did pass #EqualPay.  https://t.co/zt2CQJmjXc,2019-03-28 21:46:56,Twitter for iPhone,9,25

Important note by @PennCapitalStar in this piece: "....Women hold only a 1/4 of the state’s legislative seats &amp; no statewide offices. PA has never elected a woman to the U.S. Senate &amp; women of color &amp; R women are especially underrepresented.",2019-03-03 19:50:22,Twitter for iPhone,1,4

I don't take corporate PAC money because I want the people of #PA07 to know that I am on their side - that I can't be swayed by big donations from corporations looking out for their profit margins. I am answering only to people looking out for the well-being of their families.,2019-02-20 16:52:38,Twitter for iPhone,6,43

Improving the lives of working families starts with creating an economy that works for everyone - not just those at the top. That means raising the minimum wage closing the #paygap and protecting our unions.   To #PA07 I promise I’m working on all of the above.,2019-02-13 19:42:44,Twitter for iPhone,6,21
