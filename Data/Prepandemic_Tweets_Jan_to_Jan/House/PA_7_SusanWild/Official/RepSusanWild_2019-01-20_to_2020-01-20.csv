As a member of @HouseForeign I condemn in the strongest terms both this reckless foreign policy and his enablers’ continued support. Their words are not enough and sanctions while hopefully having a deterring effect on Turkey are too little too late. 5/7,2019-10-14 22:43:05,Twitter for iPhone,3,13
I remember when @GOP used to claim they were the party of national security. Well the cat’s out of the bag and their spinelessness is endangering our safety. By enabling this President’s worst tendencies they are putting lives at risk and allowing terrorists to roam free. 4/7,2019-10-14 22:43:05,Twitter for iPhone,3,15
They tweet condemnations shake their fists and put on a show for the cameras. But when it comes time to act they do nothing. Their silence on his disastrous decisions and continued unwillingness to confront him make them equally accountable for new dangers posed by ISIS. 3/7,2019-10-14 22:43:04,Twitter for iPhone,2,15
ISIS is again running rampant because of his actions and innocent human beings are being murdered in the streets of #Syria.  And make no mistake these atrocities are enabled by the President’s Republican supporters in Congress. 2/7,2019-10-14 22:43:04,Twitter for iPhone,2,15
Let’s be clear: this is a crisis of @realDonaldTrump’s own making.  With his latest reckless foreign policy decision to abandon our Kurdish partners (at the urging of Turkey’s government no less) he has endangered our allies and our country 1/7 https://t.co/nEbB7sBix7,2019-10-14 22:43:04,Twitter for iPhone,30,64

.@USWNT I know what it's like to be dismissed in the fight for #equalpay but despite the critics we know it's worth the fight.

If repealed many of the 800K+ Pennsylvanians who qualify for #Medicaid under the #ACA would lose the healthcare they gained for the first time.

Healthcare is not a partisan issue it’s an American issue. Hundreds of millions of ppl including 5.3M Pennsylvanians rely on the #ACA. If repealed 858K Pennsylvanians including 89K young adults would lose coverage leading to a 133% increase in the uninsured rate.,2019-07-08 20:23:26,Twitter Web App,7,13
If #TexasvUS is upheld &amp; the #ACA is repealed #Medicaid expansion historic protections for ppl with #PreExistingConditions the ban on lifetime caps on coverage the rule allowing kids to stay on their parents’ health insurance until they're 26 will all disappear along with it,2019-07-08 20:23:25,Twitter Web App,8,10

Raising the minimum wage is a commitment to giving our workers a chance to lift themselves and their families out of poverty to fight record income and wealth inequality across our country and to get to work building an economy that delivers for all Americans.,2019-06-17 17:58:57,Twitter Web App,1,9

🔹Takeaway #6:  The statistics on deaths due to drug overdoses are staggering - the kind of numbers we see during wartime.   But Easton is doing a great job saving lives and bringing these numbers down thanks to community members like these folks.,2019-04-23 01:08:14,Twitter for iPhone,1,4
🔹Takeaway #5:  People in #PA07 are doing amazing work to take care of our community in this time of crisis by working together to create environments that are conducive to recovery. Another prime example 👇   https://t.co/A2yVO4YaLc,2019-04-23 01:08:14,Twitter for iPhone,1,9

🔹Takeaway #3  “We are not going to arrest our way out of this problem.”   The Easton Police Department is seeing real results by offering help and connecting people with treatment programs.  https://t.co/ImRp7IVJAM,2019-04-23 01:08:13,Twitter for iPhone,1,5
🔹Takeaway #2:  We must raise awareness with parents who may not know how addiction could end up affecting their families and educate kids early on about how to prevent addiction to begin with.,2019-04-23 01:08:12,Twitter for iPhone,1,4
🔹Takeaway #1:   Just by talking about addiction and showing we care we can get closer to ending the stigma behind addiction that keeps too many people from seeking the treatment and help they need.,2019-04-23 01:08:12,Twitter for iPhone,2,5

Today @JoshShapiroPA &amp; I held a health care roundtable in #PA07 because listening to patients doctors &amp; hospital administrators &amp; letting their experiences guide the conversation is the 1st step to improving our health care system so it doesn't leave anybody behind - or broke. https://t.co/pCtk6myhWp,2019-04-16 20:32:13,Twitter for iPhone,9,39

Without adequate oversight by the Dept. of Ed states will have little incentive to improve educational outcomes.

Not every student in my district is on a level playing field. There are school districts in need in #PA07 - that are distressed &amp; in need of resources.

Too many people are getting hurt - or worse - on the job &amp; not enough people are talking about it. We're working to fix that.

Instead of doing more to protect our workers and improve worker safety the Dept. of Labor has rolled back worker safety rules and proposed cuts to @OSHA_DOL.

The #PaycheckFairnessAct would:  ➡️Require employers to prove that pay disparities exist for real job-related reasons ➡️Ban retaliation against workers who discuss pay ➡️Help @USDOL enforce the #EqualPayAct ➡️Let workers join lawsuits that challenge systemic pay discrimination,2019-02-13 18:52:16,Twitter Web Client,2,8
The pay gap doesn't just affect the women who are not making as much money as they are worth. It hurts families &amp; our economy.

It’s been over 50 years since the #EqualPayAct passed - yet women still make an avg 80 cents for every dollar a man makes (&amp; even less for women of color).
