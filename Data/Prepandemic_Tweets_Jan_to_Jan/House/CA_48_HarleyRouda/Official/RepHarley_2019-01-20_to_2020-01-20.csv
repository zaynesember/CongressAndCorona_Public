If we want to talk about national emergencies we should be talking about the opioid crisis the gun violence crisis and climate change--which Orange County residents have to deal with every day. These are true national crises that need our attention. https://t.co/fWWgcSRt9p,2019-02-13 17:03:53,Twitter Web Client,26,104

I’ll be talking with @SandraSmithFox on @FoxNews at 8:40am PT/11:40 ET. Hope you’ll tune in!,2019-02-13 15:28:15,Twitter for iPhone,6,22
This morning I spoke with federal employees at @AFGENational. The only federal employees who should lose their paychecks in a shutdown are in Congress the Cabinet and White House. It’s time we stop talking about shutdowns and start talking about strengthening the middle class. https://t.co/3G80ZvvDCG,2019-02-13 14:24:26,Twitter for iPhone,26,122
Today I met with @MFOLDC and @Team_Enough. The anniversary of the Parkland shooting is two days away– and nearly 1200 kids have died from gun violence in a year of Congressional inaction. It's past time to pass H.R. 8 and expand background checks and that’s just the first step. https://t.co/O8UDGC1hKh,2019-02-12 21:30:58,Twitter Web Client,32,116
The Dept of Interior wants to drill everywhere and ignore environmental consequences including off the OC Coast. I'm cosponsoring @RepHuffman and @RepBrianFitz's bill to keep drilling out of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. This administration needs a reality check. https://t.co/9alaXmLvcl,2019-02-12 19:45:23,Twitter Web Client,31,94
I just wrapped up a meeting with @TSA workers who are deeply concerned about the the looming possibility of another damaging shutdown. Federal employees can’t afford another manufactured crisis at their expense. It’s time for the President to get serious and work with us.,2019-02-12 16:56:04,Twitter for iPhone,23,93
Happy birthday to the @NAACP! Those of us in Congress can do justice to the organization's legacy by seeking out justice in the work we do here.,2019-02-12 15:59:48,Twitter Web Client,6,57

I'm proud to co-sponsor bipartisan legislation reaffirming congressional support for the Paris climate agreement. #ClimateChange is a global crisis and we are #StillIn. We can't afford to abandon our obligations to the global community and future generations. https://t.co/a0qJGqNI3X,2019-02-11 22:04:17,Twitter Web Client,56,194

They took a swing at California too–– #CA48 shouldn't be taxed twice on the same dollar. I'm proud to be an original cosponsor of the bipartisan SALT Act. https://t.co/CSPJOaXZNq,2019-02-11 16:53:29,Twitter Web Client,30,144
The Post's report confirms that the EPA has abandoned its watch under the Trump Admin. Congress won’t let this administration sell out the future of humankind to fossil fuel interests. We will be taking action to fight the Climate Crisis and the EPA will be held to account. https://t.co/5aEBIqZvuJ,2019-02-08 22:53:13,Twitter Web Client,40,141
At the @TransportDems hearing yesterday I talked about the intersection between infrastructure and climate change. The climate crisis is the greatest threat to humankind and green infrastructure is an opportunity to #ActOnClimate and modernize our economy. https://t.co/MhRJv5bYYg,2019-02-08 22:26:44,Twitter Web Client,9,62
I cosponsored the Veterans’ Access to Child Care Act which passed today with bipartisan support. #ChildCare4Vets is just common sense--it expands childcare services during appointments at the VA. Veterans shouldn’t have to choose between healthcare and taking care of their kids. https://t.co/pcS0T2nkwv,2019-02-08 18:57:52,Twitter Web Client,28,100
This transportation and infrastructure hearing is (refreshingly) light on partisanship and bluster. It's clear basically everyone here is dead serious about understanding this issue and getting to work on an infrastructure package. Let's get it done. https://t.co/0J2scejMCM,2019-02-07 18:48:48,Twitter Web Client,29,173
This administration has had at best an awkward relationship with ethics. We must pass H.R. 1 to ensure that public servants can’t use their offices to enrich themselves. https://t.co/yPkYDsruz3,2019-02-06 18:18:16,Twitter Web Client,35,194
This morning I rose in response to the #SOTU “We should not wait for nor expect the president to lead an agenda for the people. But we can move forward...and work with one another regardless of party to improve the lives of the people who trusted us to represent them” https://t.co/QUKuc6Jx2X,2019-02-06 15:25:08,Twitter Web Client,36,146
Cleaning up our democracy is the first step to cleaning up our environment. If oil &amp; gas interests have Washington in a vice grip Congress can’t fight climate change. I support H.R.1 and look forward to today’s @OversightDems hearing on executive branch ethics. #ActOnClimate,2019-02-06 14:35:03,Twitter Web Client,59,253
Also had a chance to chat with @nbcla about #SOTU and calling on the President to support bipartisan infrastructure and immigration solutions https://t.co/X61ZjFw9Sx,2019-02-05 23:54:55,Twitter for iPhone,18,50

As we prepare for the State of the Union tonight there is one issue we know the president will fail to address: the looming climate crisis. Seal Beach and all of Orange County need action instead of denial from the EPA.  https://t.co/FThs8hzCXU,2019-02-05 20:36:14,Twitter Web Client,51,146

Orange County folks: stay safe during the storm tonight and this weekend there’s a flood warning.

My next stop was @PPOSBC’s newest health center in Costa Mesa. No other healthcare provider has to shoulder political motivated attacks at their literal doorstep but they continue to provide essential healthcare for women.

Yesterday afternoon I had an opportunity to tour Jamboree Housing's affordable housing communities serving #CA48 today.

.@CBP just reported the largest seizure of fentanyl in US History– at a port of entry. Not a dime of the billions @realDonaldTrump wants for his wall would have supported their work. That money should go towards the proven technologies &amp; infrastructure that agents are asking for.,2019-01-31 21:12:18,Twitter Web Client,98,324
Landed in OC last night– this morning enjoying breathing ocean air again. Looking forward to touring Jamboree Housing and Planned Parenthood this afternoon and capping off the day with a Tết Celebration in Costa Mesa this evening.

Acting EPA Admin Wheeler wants to be confirmed to run the agency but he says he hasn’t been briefed on the alarming National Climate Assessment. It’s past time he catches up on climate science and shows he’s willing to take action to reverse our course on climate change. https://t.co/TC4DY0OdTk,2019-01-30 21:26:38,Twitter Web Client,20,70
Yesterday showed us how Congress can work without the partisan incivility we’ve all come to take for granted.

Let’s have more days like yesterday -HR,2019-01-30 17:31:39,Twitter Web Client,12,85
The people of OC sent me to Congress to lead on the existential issue of climate change. Yesterday my chairmanship of the @OversightDems Environment subcommittee was made official and we’re ready to work. @realdonaldtrump’s EPA won’t get away with denying the threat any longer. https://t.co/ejpk4v4Bga,2019-01-30 16:23:42,Twitter Web Client,145,690
Ten years ago President Obama signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. The law was a big step in recognizing that women deserve equal pay for equal work but the fight isn’t over.,2019-01-29 22:41:02,Twitter Web Client,42,221
In our first @OversightDems hearing I called for a holistic approach to prescription drug reform. The real cost of drugs is opaque to even the most seasoned expert—it might as well be a foreign language to patients. Patients deserve transparency across the system. https://t.co/pxkfwsRtvo,2019-01-29 20:49:36,Twitter for iPhone,108,320
One of my responsibilities as a member of Congress is to support &amp; coordinate with local government to be responsive to our constituents.

The past four years have been the hottest on record. This is a fact consistent with the long-term trend of global warming and one that’s been under-reported: versions from @NASA and the @NOAA were indefinitely postponed due to the #TrumpShutdown.  https://t.co/IbECJsUnOg,2019-01-25 22:00:00,Twitter Web Client,27,71
It took 35 days for @realdonaldtrump to admit that he lost the shutdown. This is the same exact deal Congress put forth in December. He closed the government on false pretenses and all he has to show for it is the pain he caused hundreds of thousands of families. https://t.co/jUabe7sSLq,2019-01-25 19:43:37,Twitter Web Client,156,424
Although the King Tides occur only twice a year they offer insight into the prospective damage that normal tides will bring due to rising sea levels. #ClimateChange is a real and visible threat in the #CA48 district.  https://t.co/qVVDEh8oBE,2019-01-25 18:22:31,Twitter Web Client,22,77

55 years ago the American people fought for their right to vote when the states ratified the 24th Amendment to outlaw poll taxes in federal elections.
