It is in this spirit that I ran for the 48th Congressional District of California in 2017 and with that same commitment I ask for your continued support.  I hope you can join us this Saturday at our 2020 Re-Election Campaign Kickoff.  RSVP: https://t.co/CD0Qt4u1cO,2019-08-22 23:50:39,Twitter Web App,27,89
Despite our successes the NRCC has identified our race as a top target putting party over the people of the 48th.  I believe in using common sense for common ground and being an accessible and unifying Congressional Representative for all constituents.,2019-08-22 23:50:39,Twitter Web App,32,110

Singling out the Jewish community for lack of fealty to an individual is the calling card of anti-Semitic totalitarianism. We’ve seen this throughout history and now we see it repeated by the leader of the free world.,2019-08-21 17:58:34,Twitter Web App,74,316
Trump continues to claim there’s an economic conspiracy against him but the data in our district paints a different picture. He needs to stop his trade war and work with Congress to make the economy work for all Americans. https://t.co/AeS4JH6PgW,2019-08-19 15:30:26,Twitter for iPhone,22,58

I’m a businessman. Recessions mean layoffs and bankruptcy. Health insurance lost. Savings drained. You think your re-election is the first thing on folks’ minds? Please.

These protestors are doing the most patriotic thing citizens can do. At great personal risk they’re standing up for democracy human rights and liberty. To the people of Hong Kong: Americans stand with you. https://t.co/NzNbgKX5xq,2019-08-13 18:51:54,Twitter for iPhone,158,529

In a groundswell ahead of 2020 grassroots groups banded together to register peers to vote. It’s one of the most patriotic actions one can take.

I’m heartbroken and disgusted.  Thoughts and prayers from NRA apologists in Congress are insulting to victims. Their silence is deafening— It makes them permissive even complicit in this epidemic.

Today we mourn more deaths at the hand of the gun violence epidemic less than a week since deaths in California. Our hearts go out to the community in El Paso.

If you’re a parent just try to imagine the kind of pain in Gilroy. It’s clear too many politicians have stopped trying.  The House sent two life saving reforms to the Senate Clerk’s desk.

I’ve called out Dems for tropes they’ve used too. Speaking out only against the other party doesn’t require a whole lot of courage or principles—and it’s time for GOP elected leaders to speak against Trump’s dangerous words.   Wrong is wrong no matter what side it comes from.,2019-07-16 16:44:32,Twitter for iPhone,41,239
While in NYC taping a town hall with @NextRevFNC I caught a show and ran into my friend @DougJones!
