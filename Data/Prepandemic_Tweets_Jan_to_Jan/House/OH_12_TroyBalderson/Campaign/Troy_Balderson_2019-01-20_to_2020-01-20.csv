The foundation of our republic is under attack.  The Constitution gives the right to due process yet the president was not afforded this fundamental right. “Witnesses” with no firsthand knowledge lack any evidence.  This impeachment goes against everything America stands for.,2019-12-18 17:59:42,Twitter for iPhone,17,60

I used to fix cars. When I got an engine up-and-running customers never asked me to change the motor back to the way it was before. Right now there are politicians threatening to do exactly that with our economy.

At Licking Co’s Lincoln Day Dinner &amp; Marion Co’s Harding Day Dinner I reaffirmed that the US will never be a socialist country.
