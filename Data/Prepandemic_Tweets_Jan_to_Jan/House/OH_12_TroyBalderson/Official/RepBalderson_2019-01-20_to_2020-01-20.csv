Nice being joined by fellow Buckeye Larry Krauter CEO of @iflyspokane (formerly of CMH) at today's @TransportGOP hearing. Larry discussed the difficulties small- and medium-sized airports have receiving the same resources as larger commercial airports and what we can do to help https://t.co/Q9IUJCny0Y,2019-02-07 21:22:14,TweetDeck,1,7
.@GovTimWalz is right — that's why I introduced the End Government Shutdowns Act (H.R. 791) which would prevent future shutdowns from happening in the first place. This would ensure local governments aren't starved by an approps impasse and get their much-needed carrots 🥕 https://t.co/aDPuvRjBkd,2019-02-07 17:38:12,TweetDeck,3,3
Great to hear from @GovTimWalz of Minnesota at today's @TransportGOP hearing. I asked how Congress can promote public-private partnerships to drive innovation and how to ensure government agencies are communicating to meet rural constituents' needs. https://t.co/QHLgLOP0gV,2019-02-07 17:22:32,TweetDeck,2,4
I recently had the privilege of touring @columbusairport's air traffic control tower. Staff access to tools and resources is critical to safety. Glad that Fmr. Trans. Sec. @RayLaHood agrees. We need to resolve a labor shortage of qualified ATC workers to ensure everyone's safety. https://t.co/Ypgnk8dM2A,2019-02-07 16:35:01,TweetDeck,1,4

Proud to stand with @SteveScalise and @RepAnnWagner by cosponsoring their legislation to protect life's most precious gift—life itself.

We need bipartisanship now more than ever. Congress must come together to find solutions to our nation's most challenging problems including action to prevent another shutdown like the one we just had. That's why I introduced the End Govt. Shutdowns Act: https://t.co/l7MdHO7Wzl https://t.co/k4k6mJOG38,2019-01-31 15:45:11,TweetDeck,1,4

I’m proud to introduce my first legislation the House version of @SenRobPortman’s End Government Shutdowns Act.
