Trump welcomed foreign interference in 2016 and tried to cover it up.  He’s using the presidency for financial gain and obstructing Congress.

Curious thing here.  President claiming executive privilege to try to prevent the American people from seeing the entire document that he claims “completely exonerated” him. Wonder why?,2019-05-08 14:35:07,Echofon,751,2495
The President already waived executive privilege. McGahn gave 30 hours of testimony to Mueller. Trying to stop McGahn from testifying in public is laughable.

The Attorney General’s press conference to spin the report in favor of the President was a contemptible effort to undermine the rule of law for this administration’s benefit.   Roy Cohn must be looking up and smiling.,2019-04-18 15:28:14,Twitter for iPhone,62,346
