Under Secretary DeVos’ latest scheme..   • 97% of the loans taken out by defrauded borrowers will NOT be forgiven.  • 99% of the loans taken out by defrauded borrowers will be repaid by students and taxpayers.   Today @HouseDemocrats took action to #StandWithStudents,2020-01-16 21:15:35,Twitter for iPhone,5,8
Instead of working with the victims of predatory for-profit colleges like ITT tech and Corinthian  Secretary DeVos chose to give these “schools” a handout.    #StandWithStudents https://t.co/ajhrwpCzWl,2020-01-16 21:08:50,Twitter for iPhone,6,8

This is more proof that the Senate needs to hear from firsthand witnesses like John Bolton. #DefendOurDemocracy https://t.co/PYIneswsUF,2020-01-16 16:08:23,Twitter Web App,11,10
The President’s abuse of power struck at the heart of our democracy and national security–It is absolutely inexcusable for the Senate to refuse available witnesses and documents in considering it.  No witnesses + No evidence = Cover-up.   #DefendOurDemocracy https://t.co/B5mhRDiVdl,2020-01-16 14:34:33,Twitter Web App,7,16

@senatemajldr During the Clinton Impeachment the Senate saw all evidence and heard from **3 witnesses** before the trial even started.    Today @SenateMajLdr will allow neither evidence nor witnesses.    #EndTheCoverUp #DefendOurDemocracy,2020-01-14 18:09:33,Twitter Web App,4,4
@senatemajldr During the Clinton impeachment Dem Sen.
