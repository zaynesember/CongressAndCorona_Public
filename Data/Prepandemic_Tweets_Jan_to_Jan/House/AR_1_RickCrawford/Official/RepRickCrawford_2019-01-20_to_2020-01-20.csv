The truth is nothing the President did rises to impeachment. He discussed a visit to the WH in April with the Ukraine President. Pres Zelensky has said he wasn’t pressured &amp; no quid-pro-quo. This started hours in to Pres Trumps presidency. It’s been a #shampeachment from day one!,2019-12-03 19:30:41,Twitter for iPhone,6,13
The President through the Constitution sets the foreign policy of the United States. In Schiff’s #shampeachment only one witness talked to the President. He was told “no quid pro quo” &amp; “tell the truth” to Congress. At least three different “charges” this is “abuse of power”?,2019-12-03 19:30:39,Twitter for iPhone,10,20

“He got caught” is the last ditch effort by Schiff and others to salvage their tanking #Shampeachment effort.

The one who seems to be the angriest &amp; who isn’t willing to accept the testimony of these witnesses is Adam Schiff. His narrative is gone. The President said “no quid-pro-quo” “Go tell the truth” and the aid was sent w/out meetings/investigations. Total #shampeachment folks.,2019-11-21 21:16:47,Twitter for iPhone,345,763
There is no denial from any House R that there was Russian interference. The Russia Hoax (Steele Dossier) is what Schiff’s party nominee &amp; he himself are still trying to dismiss. Some of those very same entities were similarly involved in Ukraine. This is a #Shampeachment https://t.co/x9MDHjzrvS,2019-11-21 21:09:50,Twitter for iPhone,20,39
A call heard some of some he didn’t. Some wasn’t word for word some was. He told everyone he knew what he heard... but the Ambassador doesn’t recall it at all.

“It wasn’t a word for word” is what he said at one point while remembering verbatim others. Sure seems Schiffty in his recollection - and the Ambassador even said something different than what he assumed. It’s a #Shampeachment folks. Plain and simple. https://t.co/qeu12Suzby,2019-11-21 19:51:03,Twitter for iPhone,6,22
You couldn’t find any HPSCI Republicans who think that Russia *didnt* interfere in the 2016 election because they did. This week it would be hard to find any Democrat witnesses who think Ukraine *also* interfered in ‘16. Confirmation bias? #shampeachment  https://t.co/qjpzrSPqwM,2019-11-21 17:30:31,Twitter for iPhone,5,14
One of the witnesses was pushing in 2015 *against* giving lethal military aid to Ukraine even wrote an op-Ed on it. Today she says she was pushing for the release of the same aid to Ukraine. Seems like this is an important part of her testimony: #shampeachment https://t.co/sTT4l9k3Zu,2019-11-21 16:57:51,Twitter for iPhone,356,850
Are we back to “abuse of power” or is this something that is the “quid-pro-quo” that didn’t poll very well? I’m having a hard time keeping the charges against a President who said “No quid-pro-quo” &amp; “I want Zelensky to do the right thing” and “Go tell the truth” #shampeachment https://t.co/7cYZtPbKCN,2019-11-21 16:38:43,Twitter for iPhone,3,9
Most if not all of today’s testimony is based on what they discussed with Ambassador Sondland who said yesterday he made his own presumptions (guesses) about the aid.  The President told Sondland “no quid pro quo” so todays opinions are not relevant. #shampeachment,2019-11-21 16:29:58,Twitter for iPhone,19,49
Nancy Pelosi just outlined the requirements she has for Mexico as it pertains to #USMCA and if they aren't willing to alter/change some things there is no path forward. Since there is a significant financial benefit to them on this did she just outline her quid-pro-quo?,2019-11-21 16:19:58,Twitter Web App,21,32
This witness overhead a phone call and made his own presumptions about its context and has been giving a prolonged opening statement about his views on foreign policy. They got the aid and the President sets foreign policy. Maybe a free lunch wasn’t enough. #shampeachment,2019-11-21 15:11:07,Twitter for iPhone,12,29
You might recall what Ambassador Sondland said about this yesterday....just in case. He also asked how many calls today’s witness had with the President.... answer was zero. #shampeachment  ⬇️ https://t.co/KDVlT1wQ4a,2019-11-21 14:58:14,Twitter for iPhone,8,11
The current witness is disappointed that the person who sets the foreign policy of the United States - the President - didn’t use his talking points or information. There seems to be a pattern that folks don’t like the authority of the President #Shampeachment,2019-11-21 14:54:00,Twitter for iPhone,430,1514

As today’s witnesses begin their testimony it seems redundant but a Constitutional fact that foreign policy is set by the President. A President who didn’t say to anyone he wanted “quid pro quo” and to one he did speak to said “Go tell the truth” to Congress  #Shampeachment,2019-11-21 14:38:21,Twitter for iPhone,51,112
As another impeachment hearing gets underway here are the facts from this week:  - No meeting or visit or aid was withheld that has been alleged for the “quid pro quo”  - The one person who actually talked to the President was told “no quid pro quo”  - This is a #shampeachment,2019-11-21 14:09:24,Twitter for iPhone,8,17

.@RepBradWenstrup - “Two presumptions plus two presumptions” don’t equal a fact.

Under consistent badgering and leading by the HPSCI Democrat members about what "quid-pro-quo" means to the President - aka mind reading - he simply wont "admit" or conform to their narrative.

These are the tactics that Schiff and Pelosi are deploying - making rules that benefit their “Quid-pro-quo-bribery-obstruction-quid-pro-quo” claims about the President. Keep testimony from the American people AND other witnesses. #SameSchiffDifferentDay https://t.co/WHcw99ZR2J,2019-11-20 18:08:46,Twitter for iPhone,6,14
“Not only did I buy him lunch I provided him some entertainment... great” - Ambassador Sondland in reference to the “witness” to his phone call with the President. He went on to question how many conversations the other witness had... presumably none. #SameSchiffDifferentDay,2019-11-20 17:56:00,Twitter for iPhone,9,22
.@DevinNunes makes a critical point in which the witness agreed that if we had testimony from more involved he wouldn’t need to infer or assume... but Schiff won’t let those individuals come testify. That simply doesn’t add up to fairness &amp; transparency #SameSchiffDifferentDay,2019-11-20 17:51:15,Twitter for iPhone,10,15
Schiff is trying get the witness to testify he heard something from the President that he did not say &amp; no matter how hard Schiff tried it didn’t work. The President didn’t tell him that and he had to repeatedly say that. It’s #SameSchiffDifferentDay #Shampeachment,2019-11-20 17:42:39,Twitter for iPhone,8,19
He also remembers what the President told him directly - that he wanted no quid-pro-quo and for Zelensky to do the right thing.  #SameSchiffDifferentDay https://t.co/90oLsqgIRn,2019-11-20 17:23:27,Twitter for iPhone,228,576

Maybe this explains why Schiff &amp; Company pivoted to “bribery” when “quid-pro-quo” wasn’t working. However no one told one of the witnesses that they felt any pressure to investigate.

Had a great time speaking to Ms. Thomas’s 5th grade class at Brookland Elementary as well as the Paragould Rotary Club. Questions of the day ranged from how old I am to how we can ignite the spirit of bipartisanship in Washington. Thanks for having me! https://t.co/2fSJumKd04,2019-02-22 21:59:08,Twitter for iPhone,0,13
A blast from the past. Sounds familiar. https://t.co/y01F3DKh4x,2019-02-20 03:37:10,Twitter for iPhone,16,23
So proud of my Chief of Staff! Take a few minutes and listen in to the inaugural edition of “Talk is Chief” to get a little perspective on what’s going on in DC. Jonah is a great Chief public servant and friend. Listen yourself and you’ll agree. https://t.co/AsIfbOe30B,2019-02-20 00:07:40,Twitter for iPhone,1,7
It’s unfortunate that it’s come to this. But if Democrats in Congress are unwilling to help provide the necessary tools for the President to secure our borders and keep our nation safe then he’s left with very few options.,2019-02-15 14:14:37,Twitter for iPhone,5,27

@Nomdermaet @JeffBezos I have it on good authority @JeffBezos pays close attention to feedback from folks and if he sees how interested folks from #AR1 are maybe he will re-consider. 🤷🏻‍♂️,2019-02-14 22:57:45,Twitter for iPhone,0,3

. @JeffBezos I’d like to suggest the former Eaker AFB near Blytheville AR as your new location. Low energy costs low cost of living close proximity to FedEx in Memphis multi mode transportation a thriving steel industry ASU’s back yard and a ready and willing workforce.,2019-02-14 19:09:29,Twitter for iPhone,30,92

I learned earlier this evening my colleague Walter Jones passed away. He was always the kindest gentleman who even in disagreement did so with the utmost respect for his colleagues - on either side of the aisle. His genteel manner will be missed in the halls of Congress.,2019-02-11 01:24:35,Twitter for iPhone,1,10

Unchecked middlemen should not be allowed to retroactively snatch money from small business owners and the seniors they serve. I applaud the Administration’s efforts to provide access to affordable medications and increase transparency within the Part D program. (1/2),2019-02-01 21:18:26,Twitter for iPhone,8,32

While I’m grateful that this shipment was intercepted at a border crossing by the dedicated folks at CBP we all have to realize other shipments are not found and not all shipments come across in this manner. #BorderSecurity https://t.co/oBm8jYeAn4,2019-01-31 18:38:59,Twitter for iPhone,7,18

Cost for this proposal?  $32trillion dollars.   Percent of people who support it when they find out its cost in dollars and changes to the care they have now?  About the same number - 37%.   Even lower if they’re told it would lead to delays in care.   https://t.co/lWhqXaNIjN,2019-01-23 19:47:07,Twitter for iPhone,2,5

About a year ago @SpeakerPelosi spoke for over 8 hours about the importance of protecting our nation's dreamers. Now that she has the opportunity to actually do so she is refusing to come to the table.
