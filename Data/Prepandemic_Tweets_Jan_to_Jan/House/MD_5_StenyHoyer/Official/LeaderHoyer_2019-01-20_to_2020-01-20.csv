Non-partisan civil servants must be able to do their work for the American people w/o fear of political retribution. Political attacks on public servants are unacceptable &amp; undermine the functioning of govt. Those who retaliate against civil servants should be held accountable. https://t.co/gQV5EWPt7L,2019-11-22 16:12:22,Twitter Web App,9,19

I thank Dr. Fiona Hill and David Holmes for their important testimony today which shed light on the alarming scheme directed by the President to bribe Ukraine to investigate a political rival. House Dems will #DefendOurDemocracy,2019-11-21 22:39:20,Twitter for iPhone,19,79
Dr. Fiona Hill and David Holmes are absolutely right. It would set a terrible precedent for Congress to allow a president of the United States to ask a foreign government to investigate a political rival.  The President’s actions cannot go ignored. https://t.co/uLCZ05FRGF,2019-11-21 20:52:16,Twitter Web App,64,207
A domestic political errand.   That’s how Dr. Fiona Hill described Ambassador Sondland’s work who was a key player in the President’s scheme to bribe a foreign government. That’s exactly what it was. https://t.co/ug7sTUpLMP,2019-11-21 19:52:56,Twitter Web App,27,78
David Holmes provided a clear picture for the American people of POTUS’s pressure campaign on Ukraine which was all about benefiting him politically and had nothing to do with addressing corruption. https://t.co/9NKVRIqDZp,2019-11-21 16:39:27,Twitter Web App,18,63
In bribing Ukraine to interfere in our elections the President has undermined national security and sown doubt that the U.S. stands firmly with Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression.   Who benefits from this scheme?   Putin. https://t.co/asV0GANHVn,2019-11-21 16:10:38,Twitter Web App,25,61
I commend Dr. Fiona Hill for setting the record straight like many previous witnesses have done. Russia – not Ukraine – interfered in the 2016 election. To suggest otherwise as Republicans have plays right into the hands of Putin. https://t.co/XWL1lE1rNL,2019-11-21 16:07:25,Twitter Web App,52,203
The transcript of the President’s call with Zelensky had nothing to do with American interests only his own political interests. https://t.co/tqyM1imEdd,2019-11-21 15:56:23,Twitter Web App,56,145
Holmes just testified to the direct role Giuliani and an entire network of White House officials had in compromising our national security priorities and support for Ukraine in its fight against Russia. This is damning. https://t.co/ylXAmSiTIY,2019-11-21 15:34:09,Twitter Web App,72,152
The American people will also hear from David Holmes a nonpartisan career foreign service officer and a firsthand witness to Ambassador’s Sondland’s call with President Trump about his scheme to bribe Ukraine.,2019-11-21 14:41:31,Twitter Web App,4,18
Ambassador Sondland’s testimony shed light on the truth of the President’s actions: - He directed a scheme to bribe Ukraine. - There was a quid pro quo. - Everyone knew. https://t.co/2KZPOYkK2a,2019-11-21 14:30:34,Twitter Web App,17,42
This morning Fiona Hill an expert on Russian &amp; Eurasian affairs will testify &amp; dispel the GOP’s false claims that Ukraine – not Russia – interfered in our election. The GOP must stop peddling conspiracy theories as a way to blindly defend POTUS &amp; #DefendOurDemocray. https://t.co/wDdam3HWVt,2019-11-21 14:28:29,Twitter Web App,14,36
I am pleased to share the House legislative schedule for 2020. It ensures that Members have time in Washington to work on legislation that addresses the concerns of the American people &amp; have time to conduct important work in their districts. #ForThePeople https://t.co/b03cZi1cg2,2019-11-21 14:19:39,Twitter Web App,8,9
I thank @HouseIntel for their work today. It was a critical day in this impeachment inquiry and our efforts to pursue the truth for the American people and #DefendOurDemocracy.,2019-11-21 01:30:30,Twitter Web App,13,57
Witnesses we heard from this evening also explained to the public why it matters that aid was withheld and what’s at stake: it’s important for the U.S. to deter Russian aggression in Ukraine and around the world.,2019-11-21 01:30:30,Twitter Web App,6,19
The American people heard directly from Ambassador Sondland that POTUS directed a scheme to bribe Ukraine there was a quid pro quo and everyone knew. Then we learned Ukraine knew too – as early as the 7/25 phone call.,2019-11-21 01:30:30,Twitter Web App,18,42
