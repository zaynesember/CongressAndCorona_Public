The @WSJ correctly points out that Dems' strategy of a sham impeachment in secret won't persuade the American people but "will look instead like a railroad job with the goal of branding Mr. Trump 'impeached' to please the Democratic and media left." https://t.co/KQstxKLNUP,2019-10-10 15:33:01,Twitter Web App,15,24
