Our political climate has grown steadily nastier in recent years and it's only become worse since the death of Senator John McCain one year ago. As we reflect on his service his family has asked us to honor his legacy with #ActsOfCivility.   https://t.co/kSH4UzYYeT,2019-08-21 18:52:32,Twitter Web App,1,13

Planned Parenthood has 2 clinics in #MN03 and half of patients at those clinics directly rely on Title X to afford their care.

We shouldn’t cap anyone’s pay but it’s time we consider incentives for companies to share more success with employees.

Without a shred of doubt: Russia meddled in the 2016 election and plans to continue its influence campaign in 2020.

What President Trump didn’t talk about:  ❌ How his tax scam harms countless Minnesota families who can’t claim their full SALT deductions.  ❌ How it adds more than 1.4 trillion dollars to our national debt.  ❌ His attacks on affordable accessible health care for Minnesotans. https://t.co/BmKzA9YLqZ,2019-04-15 23:18:24,Twitter Web Client,40,151
Half of all #MN03 tax filers take advantage of SALT deductions averaging $17500 each. But the GOP tax bill capped those deductions and today thousands of families are feeling the crunch.

I applaud @POTUS’s call for bipartisanship reducing the cost of healthcare &amp; prescriptions fighting childhood cancer investing in infrastructure &amp; paid family leave. But we can’t forget about draining the swamp: ethics reform voter protection &amp; campaign finance reform. #HR1,2019-02-06 04:30:05,Twitter for iPhone,34,268

This wasn’t high school. This wasn’t college. This was during medical school in the 1980’s. The people of Virginia will dictate Gov. Northam’s future but one thing is clear; elected officials should be held to the same standard no matter which political party they represent. https://t.co/QFYtPKyfrS,2019-02-01 23:56:21,Twitter for iPhone,49,255
Are you appalled by our #27 ranking in voter turnout among developed democracies? I am. That’s why I’m co-sponsoring #HR1 the #ForThePeopleAct to make Election Day a holiday registration easier &amp; voting more accessible to millions of Americans. Isn’t that our job?@House_DRTF https://t.co/Ulyf9i5EDu,2019-01-31 20:57:54,Twitter for iPhone,78,345
Sen. McConnell opposes making Election Day a holiday because he believes federal employees already have enough days off. So let’s make a deal and trade Columbus Day for Election Day. The day we vote is worthy of such reverence. Retweet if you agree. https://t.co/ypOejyOsLe,2019-01-31 00:47:10,Twitter for iPhone,8503,9352

I was proud to join my freshmen colleagues today to introduce #HR834 The Shutdown to End All Shutdowns (SEAS) Act to eliminate this destructive political tactic once and for all.

Seventy-fours years ago today  the #Auschwitz concentration camp was liberated - ending one of the darkest chapters of human history. With fewer and fewer survivors still living it is now up to us to share their stories and ensure it never happens again. #WeRemember⁠,2019-01-28 01:24:55,Twitter for iPhone,33,234
It’s time for Friday Follow-Up II. The shutdown is over! Negotiations will begin immediately and I hope to inspire bold and permanent solutions for border security and immigration reform - including DACA TPS and DED which I’ve implored be included in any deal. https://t.co/WooU8odKl1,2019-01-25 22:43:39,Twitter for iPhone,27,227
The President just announced he’ll sign the 3-week continuing resolution to RE-OPEN government for which I and fellow D and R members of the Problem Solvers Caucus advocated during our meeting with him last week. Now it’s up to members of both parties to negotiate in good faith. https://t.co/WKLRgKSWra,2019-01-25 19:22:56,Twitter for iPhone,16,111

Legislation to re-open government that we‘ve already passed in the House will receive a vote in the Senate on Thursday. Sixty senators and one President can end this madness by week’s end and we can get to work immediately on a border security and immigration reform package. https://t.co/5LQ0Za9vxN,2019-01-22 21:08:11,Twitter for iPhone,16,118
A strong and brave America should encourage those of physical and mental fortitude to serve in our armed forces - no matter how they look pray or identify. Trans people now protecting our nation in uniform are far more honorable than those hoping to ban their service. #truth https://t.co/wdeagtlRNw,2019-01-22 19:37:54,Twitter for iPhone,54,248

From my memorable conversation w/Martin Luther King III last year at #WeDay to this morning’s #MLKBreakfastMN the legacy of Dr. King is living breathing and as powerful as ever.
