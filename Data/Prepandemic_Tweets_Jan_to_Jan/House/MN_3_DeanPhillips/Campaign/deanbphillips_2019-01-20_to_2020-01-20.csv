Just received an A+ rating from @StopBigMoney’s Action Fund scorecard - the first A+ I’ve earned in my life! As the only member of Congress to refuse all💰from PACs federal lobbyists and fellow members of Congress I’m on a mission to make that the rule - not the exception. https://t.co/b6xcnB6hZG,2020-01-17 15:01:05,Twitter for iPhone,10,58
Amy K All the Way! I’m proud to support @AmyKlobuchar for President because America needs her experience strength leadership and ability to transcend partisanship.

Thanks Woody! I’ll always have the cleanest coat in Congress. No PAC 💰. No federal lobbyist 💰. And no 💰 from fellow members of Congress or their committees. We must make that the standard not the exception. https://t.co/734cLYnYn9,2019-12-02 19:00:16,Twitter for iPhone,47,170

Public service takes a real toll on families and couples. Counseling strengthens relationships and should be encouraged not demeaned. Shame on the @NRCC for mocking the wonderful wife of a member of Congress my dear friend @JoeCunninghamSC. #familyvalues https://t.co/dNapcPqMrE,2019-09-27 19:21:40,Twitter for iPhone,28,142
