Qassem Soleimani has directed attacks at U.S. troops and has the blood of hundreds of American lives on his hands. Our brave men and women in uniform eliminated him from the battlefield. I think President Trump reacted restrained and appropriately.,2020-01-03 16:53:51,Twitter Web App,6,12

Kentuckians have received over 500 million robocalls so far this year. Enough is enough! I was proud to vote for the Pallone-Thune TRACED Act today to put an end to these frustrating calls. https://t.co/MCZ0tnISUW https://t.co/6BeOnnyfVZ,2019-12-04 20:11:54,TweetDeck,4,10

Illnesses caused by e-cigarettes &amp; rising drug prices are two major public health crises – yet Dems on @HouseCommerce scheduled hearings on them at the same time. Both of these issues deserve our undivided attention &amp; I am committed to working with my colleagues to address them. https://t.co/LhSz0ksEZF,2019-09-25 15:20:05,Twitter Web App,17,59
My colleagues and I on @HouseCommerce have worked on several bipartisan bills to lower drug prices. Instead of moving any of them @SpeakerPelosi is introducing a radical leftwing plan that will lead to higher prices and stifle innovation. https://t.co/dloDJE8m9F,2019-09-20 19:45:09,TweetDeck,26,48

When I talk to employers in #KY02 I frequently hear that they have jobs available – they just need employees with the skills to do those jobs. Apprenticeships help bridge that skills gap.,2019-06-25 15:04:19,Twitter Web Client,2,5
Apprenticeships are a great way for employees to learn new skills on the job. I am very excited about the @USDOL’s new plan to support Industry-Recognized Apprenticeship programs.

Let’s remember what #measles can do to our children: Pneumonia swelling of the brain or even death. Parents for the sake of your own children and others please vaccinate your kids. https://t.co/yJxpypypV3,2019-06-04 17:51:39,Twitter Web Client,1,4
If you are a parent and unsure about the safety of the MMR vaccine for your child I urge you to talk to your pediatrician and check out the resources from @CDCgov about the #measles and vaccinations:  https://t.co/UQNUcG30zQ,2019-06-04 17:51:10,Twitter Web Client,0,2
Thank you also to @IvankaTrump for spreading the word on the importance of vaccines. I appreciate the all-hands-on-deck effort from the administration to prevent further measles outbreaks.  https://t.co/KP1eRo3bnz,2019-06-04 17:50:41,Twitter Web Client,0,0

This is simply untrue. The MMR vaccine is safe and necessary to prevent further outbreaks of measles which is highly contagious. I wrote about the viral spread of misinformation about vaccines in @CNNOpinion: https://t.co/yJxpypypV3,2019-06-04 17:49:46,Twitter Web Client,0,0
This number is tragic because #measles is preventable. We effectively eradicated measles in the U.S. with the development of the measles mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine but sadly some people believe the MMR vaccine is dangerous.,2019-06-04 17:49:18,Twitter Web Client,1,1
THREAD --&gt; Last week we hit a scary new record: According to the @CDCGov there are 971 confirmed #measles cases in the United States so far in 2019 the highest number in 25 years. https://t.co/0VZipb08Ma,2019-06-04 17:48:57,Twitter Web Client,0,2

Lowering prescription drug prices is a bipartisan issue.  Democrats are prioritizing politics over policy.   Watch my floor speech on the need for bipartisan legislation to lower drug prices: https://t.co/ZlUqj4TQjW,2019-05-16 18:31:37,TweetDeck,6,11
Democrats are shamelessly #ForThePolitics and have turned a bipartisan bill to lower drug prices into a partisan fight. I’ll be talking on the House floor shortly about my commitment to lowering drug prices in a bipartisan way. Watch: https://t.co/3u6WxwKF2h,2019-05-16 16:37:41,TweetDeck,6,17

Democrats are all about their Medicare for All proposal – until it comes time to actually legislating. Why won’t they hold a hearing at @HouseCommerce instead of at the Rules Committee? Because they know socializing medicine won’t actually work.,2019-04-30 18:24:14,TweetDeck,27,20
Thank you President @realDonaldTrump for bringing attention to this important issue.
