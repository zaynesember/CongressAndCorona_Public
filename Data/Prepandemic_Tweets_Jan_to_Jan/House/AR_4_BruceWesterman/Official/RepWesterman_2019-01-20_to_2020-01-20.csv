While we're at it why don't we vote to pass USMCA? Or secure the border? Or lower prescription drug costs? Or fund the government?

I agree! Forest management doesn't have to be a partisan issue. When it comes to protecting our forests against wildfires diseases and pests we should all be on the same team. https://t.co/o93hSOeEfE,2019-10-28 18:18:44,Twitter Web App,0,13
So what do we do? Start by recognizing that scientific practices like thinning allow trees to thrive and mitigate fire risk.  As urban areas continue growing larger and closer to forests we can't deny the issues at stake. Sound forest management must be our future.,2019-10-28 16:00:10,Twitter Web App,3,6
Refusing to manage forests isn't environmentally friendly it's just bad science. Dead diseased trees are not only releasing carbon into the air but they're also posing a greater fire risk.  Rather than acknowledging this congressional Dems continue pushing impractical plans.,2019-10-28 16:00:10,Twitter Web App,2,6

During horrible natural disasters like the current fires in California environmental activists immediately blame the GOP.

I support the bipartisan and commonsense "bright line" rules for net neutrality – no blocking no throttling and no paid prioritization – that protect consumers but the Save the Internet Act reaches far beyond these commonsense protections.,2019-04-10 16:05:23,Twitter Web Client,0,1
The internet isn’t broken so why are liberals trying to fix it? In H.R. 1644 House Democrats want to give federal entities nearly unlimited authority to regulate the internet which is why I voted against it.,2019-04-10 16:05:23,Twitter Web Client,1,5
@SpeakerPelosi should take up a VAWA bill that focuses exclusively on protecting women from violence instead of using her platform to push identity politics and politicize a historically bipartisan issue. /end,2019-04-08 22:05:51,Twitter Web Client,0,1
The bottom line: women deserve legislation that actually protects them and their well-being not a partisan package that advances the far-left’s political goals. I encourage you to contact your senators and urge them to stop this bad legislation. 5/6,2019-04-08 22:05:51,Twitter Web Client,0,4
3. Last week's bill included provisions like putting males who identify as female in female prisons allowing someone’s Second Amendment right to bear arms to be stripped for a misdemeanor and putting victims and their abusers in the same room for mediation attempts. 4/6,2019-04-08 22:05:51,Twitter Web Client,0,3
2. Then while I and many other Republicans tried to reauthorize VAWA in its entirety Democrats stalled so they could add liberal poison pills. 3/6,2019-04-08 22:05:51,Twitter Web Client,0,2
Every woman should be safeguarded against violence. But much as Democrats would like you to believe they're championing women's rights here's the real story.  1. VAWA only expired in the first place because @SpeakerPelosi used it as a bargaining chip during the shutdown. 2/6,2019-04-08 22:05:51,Twitter Web Client,0,2
Correcting the record on the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA): a thread.  House Dems brought a VAWA bill to the floor last week that I voted against.

In the midst of political difference time-honored traditions remind us of what we have in common. That's why I'm looking forward to the President's State of the Union Address tonight as we reflect on the past year and look forward to times of extraordinary promise ahead. #SOTU,2019-02-05 15:42:06,Twitter Web Client,1,3
Thrilled to see Charleston AR featured in the important work @ALALibrary is doing across the country.

2018 saw some of the worst recorded forest fires which is why I introduced an amendment to @NatResources hoping to ensure a 2019 focus on forest resiliency.  Every Committee Democrat voted against it which shows they'd rather toe party lines than accept commonsense provisions.,2019-01-30 17:21:00,Twitter Web Client,4,9
This year I’m thrilled to be seated on the Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources and the Subcommittee on National Parks Forests and Public Lands.   My time with @NatResources has been so rewarding and I look forward to continuing efforts to steward our resources well.,2019-01-30 12:44:06,Twitter for iPhone,5,14
Today the anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau is International Holocaust Remembrance Day. In the midst of life's busyness we take time to remember the 6 million victims of the Holocaust and continue telling their stories to generations to come. #WeRemember https://t.co/M6wqFJiyTo,2019-01-27 14:00:00,TweetDeck,6,26
Arkansas's wild natural beauty has always been home to me so I love when people from all over the country come to our state and experience the rugged landscape and friendly residents for the first time. A pleasure to host you @TrueDetective!  https://t.co/HQKBhmpa9g,2019-01-26 17:00:01,TweetDeck,3,13
@SpeakerPelosi and @SenSchumer have said for weeks that they would negotiate once the government was reopened. @POTUS has now given them the chance to fulfill that promise. Border security has long been an issue and it’s time to put party politics aside and solve this crisis.,2019-01-25 22:30:25,Twitter for iPhone,1,0
It's almost routine for the government to grind to a halt every year which is uncalled for. Dysfunction in the federal government is manifested in Congress’s inability to pass timely funding bills.  Once we fix appropriations we can fix the government. https://t.co/J9IvIZdBUV,2019-01-25 16:34:44,Twitter Web Client,0,6

"Because hospital spending is the largest component of U.S. health spending—representing one-third of the total—rising hospital prices threaten the affordability of health care and health insurance for those who can least bear their expense."

House Democrats are quick to say Trump is "holding federal workers hostage" but today marks the second time Democrats killed bills that would pay federal employees during the shutdown until a solution is reached.  It's high time this hypocrisy ends. https://t.co/4TneNs5ll0,2019-01-23 22:30:39,Twitter Web Client,7,10
Attempts by @SpeakerPelosi to block Trump's SOTU address on the House floor are petty and unnecessary.   If Speaker Pelosi was actually concerned about federal workers getting paid she would refocus her efforts from PR stunts to border security negotiations with the president.,2019-01-23 20:32:51,Twitter Web Client,5,14
Although the GOP is making reasonable efforts to fund the government and pay federal employees who are working I can’t in good conscience receive my paycheck at the end of this month. I asked the Chief Administrative Officer to withhold my pay until the shutdown ends. https://t.co/nFlqXRO6DE,2019-01-23 16:29:10,Twitter for iPhone,5,22
A border wall is not some pie-in-the-sky idea -- it's a commonsense solution to security crises. Just look at the numbers and see that border apprehensions plummet after fencing is erected.  @realDonaldTrump is ready to negotiate. I only hope @SpeakerPelosi is ready to listen. https://t.co/8fEBnjYThJ,2019-01-22 19:11:20,Twitter Web Client,193,419
