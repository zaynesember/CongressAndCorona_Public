Trump’s horrendous Safe Third Country Agreement w/ Guatemala is yet another example of his disregard for the safety and well being of asylum seekers coming to the U.S. seeking refuge from dangerous situations.  These policies are putting lives at risk.  https://t.co/xCusQ8ENwG,2020-01-06 18:47:33,Twitter for iPhone,23,37
Trump’s policies are forcing asylum seekers to travel through cartel-controlled territory for their day in immigration court.  His policies are putting women and children seeking asylum at risk of rape abduction and kidnapping.  His #RemainInMexico policy is racist.

I swore an oath to protect the Constitution against anyone who’d erode our democracy.  Sadly we know that person is Donald Trump.  We must #DefendOurDemocracy from him.  This is why we’re moving forward w/ #ArticlesOfImpeachment for his abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. https://t.co/5wrYDknlsS,2019-12-10 15:49:33,Twitter for iPhone,327,1171

What Trump did is unconstitutional.  And if anyone else did this they’d be held accountable.  I urge my GOP colleagues to face this evidence and uphold the oaths each of us took to protect our Constitution.

Your arrogance &amp; disregard for the Constitution is why you’re in the middle of an #impeachment proceeding.  You’re not king &amp; you’re certainly not above the law.

Trump continues to demonstrate that he is not a friend to the #LGBTQ community. This is why we must make the #EqualityAct the law of the land. There is no room for discrimination in America. https://t.co/MoYtdLCBCx,2019-11-02 23:15:54,Twitter for iPhone,1,15

Trump is no friend to the #LGBTQ community.  His administration started National Adoption Month by announcing a new rule that will discriminate against LGBTQ families.
