#TeamChuy said PRESENTE at the Women’s March Chicago 2020! Thousands of women and men of all ages and backgrounds joined together to stand up for women’s rights and human rights. Our favorite sign was: “Feminist I am.”⁣ ⁣#WomensMarch  #MakeItCount ⁣ @womensmarchchi https://t.co/Gwmv0LWhr4,2020-01-19 17:14:53,Twitter for iPhone,4,12
In Matamoros I met an asylum seeker who has been living in a refugee camp since September. As a single mother with no legal representation she’s had to deal with the slow court system all by herself. In a few days she will have her fourth court date. #RemainInMexico ❌ https://t.co/P4iYHRy2ji,2020-01-18 17:15:46,Twitter for iPhone,4,4
Trabajaré duro en el Congreso para revertir la política “permanecer en México”. #RemainInMexico https://t.co/NWHQZR5w2m,2020-01-17 23:14:29,Twitter for iPhone,0,4
Hoy escuché de familias viviendo en casas de campaña y en condiciones insalubres en #Matamoros como resultado de las políticas anti-inmigrantes de Trump. Sus historias te llegan al corazón. Hay muy poca agua comida y cuidado médico disponible. https://t.co/R4rhNVAHNt,2020-01-17 23:13:06,Twitter for iPhone,3,5
I will work as hard as possible in Congress to overturn the #RemainInMexico policy. @ACLUTx  @TXCivilRights https://t.co/BF0fgECsLF,2020-01-17 23:11:41,Twitter for iPhone,1,6
Today I heard from families stuck in unsafe and overcrowded camps in #Matamoros due to Trump’s anti-immigrant policies. Their stories are heartbreaking. Water food and medical care are scarce.   I’m grateful for the groups working on the ground to help people. https://t.co/RLDMrO1w95,2020-01-17 23:09:29,Twitter for iPhone,6,13
The facts are clear: Trump extorted a foreign government to get dirt on a political opponent in exchange for $400M in US support. Congress has done its job. It is time for the Senate to do theirs. https://t.co/F2DqgKOYZN,2020-01-15 01:34:35,Twitter Web App,1,5
Our fellow American brothers and sisters deserve safety and peace of mind. Any little bit helps -  learn more about their campaign and let’s show the world que #PRSeLevanta!  Help #PuertoRico here👇  https://t.co/kgiqMSZpyL,2020-01-12 17:15:30,Twitter for iPhone,1,2
The Puerto Rican Agenda of Chicago is ready to take action and needs your help.   I just donated $5000 to their Rescue Relief Rebuild campaign.,2020-01-12 17:09:41,Twitter for iPhone,1,6
The Trump administration is holding up $18 BILLION approved by Congress for recovery efforts in #PuertoRico. After the recent earthquakes and aftershocks thousands of people have lost their homes and countless don’t have access to water and electricity.,2020-01-12 17:08:44,Twitter for iPhone,8,16

I voted to impeach President Trump. It was a somber vote but it was a necessary one. The President abused his power to bribe Ukraine for his own political gain. My vote was for my constituents the integrity of our elections and to honor my duty of protecting the Constitution. https://t.co/VhLPY01Tg3,2019-12-19 02:55:01,Twitter Web App,24,220

I met with DACA recipients their families and allies to urge the Supreme Court to #ProtectTheDream and uphold the #DACA program. For over 700000 young people America is the only home they have ever known. We should not turn our back on them. #HomeIsHere #HereToStay https://t.co/S6XdefiBsD,2019-11-12 16:26:21,Twitter Web App,7,19
Given Facebook’s bad track record of abusing private data it can’t be trusted with #Libra. That’s why I introduced the Keep Big Tech Out of Finance Act to protect your wallet and keep big tech out of banking.  https://t.co/UTqeZIZe8d,2019-11-06 22:48:34,Twitter Web App,2,3
Congratulations to @CTULocal1 &amp; @SEIU73 for reaching deals w/@ChiPubSchools. The final agreements will improve conditions for teachers and staff &amp; better serve our kids esp.

No one is above the law; not even the president. That’s why I voted to move forward with the impeachment inquiry today.

I met @adybarkan through his work with Local Progress. He’s a tireless advocate for #MedicareForAll despite his health battles. ALS may have taken Ady's ability to speak but not his powerful voice.
