The Trump Administration's proposed rule to weaken the #CRA and make it easier for banks to discriminate is just plain wrong.

What my colleagues and I witnessed today is a human rights crisis of major proportions.

What I saw today is terrible. The Trump Admin should be ashamed of #RemainInMexico and the #TentCourts. There are about 2500 people living in squalor in what used to be a park. They are awaiting their court dates in unsafe and unsanitary conditions. #DemsAtTheBorder https://t.co/0teyxpsVJu,2020-01-17 17:39:51,Twitter for iPhone,39,56
The conditions in the camps are heartbreaking. They get water rationed from a bucket. They see a doctor in what looks like a large portapotty. There are so many children. Before Trump’s #RemainInMexico policy these families could wait in the US for their asylum court dates. https://t.co/FNcpGlF5rM,2020-01-17 16:42:06,Twitter for iPhone,40,39

As a cosponsor of End the Migrant Protection Protocols Act a bill which would end this program I know it has nothing to do with protections and is instead a clear violation of asylum seeker’s rights. https://t.co/em3wNRqzJy,2019-11-26 22:46:12,Twitter for iPhone,4,11

We should all care about safety. If it isn’t getting addressed then we ought to rethink the federal role so safety is a priority. We need to look at data and act accordingly: lower speeds build protected bike lanes walkable streets &amp; better transit alternatives. https://t.co/F2UDGvIvu3,2019-11-06 19:54:41,Twitter Web App,6,28
Driving faster eats more gas drops miles per gallon and emits more NOx. First lower speeds. Second encourage carbon neutral or more sustainable alternatives and invest there instead of bigger wider roads. We also need to reduce total vehicle miles traveled. #SafetyOverSpeed https://t.co/ontorff0FZ,2019-11-06 19:49:04,Twitter Web App,15,69
For too long communities of color seniors &amp; working-class neighborhoods have been overlooked.

@forrespect That is why I have introduced the Reward Work Act and the Stop Wall Street Looting Act to help protect workers from corporate greed.
