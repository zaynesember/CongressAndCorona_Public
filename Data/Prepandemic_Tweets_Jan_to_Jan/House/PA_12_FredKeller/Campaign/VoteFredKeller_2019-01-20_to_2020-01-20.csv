First my opponent called for the Green New Deal and socialized health care now he wants to raise taxes on the middle class!

The Green New Deal would devastate PA-12 agriculture &amp; energy jobs.

We should not implement policies that would put such a burden on the young Americans that are going to be inheriting whatever we do in Washington D.C.

Despite its $93 TRILLION price tag the Green New Deal continues to be the Democrats' top priority.
