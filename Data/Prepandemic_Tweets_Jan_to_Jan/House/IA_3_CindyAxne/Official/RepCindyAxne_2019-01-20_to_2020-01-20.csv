Today I voted with a bipartisan House to restore protections against age discrimination by passing the Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act — which reverses the SCOTUS ruling and ensures future cases treat our older workforce with the respect they deserve. #POWADA,2020-01-15 22:18:45,Twitter Web App,2,19
This is Jack Gross from Des Moines.  In 2009 the Supreme Court ruled against Jack in his age discrimination suit and created an impossibly high bar on age bias —even though @AARP survey shows 3 in 5 older workers have seen such bias.  Today I voted to reverse that ruling. (1/3) https://t.co/gPUXeYUHHe,2020-01-15 22:18:45,Twitter Web App,1,16

It’s bad enough that corporations are leaving American workers high and dry by discreetly shipping jobs overseas.  It’s unacceptable that it can take more than a year for resources to help those workers get back on their feet to be available. (2/2),2020-01-14 18:11:26,Twitter Web App,0,5

We must focus on lowering costs &amp; expanding access to health care not eliminating coverage.  I urge those backing this attempt to strip 1.2 million Iowans living with pre-existing conditions of their health insurance to see the harm this ruling would bring to our state.,2020-01-10 14:35:00,Twitter Web App,2,8

At my town hall this week I asked how many knew someone with a preexisting condition.   Nearly every hand went up.  Ongoing legal attacks threaten Iowans who get coverage thanks to Affordable Care Act protections.

It’s time this Administration lives up to its promise of protecting farmers and rural communities not large oil companies. That’s why tomorrow I plan to call for a federal investigation into the EPA’s questionable biofuel waiver process to hold the agency accountable.,2019-08-20 23:03:26,Twitter Web App,15,53
Iowa farmers have been warning this Administration for months about the devastating impact these waivers are having on our economy. We’re losing Iowa jobs as a direct result of Washington policies.

It is extremely disappointing that not only did the EPA grant 31 out of 37 “small” refinery waivers but the President personally approved these requests. These biofuel waivers are directly hurting Iowa farmers and producers who rely on demand for corn-based ethanol.,2019-08-16 22:40:26,Twitter for iPhone,6,18
When President Trump came to Iowa in June he promised to support Iowa farmers producers and rural communities. Iowans asked specifically for one thing—don’t approve any more unnecessary small refinery waivers. https://t.co/K62eOYR2hk,2019-08-16 22:40:25,Twitter for iPhone,12,42

Members of Congress should be working for their constituents not for themselves or for special interests.
