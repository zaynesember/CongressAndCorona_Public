Pleased U.S. Border Patrol found this stash of deadly fentanyl. I support additional measures to defend our ports of entry. Sadly too much of this junk is mailed into the U.S. and transported across unprotected areas of our southwestern border. https://t.co/qT40tegR4V,2019-01-31 23:49:26,Twitter for iPhone,29,55
The President’s latest proposal to secure America’s borders and re-open the federal government is reasonable. I support his commonsense initiative. It’s time for Speaker Pelosi and the Democrats to compromise. https://t.co/Ww2pXYbmUt,2019-01-20 00:14:48,Twitter for iPhone,12,30
