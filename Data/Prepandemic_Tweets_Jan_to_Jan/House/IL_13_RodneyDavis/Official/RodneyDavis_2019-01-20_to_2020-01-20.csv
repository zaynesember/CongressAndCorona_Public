I’m glad President Trump has agreed to sign a short-term Continuing Resolution so these agencies can re-open and federal workers can be paid. President Trump has put multiple offers on the table and met Democrats more than halfway.,2019-01-25 21:52:42,TweetDeck,7,30
We have an opportunity to get real border security and protect DACA recipients. It’s time to set politics aside and for the Speaker of this House to negotiate a deal with this President.,2019-01-24 22:46:35,TweetDeck,5,16
This week Democrats called us back to Washington to solve this problem. But they’ve voted against paying federal workers 3 times over the past week while Republicans have been standing up for those who have missed paychecks. https://t.co/tdJoFkKctG,2019-01-24 22:46:13,TweetDeck,17,50

@HouseAgGOP I’ve been honored to be part of two successful farm bills and now we must ensure the latest farm bill is implemented and protect the rollback of harmful regulations that we made a priority last Congress.   https://t.co/fDBHsnmNsf,2019-01-24 18:39:46,TweetDeck,4,5

Just voted to immediately pay federal workers while a deal to reopen govt can be reached. As Speaker of the House Pelosi must negotiate a deal w/ President Trump but federal workers shouldn’t be punished while we wait for Democrats to come to the table. https://t.co/XLmpPLMzRM,2019-01-23 22:13:51,TweetDeck,16,39

This compromise proposal from President Trump is almost identical to Democrats' own bill. The BRIDGE Act was written by Senators Graham &amp; Durbin. Let's stop playing politics find a compromise &amp; end this govt shutdown --&gt; https://t.co/HMxDMOhFQQ,2019-01-22 20:36:50,Twitter Web Client,3,12
I support the immigration compromise @POTUS offered Democrats over the weekend because it does three main things: - ends this govt shutdown - provides funding for border security measures experts are asking for - protects DACA recipients &amp; extends Temporary Protected Status,2019-01-22 18:52:00,Twitter Web Client,5,43
