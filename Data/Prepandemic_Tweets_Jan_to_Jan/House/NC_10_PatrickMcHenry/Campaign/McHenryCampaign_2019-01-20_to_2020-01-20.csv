Americans don’t care about President Trump’s tax returns. They want action on tax reform to grow their small businesses and increase their savings. Democrats are fighting a losing battle.    https://t.co/Va721EgYYD,2019-04-09 19:58:00,Sprout Social,0,3

Democrats are advocating for Medicare for All but they do not seem to care that this would put our nation nearly $33 trillion in debt. It’s time to rein in the national budget and secure a financially safe future for our children.  https://t.co/PGH8ZUPgoy,2019-04-02 19:05:00,Sprout Social,0,1
