What an inspiring last three days! Thank you to the @ObamaFoundation for the honor of hosting #MBKRising in Oakland. The work doesn’t stop here — ready to continue the fight for boys and young men of color on Capitol Hill. 💪🏾 https://t.co/1rZ7RwM9rX,2019-02-21 01:15:25,Twitter for iPhone,24,122
After YEARS of Republican inaction my colleagues and I will vote on two commonsense gun bills to expand background checks next week. It's past time to stop talking and start taking a stand. #NotOneMore #EnoughIsEnough #HR8 #HR1112,2019-02-20 21:51:00,TweetDeck,327,1481

34 people are killed by guns everyday in America. 34 fathers mothers sons and daughters every. Single. Day. There are real easy widely supported solutions on the table. Let's get out there and address this head on #HR8 #HR1112 #EndGunViolence,2019-02-20 18:02:01,TweetDeck,96,268

Thank you @RepLucyMcBath @SybrinaFulton and @WANDAJOHNSON27 for sharing your stories of triumph over pain at #MBKRising. We will never stop fighting in your sons’ names to keep our communities safe and protect all our children from senseless gun and police violence. https://t.co/Vtv57SAaqS,2019-02-20 00:44:52,Twitter for iPhone,30,93
Shirley always used to say “If they don’t give you a seat bring a folding chair.” So proud to see more powerful young black women following in her footsteps. #BlackGirlMagic #BYOC #BHM https://t.co/gpqG0NkNoY,2019-02-19 22:11:00,TweetDeck,78,267

Today is the 77th anniversary of Japanese American internment. As we remember those who suffered in internment camps I am outraged by Trump’s cruel policies targeting refugees and immigrants. Americans must stand together against racial prejudice and say: Never Again.,2019-02-19 20:57:00,TweetDeck,692,1955
Congress refused to give Trump funding to build his wasteful wall. Instead of listening he’s declared a #FakeTrumpEmergency. But the American people aren’t buying it – and neither are the 16 states that just filed a lawsuit to stop him. https://t.co/z6M8L5l8iF,2019-02-19 20:23:00,TweetDeck,95,194
Giving back is what it’s all about. Had an amazing time today volunteering at the Day of Service at #MBKRising! https://t.co/2BMEgx3JF6,2019-02-19 03:45:09,Twitter for iPhone,45,251
Happy President’s Day! Today we celebrate presidents who have served the office with dignity shown respect to the constitution and separation of powers and pushed the country to live up to its highest ideals.,2019-02-18 20:05:42,Twitter for iPhone,329,1783

My thoughts are with the people of #Aurora as yet another community in our country deals with senseless tragedy. Gun violence is a national epidemic and it’s taken Congress far too long to address it.,2019-02-15 21:51:21,Twitter for iPhone,82,347
We can’t end the HIV epidemic without addressing stigma. If we truly want to realize our shared goal of achieving an AIDS free generation we need to address discrimination &amp; stigma head on.,2019-02-15 00:22:17,Twitter Web Client,54,217
We've come a long way in treating HIV and AIDS. But a very real stigma still exists in our communities and it hinders critical access to often life-saving care for people living with HIV #HeartofStigma,2019-02-15 00:03:00,TweetDeck,104,417
This #BHM @RepDeSaulnier and I introduced a bill on the #PortChicago50—black service members during WWII who protested unsafe working conditions in the military. These men should be remembered as heroes and receive posthumous pardons for their courage.   https://t.co/3nMOSzcqiM,2019-02-14 22:38:00,TweetDeck,28,79
