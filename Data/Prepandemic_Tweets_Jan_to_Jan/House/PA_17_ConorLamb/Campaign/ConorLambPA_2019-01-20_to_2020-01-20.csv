3. The Pentagon has reportedly conducted 17 war games that China won and the US lost. We cannot accept that.   We have no illusions about who our enemies are. We're asking whether the administration is focused on the right threat at the right time.,2020-01-10 18:40:47,Twitter Web App,19,82
2. This is about the best use of American power. The admin seems to think risking a third long war in the Middle East is in our interest.   I'd recommend they read @eosnos' reporting on how China takes advantage of us when we make decisions like this: https://t.co/ByHr9qnjpm,2020-01-10 18:40:46,Twitter Web App,27,90
1. Our debate this week wasn't about which party supports the military more strongly or whether Soleimani deserved to die.   He did. He was a ruthless enemy of the US &amp; our military proved yet again that our enemies should fear a similar fate at any time.,2020-01-10 18:40:46,Twitter Web App,30,118

.@USChamber is running ads against me because I voted to cut r/x drug prices &amp; expand Medicare to include dental hearing &amp; vision.  I was at Penn Hills Senior Center today. At every table people told me how much they support HR3.  And asked me why the Senate won't vote on it. https://t.co/OJPqCfYL0S,2019-12-31 23:03:15,Twitter Web App,59,284
The @USChamber is mad that I voted to make medicine cheaper. Medicine that keeps a lot of my constituents alive.   We literally wrote the bill to match what the President said he would support.  Hope he keeps his word &amp; ignores these pathetic scare tactics from big Pharma. https://t.co/TGU2aOApbR,2019-12-31 22:26:27,Twitter Web App,38,197
This was one of the first bills I cosponsored when I got to Congress and it was introduced long before I got there.   Today it is officially signed into law.

What President Trump did was wrong. I hoped he would take responsibility &amp; put this incident behind us. But he hasn’t. Instead he insists the call was “perfect” which means he would do it again.  The evidence is clear. The standard is the standard.  I will vote to impeach.,2019-12-16 00:27:06,Twitter for iPhone,2603,14588
President Trump’s job on July 25 — &amp; all other days — was to use the power of his office to oppose the adversaries of the United States. Putin is one of those; Vice President Biden is not. We cannot ever allow an American President to play politics in a theater of war.,2019-12-16 00:27:05,Twitter for iPhone,729,3251
Our national security requires us to resist Russian aggression in all forms. This isn’t controversial &amp; both parties agree.  What happens in Ukraine will determine how this ends. Every inch of ground Putin gains there makes him more likely to attack a NATO ally putting us at war,2019-12-16 00:27:05,Twitter for iPhone,2190,8025
Congratulations to #PA17’s WPIAL 2A &amp; 3A champs Avonworth &amp; Central Valley on fantastic seasons. Tough losses this week in the state championships but you guys &amp; your coaches families &amp; communities have a lot to be proud of.,2019-12-07 20:47:47,Twitter for iPhone,6,65
Good luck to #PA17's undefeated Avonworth HS tomorrow in the state AA championship. I've had the chance to see the Antelopes play the past two years in the annual Gold Star Family game in honor of fallen servicemembers. Great team &amp; program.

Here we go again. A dark money PAC just dropped $200K on attack ads against us one year ahead of the 2020 election.   We've been here before. Together we took on big money twice last year.

As we look back on 30 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall and the triumph of America’s bipartisan policy of opposing Russian aggression it is extra special to wish Happy Birthday to the “first to fight for right and freedom” the United States Marines. #MarineCorpsBirthday,2019-11-10 16:03:30,Twitter for iPhone,26,162

Please keep Pittsburgh in your prayers today 1 year after the #TreeofLife shooting.  None of us will ever forget the sadness of that day or the 11 lives we lost.

Gen. Mattis used to say there's "no better friend no worse enemy" than a US Marine.  How can anyone in the world consider us to be "no better friend" if we cut &amp; run?  This is wrong &amp; it's urgent. We have the power to stop this &amp; we need to do it now. https://t.co/ZqozbFxHp2,2019-10-09 22:46:21,Twitter Web App,169,595

If this whistleblower was in Russia they'd probably be dead or in prison right now.   In the United States their identity is protected &amp; their evidence has reached a separate branch of government than the one in which they serve.  That's what sets us apart. https://t.co/oaJR4zeTYa,2019-09-28 01:13:31,Twitter Web App,292,1689
I think we can all take some pride this week in seeing that our system can still work.  A person came forward following the law to report a potential national security threat. They are protected &amp; we got the facts.  That doesn't happen in Russia.   This is what makes us better. https://t.co/oaJR4zeTYa,2019-09-28 00:55:18,Twitter Web App,382,2664

For more than 2 years a lot of people in #NC09 have been working hard to elect @McCreadyForNC.   They faced big odds &amp; big money. They had one election stolen.

UNION. https://t.co/nRY4PQA5dn,2019-09-02 23:28:07,Twitter for iPhone,30,348
SCOTUS said that J&amp;L’s union-busting was a “proper subject for condemnation by competent legislative authority.”  When this Congress unequivocally supports union rights &amp; condemns union-busting we’ll be closer to calling ourselves a “competent legislative authority.” #LaborDay,2019-09-02 23:12:34,Twitter for iPhone,11,59
There’s a plaque in Aliquippa #PA17 marking NLRB v J&amp;L Steel when SCOTUS affirmed workers’ rights to organize &amp; bargain collectively.

The House passed #HR8 &amp; #HR1112 this year to help prevent these tragedies going forward.   Both bills comply with the Second Amendment &amp; they deserve a vote in the US Senate — regardless of how far the President backtracks on his promise for common-sense reform. #DoSomething,2019-08-21 16:02:08,Twitter Web App,24,99
The President is wrong: Our background check system is not good enough.   Dylann Roof was 1 of thousands every year who slip through the cracks &amp; buy guns illegally. If the FBI had more than 3 days to check his background his victims might still be alive. https://t.co/Vgh2vnUf0w,2019-08-21 16:02:08,Twitter Web App,29,132

Making our government work well again has to start at the top. These comments have no place in our national debate over any issue. The President should lead by example and he can start by apologizing. (4/4),2019-07-15 21:04:24,Twitter Web Client,11,47
I don’t think he would make the same comment to all of the immigrants and people of color serving in uniform today. (3/4),2019-07-15 21:04:07,Twitter Web Client,5,28
What the President said was shameful. He’s supposed to be the leader of all Americans but those comments go directly against our most fundamental ideal — that out of many we can be one. (2/4),2019-07-15 21:03:55,Twitter Web Client,5,29

Too many #PA17 high school basketball teams in the #WPIAL Championships this weekend to fit in one tweet. Congrats &amp; good luck to the girls at North Allegheny Char Valley Central Valley North Catholic Shady Side Academy OLSH &amp; Rochester.,2019-02-28 18:04:27,Twitter Web Client,6,117
Thinking of my friend @RepDebDingell today as she lays her husband @JohnDingell to rest at Arlington National Cemetery. A WWII veteran a fierce defender of organized labor a legendary public servant who will never be forgotten.,2019-02-15 18:48:27,Twitter for iPhone,43,526
The victims of Parkland &amp; all victims of gun violence deserve action. This Congress has an opportunity to finally take real meaningful action to prevent gun violence — starting with #HR8 a bipartisan bill to require universal background checks. Let’s get it done.,2019-02-14 18:09:12,Twitter for iPhone,78,473
The first time I introduced a motion on the Floor — to protect funding for the VA &amp; its patients &amp; workers — one Republican crossed party lines to vote for it: Rep. Walter Jones. A true gentleman who loved veterans loved the Marine Corps &amp; loved public service. Rest in peace.,2019-02-11 16:07:24,Twitter Web Client,82,798
Congrats to Aliquippa's @OfficialTyLaw on his selection to the NFL #HOF. Good luck to Penn Hills alum &amp; back-to-back NFL Defensive Player of the Year @AaronDonald97 in the Super Bowl.   From pretty much everyone in #PA17 please beat the Patriots (no offense to Ty Law). https://t.co/2iAaLTfFFz,2019-02-03 20:29:33,Twitter Web Client,15,143

Joined @AohAllegheny Division 32 this morning at the National Cemetery of the Alleghenies to pick up wreaths from @WreathsAcross. Thanks to everyone at @VANatCemeteries for the great work you do maintaining this sacred place. https://t.co/1OrBntBJj3,2019-01-26 21:31:51,Twitter Web Client,16,120
This shutdown was entirely avoidable. This is the same bipartisan solution we reached more than a month ago. 800K+ American workers have been suffering for absolutely no reason.   Thank you to those who were willing to cross party lines. Let's keep that going in the weeks ahead.,2019-01-25 19:50:17,Twitter Web Client,254,1524
6 GOP senators voted w/ Dems to reopen the govt &amp; pay our people. We already have a bipartisan solution to this crisis. Senate ldrsp must join others unafraid to cross party lines for the good of the country.  Sinful that anyone will miss a paycheck tomorrow for work they've done,2019-01-25 00:53:05,Twitter Web Client,265,1684
Senate Republicans will finally vote on whether to reopen the government.  RT to tell them to become part of the bipartisan solution join several House Republicans &amp; all Democrats &amp; end this injustice.  The public servants protecting us must be paid this Friday. #EndTheShutdown,2019-01-23 18:14:12,Twitter Web Client,318,544
A lot of great local events celebrating Dr. King's legacy including Beaver #MLKDay Banquet MLK Prayer Breakfast at Ebenezer Baptist Church @NorthHillsARC MLK Breakfast &amp; Midland MLK Celebration. Grateful to have so many people in #PA17 committed to making his dream a reality. https://t.co/d7z615Rcf7,2019-01-21 22:18:13,Twitter Web Client,14,131
