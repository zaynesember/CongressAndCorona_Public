I’m worried that the legal age of adulthood will keep rising for all endeavors and I’m concerned about what it means for 18 year old adults who choose not to go to college.

Creating a “not quite an adult so can’t do adult things or have adult jobs” gap between the ages of 18 and 21 is contributing to drug addiction.

@iainmclaren @glennbeck 99%+ of our electricity is solar. (The remaining fraction is from a propane backup generator which is very infrequently needed.)

That’s awesome @glennbeck ! Snow is a real factor when you’re off the grid and using solar.

In addition to the obvious benefits of reducing distractions for legislators and temporally decoupling the inherent conflicts of interest it balances the playing field for challengers since non-incumbents aren’t bound by the same fund raising blackout periods as the incumbents.,2019-11-11 18:39:58,Twitter for iPhone,20,133
A great reform idea for US Congress that comes from the states:  Some state legislatures like Ky prohibit fundraising while the legislature is in session.

@miriwood The vehicle they used is a “joint resolution” which is different from a “resolution.” If a joint resolution is also passed by the senate and signed by President it would be binding and have the effect of a law.

Why are they not asking for a Declaration of War? @realDonaldTrump  is correct!   If folks want us in a war then call members of Congress and ask for a declaration of war.

@sanj_2002 @ReasonPitchbot It’s debatable whether the People’s House has the right to foolishly give power vested in them to the POTUS.

@ReasonPitchbot We haven’t had a vote on tariffs since I’ve been in Congress.

@ajayzmd @OKIRCOG @Kris_Knochelman @TCCommissioner I’m not for sending more troops overseas and we have too many overseas bases.

In 2015 Obama ignored the Constitution (and his own words 2 years before) and began sending troops to Syria without Congressional authorization. Eventually more troops followed. https://t.co/GSevpBFz96,2019-10-11 04:23:31,Twitter for iPhone,166,475
According to articles printed later Obama and Congress ramped up a secret war consisting primarily of funneling equipment to insurgents in Syria. Some of this ended up in the hands of Al Qaeda and what became ISIS.  https://t.co/slgrrpIWx5,2019-10-11 04:23:28,Twitter for iPhone,172,447
Congress waffled and the vote never happened.

There he goes again being honest about the Democrats’ intentions.

Many in the media have exaggerated the power of the AR15 cartridge compared to other common calibers. The most notable characteristic of the AR15 round is its small size. Banning the AR15 over handguns or deer rifles due to the power of the cartridge the AR15 uses is illogical. https://t.co/FX8x2vQEds,2019-09-16 23:28:45,Twitter for iPhone,499,1710
