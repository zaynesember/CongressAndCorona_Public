Received new polling info at a meeting at Camp David. It supports my theory that proceeding with impeachment backfires on democrats in the 2020 election-- particularly in swing districts.

Somehow those of us in a leadership role must forge enough of a constructive relationship such that the work of the people is priority not spiteful acrimony. I work on this every day and committed to doing so as long as I serve.,2019-11-21 21:13:46,Twitter for iPhone,3,22
The argument can be made that there is more adversarial conflict in Washington DC today than at any time since the American civil war.,2019-11-21 21:13:45,Twitter for iPhone,3,20
The fact that President Trump knew about it makes him culpable. It is entirely possible that if he didn’t bring it forward we could be sitting through an impeachment hearing for another reason; to impeach the President because he was aware of the crime yet did nothing about it.,2019-11-21 21:13:45,Twitter for iPhone,6,26
As a result of the impeachment hearings it is clear that while serving as VP Joe Biden leveraged his position such that his son Hunter would be rewarded with substantial fiscal gain. Comparatively this story has yielded underwhelming attention but it has little dispute.,2019-11-21 21:13:45,Twitter for iPhone,4,11
At this point their political investment is so great that to do anything less would sacrifice pride reputation &amp; political position. Such timing is now estimated to extend into January; because impeachment is in search of a crime &amp; more time is needed to find a crime.,2019-11-21 21:13:45,Twitter for iPhone,1,10
No democrat present in the hearing changed their view due to Mr. Sondland’s testimony. No republican changed their view. These proceedings are pre-programmed to result in impeachment of President Trump. The democrats are in the majority &amp; they must impeach. They have no choice.,2019-11-21 21:13:44,Twitter for iPhone,4,14
With that… Please accept this commentary from a member of congress that is a conservative native Idahoan; and one that I believe reflects the viewpoint of a majority of citizens in Idaho’s 1st congressional district:,2019-11-21 21:13:44,Twitter for iPhone,0,11
However a short time later when Ambassador Sondland confirmed during cross examination that his testimony had changed and that the President had in fact stated: “…I want nothing I want no quid pro quo”… media response was subdued.  My phone was silent.,2019-11-21 21:13:44,Twitter for iPhone,1,12
In a frenzy keyboards tapped. Cameras clicked. Some reporters hastened out of the room presumably to relay to the public “bombshell” information. Even my own cell phone signaled their reports.,2019-11-21 21:13:44,Twitter for iPhone,0,9
Initial testimony from Sondland captured attention when he said he “presumed” there was “quid pro quo” insinuating the President put the contingency of a Biden investigation on Ukranian aid. At that point a sort of “exhilaration” appeared to engulf many of our media friends.,2019-11-21 21:13:44,Twitter for iPhone,0,8
I spent some time personally witnessing yesterday’s impeachment hearing. Here are some observations:   What made the hearing interesting was not what happened “in” the hearing but rather what happened “around” it.,2019-11-21 21:13:43,Twitter for iPhone,6,26

Chairman Schiff’s democrat committee members agree with witnesses Mr. Taylor and Mr. Kent as they cite how critical it is to respect and defend the Ukrainian borders. However there is no evidence during this Congress that they share the same concern about American borders.,2019-11-14 18:18:53,Twitter Web App,68,267
Democrats also concerned that POTUS wanted to investigate Burisma Holdings. However Dems not concerned w/ Biden threatening (video: https://t.co/h41anmeAI7) to stop $1 billion to Ukraine unless they fired the prosecutor investigating Burisma who was paying his son $50000/month.,2019-11-14 18:18:53,Twitter Web App,74,241
Democrats had concerns w/ U.S. not providing enough aid to Ukraine. After the Crimea invasion (Under Obama) mostly non-lethal aid was provided to the Ukrainians. In contrast Trump increased Ukraine’s security by allowing lethal deterrence weapons like Javelin missiles.,2019-11-14 18:18:53,Twitter Web App,66,216
During the hearing Schiff also stopped a republican member from speaking when he feared the whistleblower’s identity was about to be divulged.,2019-11-14 18:18:52,Twitter Web App,57,213
Schiff stated for the record that he did not know the identity of the whistleblower.  Schiff also previously claimed “We have not spoken directly with the whistleblower” and this was found to be false; the whistleblower reached out to Schiff’s staff before filing their complaint.,2019-11-14 18:18:52,Twitter Web App,68,256
The whistleblower approached authorities without asking to have legal “whistleblower” protection. However IG Horowitz identified the whistleblower as having bias in favor of Joe Biden &amp; somehow legal whistleblower protections were invoked through Chairman Schiff’s committee.,2019-11-14 18:18:52,Twitter Web App,69,245
Mr. Taylor testified that he believed the President’s actions threatened U.S. Foreign Policy. However Mr. Taylor did not acknowledge that the President has the right to set foreign policy and when asked neither Mr. Taylor nor Mr. Kent could identify any laws breached.,2019-11-14 18:18:52,Twitter Web App,71,273
Mr. Taylor said his staffer heard POTUS say something to the effect of "he was more interested in the Burisma-Biden connection.” However it turns out this is a retelling from a staffer who recalls overhearing EU Ambassador Sondland in a restaurant talking to POTUS on his phone..,2019-11-14 18:18:51,Twitter Web App,59,249
The 2 witnesses did not listen in on the phone call. Instead they each heard from someone who heard from someone else who listened to the phone call. In today’s hearing they're considered expert witnesses w/ pertinent info.   However in Idaho it’s better known as gossip.,2019-11-14 18:18:51,Twitter Web App,89,344

I've had a few q's regarding my vote against H.R. 676 (NATO Support Act by Rep. Panetta D-CA) &amp; I would like to explain my vote. First I am not anti-NATO.
