You have been misled by Socialist Dems &amp; Fake News Media.  GAO report says civil matter not criminal.

18 of my conservative colleagues &amp; I sent a letter to AG Barr yesterday urging him to work with others in the Administration to add the citizenship question to the 2020 Census.

Faith-based groups are among the most adept at providing assistance to abuse victims. #VAWA2019 opens the door to lawsuits against faith-based groups that accept VAWA grant money and hire men as men and women as women in accord with their firmly-held religious beliefs.,2019-04-04 15:22:03,Twitter Web Client,1,5

ObamaCare severely restricts healthcare choices. @Heritage analysts found that in 2015 64 insurers entered the market and nine exited. In 2017 only 10 insurers entered the market and 80 exited.,2019-04-02 20:34:07,Twitter Web Client,3,9
