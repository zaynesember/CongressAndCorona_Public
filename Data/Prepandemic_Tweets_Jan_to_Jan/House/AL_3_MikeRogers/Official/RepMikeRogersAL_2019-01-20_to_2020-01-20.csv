He's spent yrs lying to the American ppl abt President Trump all in a secret effort to try &amp; undo the 2016 election.  It's ridiculous that House Democrats couldn’t even be bothered to hold an up or down vote on this resolution &amp; instead resorted to procedural tricks to block it.,2019-10-21 23:05:57,Twitter Web App,60,96
made up his own version of the conversation between President Trump and Ukrainian President Zelensky and read it at a hearing as if it was real and was completely dishonest about his committee’s contact with the so-called whistleblower.,2019-10-21 23:05:55,Twitter Web App,44,75
Tonight Speaker Pelosi blocked House Republicans from bringing H. Res. 630 a resolution condemning and censuring Adam Schiff.  Congressman Schiff Chairman of the Intelligence Committee has lied repeatedly about Russian collusion,2019-10-21 23:05:54,Twitter Web App,394,718
These behind closed door meetings should be open to Members of Congress &amp; the American people.
