Punishing the poor does not create a safer environment. Instead it threatens the very foundation of our community. That is why my New York colleagues and I wrote a letter to @NYGovCuomo asking him to help put an end to MTA's dangerous policing policy.

“It’s our job to redefine the rules of society and to treat people who give birth with the dignity they deserve.”  That’s why I’m fighting for three months of paid family leave in the United States. https://t.co/QzpKSYoF6o,2019-12-10 22:24:41,Twitter Media Studio,345,2084
I agree. This is not the time for half-measures. Half-measures threaten the fate of our planet and the future of our kids and grandchildren. The Green New Deal for Public Housing Act is not radical.

The issue of housing is the perfect place for us to reimagine what a progressive economic agenda can do particularly with a Green New Deal context.

A Green New Deal for public housing means hundreds of thousands of jobs. 👷‍♀️👷🏽‍♂️🛠  Our bill shows that the climate crisis is not about jobs vs. the environment. We need electrical workers.
