Trump’s NAFTA 2.0 is an enormous multinational prize for climate deniers and the fossil fuel industry.

Thank you @SenSchumer.

@PreetBharara Usual markup debate rules mean that each amendment can only be debated for 10 minutes (5 for &amp; against).  “Strike the last word” is the magic spell to talk beyond that.

Yes! And equal paternity/parental leave is just as critical.  Non-birthing parents are JUST as important.We have to end the stigma that only birthing parents should take time off.

Puppies aren’t separated from their moms until ~8 weeks. Less than that is thought of as harmful or abusive.  One of the most common lengths of US paid family leave is ~6 weeks.

Or let’s talk about food stamps and cars!  This is one of the wildest rules to me.

If you have severe depression (or any number of mental issues) everyday life is very difficult. But it’s really hard to get disability status in general for mental health issues.

The rule ignores the reality of American life.  Plenty of parents who support can’t claim “adult” (18+) children as dependents.

My family relied on food stamps (EBT) when my dad died at 48.  I was a student. If this happened then we might’ve just starved.  Now many people will.

A combined household income of $100k isn’t even “children of millionaires” territory.  That’s two parents making $50k/each. Does that sound rich to you?   It’s not. It’s a working family.

Look out for those in politics who like to label themselves “fiscally responsible” yet only seem to care about the price of justice - not the cost of oppression.  Everything has a price.

None of the politicians who brand themselves “fiscally responsible” ever raise concern about rushing to shower ICE &amp; CBP w/ $billions with 0 guardrails or oversight.

None of this is a critique on lawmakers who dial for dollars - they don’t want to be doing it in the first place.

Our political system’s reliance on huge sums of money has many negative impacts but one of the largest is that it takes lawmakers’ time away from lawmaking.

There is of course much more time for me to be fully present at my job.   In Congress this is a luxury.

Rep. Mooney you &amp; I both know that when a massive crime is committed the 1st step is to separate witnesses &amp; get their stories to see what adds up.

Hey @NRA why don’t you release my full unedited interview?  You know the one where my first answer to your question was “Aren’t y’all broke?”  I think the public would like to see it in full.

Also - what they are calling a “transcript” isn’t even a transcript. It’s a collection of notes. This is what they are *admitting* to and it’s way above and beyond what is necessary for impeachment.

"I would like you to do us a favor...”  Folks I am surprised the White House even released this transcript. It’s worse than we thought.

Domestic abusers can be master manipulators. Plus domestic abuse is a HUGE indicator for gun violence.  That’s why “vouching for friend” isn’t a substitute for a background check.  You wouldn’t lend a car to someone w/o a license.Why lend a gun to someone w/o a background check?,2019-09-04 17:26:48,Twitter for iPhone,4286,34349
Rapists can have Ivy League degrees. Abusers can look like “good dads” or have high incomes or “great jobs.”  Good appearances are often a cover for abusers. In fact many abusers RELY on their public reputation to intimidate partners from leaving (ex: “no one will believe you.”),2019-09-04 17:19:29,Twitter for iPhone,5306,38928
This idea of “I know the guy there’s no way he beats his wife” as the way we keep guns out of the hands of abusers is ridiculous.  Any person who has been abused assaulted etc knows that abusers often present as “upstanding.”  There’s no way you’d know. That’s why it’s common. https://t.co/uuq17HT3Of,2019-09-04 17:13:16,Twitter for iPhone,12071,75806
Herein lies an important point abt domestic abuse: most of it is hidden. You could know an abuser &amp; have no clue.  I’ve had friends come out to me as victims. It’s not obvious.

You said w/ universal background checks you wouldn’t be able to “lend” guns to friends.  If a background check would be a problem then you shouldn’t “lend” a gun.  And btw NY is one of the safest states in the country when it comes to guns incl rural areas.  Try to keep up. https://t.co/4RV4DNg7FM,2019-09-04 16:52:10,Twitter for iPhone,6470,52466
You are a member of Congress. Why are you “lending” guns to people unsupervised who can’t pass a basic background check?

Beyond the moral wrong racism is a powerful political tool used to dismantle public goods &amp; civil rights.  So long as bigoted sympathies exist (subtly or loud) they will be used.

The corruption of Trump - of many admins - wouldn’t be politically possible without relying on sympathy for racist policies.  That’s what Reagan’s Black “welfare queen” was all about too.

Since corruption isn’t popular policy racism works as the cover for the con. That’s why addressing racism isn’t a “distraction” - it’s key to understanding the hustle against working people.   Culturally racism is used as the unspoken cudgel against pro-working class policy. /2,2019-09-03 15:48:10,Twitter for iPhone,1295,7182

If people were actually concerned about undocumented people the clear solution would be to offer documentation. It’s safer &amp; secure for everyone.

About 1/2 of all the cases I see at work are immigration related. Many are people who‘ve been on the path to citizenship for years.  Steps that are supposed to be ~30 days are taking up to a year.

Today I was asked why we should bother paying interns if they’re “getting experience for their résumé.”  Here’s what we have say about that: https://t.co/vbHoMTLDI3,2019-07-25 19:00:44,Twitter for iPhone,63634,265701
The notion of dismantling ICE is nowhere near as radical as the destructive 2003 decision to establish ICE - an extrajudicial enforcement agency that controls a  black-box network of for-profit detention centers accountable to no one even when people die - in the first place. https://t.co/IkSADMZ4K5,2019-07-25 17:35:46,Twitter for iPhone,13471,45715

I’ve waited tables and interviewed on live TV.  He’s right. Going on TV can be stressful but restaurant shifts are much much harder.  Most of these Fox News correspondents couldn’t last one real day in these hard working jobs they love to mock on television. https://t.co/36zN0Aeljo,2019-07-25 02:40:31,Twitter for iPhone,12043,79970

The rule of law means *everyone* should be treated the same in the eyes of the law.  That means the rich &amp; powerful should be held accountable for crimes as anyone else.  That includes the President.  He broke the law. And to maintain American rule of law he must be impeached. https://t.co/9YZga1JEB4,2019-07-24 15:35:41,Twitter for iPhone,32811,131431
The climate crisis will not wait for the comfort of politicians.  The consequences of a burning planet are coming and the situation we leave our children will be proportionate to the courage (or lack thereof) we show now.  Greta‘s right. Unite behind the science - not lobbyists. https://t.co/O2r0kdRXAV,2019-07-23 21:43:18,Twitter for iPhone,18599,74641
