The peaceful demonstrators in Hong Kong are modern heroes in humanity’s time worn struggle for liberty and an inspiration to freedom seekers everywhere.  #utpol https://t.co/5aw8hwZmT7,2019-08-18 14:23:54,Twitter for iPhone,14,76
#HongKong demonstrations against repression censorship and erosion of individual and religious liberties by China and the Chinese Communist Party have captured the world’s attention. Military intervention by Beijing is the wrong way to resolve civil disagreement. #utpol,2019-08-18 14:23:53,Twitter for iPhone,9,69

@J0EBL0W @TomForUtah @Patbagley @USATODAY I don’t support family separation and have spoken out and voted to end it.
