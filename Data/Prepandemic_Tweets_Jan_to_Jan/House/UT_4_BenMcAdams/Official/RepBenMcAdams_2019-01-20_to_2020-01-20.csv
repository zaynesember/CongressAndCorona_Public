If you care about health care and climate change and building a 21st Century infrastructure system and affordable housing and any other investment the government can make—then I urge you – care about the debt and deficits. #utpol,2019-07-18 18:47:57,Twitter Web Client,3,19
I care about debt &amp; deficits because a strong fiscal house means we have a stronger country that $383 billion spent on interest payments on our debt is $383 billion we can’t spend on other priorities such as clean energy and transportation and affordable health care. #utpol,2019-07-18 18:46:53,Twitter Web Client,2,15

As we’ve done more than 100 times we are preparing to vote to raise the debt limit. Raising it does not authorize new spending; it enables the government to pay its bills. What better time to pair that vote with a plan to reform our government spending? #utpol,2019-07-18 18:42:29,Twitter Web Client,2,3
We know that the costs of barreling towards this fiscal cliff are already mounting. American taxpayers foot the bill for additional borrowing costs that come from delays in extending the debt limit. #utpol,2019-07-18 18:41:27,Twitter Web Client,0,3

Rep. Omar's comment is not only hurtful and divisive it is anti-Semitic and simply wrong on the facts.

@darinhorrocks No. If a budget is not passed on time the bill makes it so the govt will continue operating under an automatic concurrent resolution. It will also stop all congressional salaries and travel funding and prohibits some White House and cabinet member funding during that time.,2019-01-30 18:03:47,Twitter for iPhone,0,1

@HumanFlyer @SenMikeLee I know right! Weird. I’m still looking for the other Democrats in the Utah delegation so we can take a picture.
