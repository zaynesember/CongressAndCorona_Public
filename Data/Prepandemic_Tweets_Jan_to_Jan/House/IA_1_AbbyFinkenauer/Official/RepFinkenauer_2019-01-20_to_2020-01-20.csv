I am appalled by Rep. Steve King’s cruel comments &amp; his blatant disrespect for sexual assault survivors.

President Trump came to Iowa looked my friends and neighbors in the eye and promised them he would protect the Renewable Fuel Standard. He gave them his word and that should have meant something. 1/4,2019-08-09 23:38:58,Twitter for iPhone,15,54

I hear it across #ia01 &amp; now the there’s a poll to prove it! Iowans want to stay in Iowa. That’s why I’m working for investments in infrastructure housing &amp; trade schools to keep hardworking Iowans here &amp; create opportunity for friends kids &amp; grandkids to come back home. 👷‍♀️ https://t.co/9Oj050H2uv,2019-02-25 01:43:16,Twitter Web App,10,58

(2/2) I urge my Senate colleagues to put country and Iowa over party and call out this Administration's reckless games. This chaos and dysfunction are now risking funds that #IA01 is counting on for the CR flood wall. I'll fight every day to not let that happen.,2019-02-15 19:27:20,Twitter Web Client,14,79
(1/2)We need to keep our borders secure &amp; our government running. That’s why Congress came together &amp; passed a bipartisan spending bill. Declaring a national emergency defying our constitution taking billions of unauthorized taxpayer dollars ignores important checks &amp; balances.,2019-02-15 19:06:04,Twitter Web App,29,155

Proud to join roll out of the #FAMILYAct. Iowans deserve more than talking points they deserve legislation that reflects the values we grew up with.
