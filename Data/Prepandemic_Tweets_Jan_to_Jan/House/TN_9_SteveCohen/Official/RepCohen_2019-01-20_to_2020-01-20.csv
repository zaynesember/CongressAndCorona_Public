@HouseJudiciary This critical bill works to right the wrongs of the failed and racist War on Drugs by expunging criminal convictions reinvesting in communities of color decriminalizing #marijuana &amp; promoting equitable participation in the cannabis industry. #WeWantMore,2019-11-20 20:34:19,Twitter Web App,19,42
The idea that Congress is rushing reform on #marijuana is ludicrous. We are far behind. Marijuana has been improperly &amp; illogically categorized as a schedule 1 drug for decades.

More than 650K people are arrested for marijuana offenses every year. The failed War on Drugs is a stain on our country and we must work to undo the damage it caused.

In an #ImpeachmentInvestigation you collect all the evidence &amp; then you decide if should recommend articles of #impeachment. That’s what @HouseJudiciary is doing. We’ve heard from Mueller.

Robert Mueller made it clear that if DOJ policy hadn’t prevented him from indicting a sitting president Trump would have been charged with #obstruction of justice.

Trump wanted Sessions to act as his consigliere not as the Attorney General of the United States. Trump wanted Sessions to hinder the investigation &amp; shield him from Mueller. This is obstruction of justice. This is criminal behavior. #MuellerTestimony #CultureOfCorruption,2019-07-24 18:45:13,Twitter Web App,65,168
Jeff Sessions recused himself from the Special Counsel Investigation b/c of his role on the Trump campaign.

When Trump learned that Robert Mueller had been made Special Counsel he said “Oh my God. This is terrible. This is the end of my Presidency.

Centuries of discrimination have led to a racial wealth gap that continues to disproportionately affect African Americans.

Ta-Nehisi Coats’s testimony before @HouseJudiciary is a powerful rebuttal to @senatemajldr McConnell’s argument that there is no need to pursue #reparations.
