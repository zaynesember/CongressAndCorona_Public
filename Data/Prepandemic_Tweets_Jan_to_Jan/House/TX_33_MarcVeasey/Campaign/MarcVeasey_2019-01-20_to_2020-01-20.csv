Anytime a Republican gets a tough question they fall on the calling someone a “liberal” crutch and pretend as if they are being victimized. That’s you #McSally https://t.co/4wIK94pJDt,2020-01-16 18:42:07,Twitter for iPhone,5,10
.@JoeBiden's record of helping the African-American community goes unmatched — that is why he is performing so well with black voters across our country and back here in Texas. #2020Election,2020-01-13 16:33:12,Twitter for Android,47,130

The serious question is does McCarthy have real control. If the “GM” is still calling the shots then it’s (McCarthy hiring)all for naught. And many more seasons of misery for long time fans. #FrFR https://t.co/WS2sSrp0ub,2020-01-06 17:17:02,Twitter for iPhone,2,1

There is NOTHING noble about falsely characterizing all immigrants as criminals. In fact research finds that immigrants are less likely to be incarcerated than their native-born peers. The sheriff is simply trying to divide our diverse NTX community. https://t.co/9rRpsV5Xfc,2019-10-11 01:13:16,Twitter for Android,2,9
