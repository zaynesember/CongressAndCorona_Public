While we were visiting news also broke that thousands of Border Agents were part of a secret Facebook group where members regularly posted offensive racist and sexist comments about the migrants in their custody as well as members of Congress. (4/5),2019-07-01 22:52:12,Twitter Web Client,415,892
Nevertheless we found children barely older than toddlers in cells; families that had been separated from one another; holding centers that were little more than animal sheds with chainlink fences and pad-locks used to lock up men women and children.

First of all I know that what we saw as members of Congress on a scheduled visit planned in advance must be far from the worst conditions faced by migrants in Border Patrol custody. (2/5),2019-07-01 22:52:11,Twitter Web Client,390,980

Today I sent a letter to @AjitPaiFCC to urge him to not implement a cap on Universal Service Fund Programs. This is an attack on low-income households across the country but particularly those in rural America.

During Whitley’s tenure the voting rights of tens of thousands of Texans were on the line. His resignation is long overdue.

The GOP created an undue burden on #GoldStar families w/ a tax provision that passed in the Trump’s tax scam creating huge unexpected tax hikes for servicemember families.

The threat facing #Dreamers #TPS and #DED holders is a crisis created by the Trump Admin. #HR6 will shield these communities from deportation and keep families together.

Texas Dems contributed to #SB9 being struck down in the House today.

Devastated to hear Muhlaysia a 23-year-old transgender woman in Dallas has been fatally shot. Earlier this year she faced an attack on her own life.

SB9 is a GOP-backed bill in the Texas legislature designed to discriminate against minority citizens &amp; new voters. It would create criminal penalties for minor typos on voter registration forms. Let's call it what it is – straight-up voter suppression. https://t.co/zgGZJm2roG,2019-05-17 21:53:02,Twitter Web Client,5,9

Nearly 20% skip medical doses because of high prescription costs. That’s 1 in 5 Americans.

What year are we in? GOP in AL voted to punish women. That’s what this vote represented punishing women for exercising the right #RoevWade grants them to get an abortion.
