My parents always modeled participation in volunteerism and government.  When I was a child my mom once took me with her to vote -- but it became a scene when I found out I wasn't going to be allowed to vote myself. I cared!  The poll workers even tried giving me a sample ballot! https://t.co/P0GJmjrZQO,2019-02-22 19:46:10,Twitter Web Client,5,150
