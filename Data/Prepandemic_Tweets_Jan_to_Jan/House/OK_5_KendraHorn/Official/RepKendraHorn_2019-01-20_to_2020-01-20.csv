Yesterday I had the great honor of hosting a Civil Rights &amp; Justice Town Hall with advocates from our community working toward equity &amp; justice. Thank you to all who joined us to start the MLK Weekend by discussing the past present &amp; future of the fight for civil rights. https://t.co/mK5wFCJnhU,2020-01-19 14:14:13,Twitter for iPhone,15,108
Great to be at @kfor &amp; @KOCOnews this morning to talk about our Civil Rights &amp; Justice Town Hall tomorrow at Fairview Baptist Church from 1-3pm. We invite you to join us for a discussion on OKC’s proud history in the fight for civil rights &amp; talk about the work being done today. https://t.co/PsWgiclBYT,2020-01-17 16:25:48,Twitter for iPhone,15,66
As we approach MLK Day it's critical we pause to acknowledge those who fought &amp; continue to fight for justice.

Great news! The Senate just passed the bipartisan USMCA trade deal! Stronger trading relationships with our neighbors mean a stronger economy for OK workers businesses and families. Today’s win is another example of what we can accomplish when both parties work together.,2020-01-16 18:00:10,Twitter for iPhone,10,77
Americans hold $1.6 trillion in student debt. We still need action to reduce the cost of higher ed and we must tackle the student debt crisis. Today’s bill is a first step to help students defrauded by for-profit colleges and to hold predatory institutions accountable.,2020-01-16 16:33:33,Twitter for iPhone,4,79
For too long predatory colleges have cheated U.S. students. Now Devos is proposing a rule making it harder for students to seek relief. Today the House took action to stop that rule from going into effect.,2020-01-16 16:33:32,Twitter for iPhone,5,85
Never before has there been a Secretary of Education who cares so little for our students. Betsy Devos has actively worked to block student debt relief measures for those defrauded by for-profit colleges. Today the House is taking action to protect students from Devos’ policies.,2020-01-16 16:33:32,Twitter for iPhone,75,535
Many harmful tariffs are still in place. It’s going to take time to recover from the trade war of the past two years. Trade decisions should be focused on providing certainty and promoting economic competitiveness not partisan politics.,2020-01-15 23:29:25,Twitter for iPhone,3,17
I am cautiously optimistic that the #PhaseOne trade deal represents a step forward for the OK businesses and consumers hurt by the trade war. For too long China cheated US companies with unfair practices like forced tech transfers. This is a first step towards free &amp; fair trade.,2020-01-15 23:29:25,Twitter for iPhone,4,39
Today I introduced legislation to rename the downtown post office as the Clara Luper Post Office. The historic sit-ins led by Luper and the NAACP Youth Council changed Oklahoma and inspired desegregation actions across the South. We must remember and celebrate our proud history. https://t.co/6BhBLeu0n9,2020-01-14 21:54:21,Twitter for iPhone,72,441
As the Congresswoman representing #OK5 I'm proud to be a voice for all Oklahomans. That means listening to people's concerns and taking action on issues important to our state. I'm honored to place in the top ten in the House for accessibility. Great report by @townhallproject! https://t.co/pDJQP1S6EP,2020-01-14 16:56:55,Twitter Web App,23,120

Sexual assault and harassment have no place in our Armed Forces. Today I stood with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to demand justice for victims of assault in the military including a victim from OK as their case heads to the Supreme Court. https://t.co/2ZSuyCiNkq,2020-01-14 00:18:35,Twitter for iPhone,14,96

There’s a right and wrong way to keep a check on the Administration and make long-term national security decisions. Partisan politics is the wrong way. Using our constitutional authority to set clear &amp; strategic boundaries about how and when Armed Forces are used is the right way,2020-01-11 01:12:54,Twitter for iPhone,2,29
I want to see both parties work together to pass an updated Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF). The AUMF defines where and when Armed Forces can be used but the last time Congress passed an AUMF was in 2002. We must update to account for current security threats.,2020-01-11 01:12:54,Twitter for iPhone,5,26
As tensions with Iran escalate my priority is protecting the long-term security of Americans. That means ensuring the ability to respond to threats while preventing a reckless war and fulfilling Congress’s obligation to determine where Armed Forces are used.,2020-01-11 01:12:53,Twitter for iPhone,1,17
My vote this week on the War Powers Resolution was not a go-ahead for the President to engage in a military conflict. My vote was against a resolution more focused on partisan politics than the best interest of our national security.,2020-01-11 01:12:53,Twitter for iPhone,18,98
Our state has lost a champion for equality. Please join me in mourning the loss of a fellow Oklahoman Dustin Parker. Violence against transgender Americans is an epidemic that must be stopped.

PFAS are toxic man-made chemicals. They're often called "forever chemicals" because they persistent in the environment and accumulate in our bodies. PFAS are linked to cancer impaired child development and many other diseases. We must confront this urgent public health threat.,2020-01-10 00:22:05,Twitter Web App,2,26
More information on the Oklahoma sites which have tested positive for PFAS contamination is available here: https://t.co/nOnzfzxHso,2020-01-10 00:22:04,Twitter Web App,4,25
Access to clean water is a basic human right. Sadly four water sites in OKC alone have tested positive for PFAS chemicals. This week in the House we're taking up legislation to clean up contamination protect public health and stop more PFAS chemicals from entering our water. https://t.co/uBFSGkHWI3,2020-01-10 00:22:04,Twitter Web App,28,143

The American public deserves to know what comes next. Looking forward we need a plan from the President and assurance that this Administration is taking every precaution to avoid a reckless war that puts American citizens and service members in harm’s way.,2020-01-07 18:03:01,Twitter Web App,1,70
There’s no question that Soleimani was a threat to the U.S. and that he was responsible for the death of hundreds of Americans. But are Americans safer now than before Soleimani was killed? Our military decisions should be deliberate and targeted at increasing long-term security.,2020-01-07 18:03:01,Twitter Web App,8,84
As tensions with Iran escalate protecting the safety and security of the American people has to come first. The President must work with Congress on a strategy that manages risk to American citizens and avoids another reckless war in the Middle East.,2020-01-07 18:03:00,Twitter Web App,20,233

This spike in drug costs is forcing hardworking Americans to choose between putting food on the table and affording life-saving medications. It's time for the Senate to take up the Lower Drug Costs Now Act which the House passed with bipartisan support! https://t.co/9WFUvuzrRS,2020-01-03 14:16:46,Twitter Web App,61,229

I did not come to Congress seeking impeachment nor do I agree with the extreme voices on either side. But we must act to protect our Constitution the integrity of our elections and our national security.,2019-12-17 19:18:32,Twitter Web App,155,1533
Inviting foreign interference in our elections strikes at the heart of our democracy threatens our security and is an abuse of power. The President obstructed Congress by withholding evidence refusing to comply with lawful subpoenas and prohibiting officials from testifying.,2019-12-17 19:18:32,Twitter Web App,165,1452
It's with a heavy heart but with clarity of conviction that I have made my decision. The oath I took to protect and defend the Constitution requires a vote for impeachment. The articles before us allege an abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The facts substantiate both. https://t.co/57LtDQAhm8,2019-12-17 19:18:32,Twitter Web App,1638,13044
Great to be at @kfor @koconews  @NEWS9 and @OKCFOX talking about everything we’re getting done in Washington for Oklahomans - the NDAA the USMCA and working to lower prescription drug prices. https://t.co/A07ko3diIY,2019-12-13 23:19:35,Twitter for iPhone,34,233
We just passed the Reduce Drug Prices Now Act! That includes my bill to cap out-of-pocket costs for millions of seniors. HR3 also reduces the cost of life-saving drugs like insulin. Drug costs are out of control we must act. Time for the Senate to pass HR3! #GettingItDoneForOK,2019-12-12 22:00:19,Twitter for iPhone,57,378
Last night the NDAA passed the House in an overwhelming bipartisan vote: 377 to 48. The bill includes our Tenants Bill of Rights with housing protections for our military families.

On National Julius Jones Petition Day I stand with OKC's community &amp; faith leaders calling on our Governor to consider Julius's petition for clemency.

Today's bill includes a 3.1% raise for service members - the largest increase in a decade - also 12 weeks of paid parental leave and repeal of the widow's tax. Compromise takes hard work but this year’s #NDAA is proof that it pays off.,2019-12-10 02:42:46,Twitter for iPhone,11,81
Today I signed a bipartisan deal to finish negotiations over the #NDAA. The final bill includes a Tenants Bill of Rights to protect our military families from unsafe housing conditions.

The housing conditions our service members and military families have been asked to put up with are unacceptable. Today I questioned the contractor who failed to maintain housing at Tinker.

#OK5 is home to so many federal employees from workers at Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center to those at Tinker.  Public servants play a critical role in national defense &amp; suffer during shutdowns. They deserve a Congress that does its job and funds the government. #NoBudgetNoPay,2019-12-04 00:32:47,Twitter Web App,8,60
Today I co-sponsored the No Budget No Pay Act - the idea is simple: if Congress doesn't meet deadlines for budget and funding bills then members don't get paid. It's time for Congress to stop kicking the can down the road and meet it's constitutional responsibilities. https://t.co/JCgTBFoKxi,2019-12-04 00:30:59,Twitter Web App,82,337

Is this bill perfect? No. But overall this legislation improves how our country performs its most critical work. #HR1 (14/14),2019-03-08 01:25:06,TweetDeck,5,24
The bill would create nonpartisan independent commissions for each state. You’re supposed to choose us not the other way around. We shouldn’t let politicians pick and choose which voters get to elect them. #HR1 (13/),2019-03-08 01:23:52,TweetDeck,13,50
We want to make sure that your voice is just as important as anyone else’s regardless of how much or how little you have. #HR1 (12/),2019-03-08 01:23:07,TweetDeck,4,17
This bill would make sure that you can know who is paying for ads you see on TV or Facebook or Twitter. That Is often a secret now! This would keep foreign-controlled companies from making large donations. #HR1 (11/),2019-03-08 01:22:33,TweetDeck,6,23
I don’t see that requirement as a burden. I’m happy to disclose our donors and expenditures. Dark money groups don’t have to tell you where they got their money who gave it to them or how they spent it. They shouldn’t get special protections. #HR1 (10/),2019-03-08 01:21:53,TweetDeck,4,19
I have heard it all across my district: We need to change how Washington works. Outside groups spend billions of dollars to sway policy here. And although members of congress have to disclose every dollar that flows into our campaign accounts outside groups don’t. #HR1 (9/),2019-03-08 01:21:21,TweetDeck,4,20
The bill authorizes $1 billion to help states strengthen their security systems. Is that a lot of money? Yes. But again election access and security are key to our democracy. #HR1 (8/),2019-03-08 01:20:31,TweetDeck,4,17
We must also ensure our voting systems are secure. Although OK's voter access could improve our system sets an example for the rest of the country. It is consistent statewide uses easy-to-read paper ballots and machines that have never been connected to the internet. #HR1 (7/),2019-03-08 01:19:46,TweetDeck,4,21
Voting limitations like these disproportionately affect our minority communities. Our nation has a long history of disenfranchising people of color. The Voting Rights Act helped address that but there is still work to do. #HR1 (6/),2019-03-08 01:18:16,TweetDeck,4,17
Our laws create unnecessary burdens. In OK we require a notary on all absentee ballots. Our state has no history of absentee ballot fraud. In other states punishments don’t fit crimes; laws revoke the right to vote even after sentences are completed. #HR1 (5/),2019-03-08 01:16:59,TweetDeck,5,20
I just got back from the Congressional Civil Rights Pilgrimage where we toured some of the most pivotal sites in our nation’s civil rights history. People there died for their right to vote but there are still Americans who lack this access. #HR1 (4/),2019-03-08 01:14:08,TweetDeck,4,16
Here is a highlight of what I think is most important. It makes registering to vote easier. It ensures our elections are more secure. It shines a light on outside groups and their money in Washington. And it ensures you pick us not the other way around. #HR1 (3/),2019-03-08 01:13:26,TweetDeck,5,17
There is literally nothing more important that we can and should do than ensuring our democracy is protected. The foundation of everything we do – national security education everything – is our democratic system. We have to make sure every single citizen has a voice. #HR1 (2/),2019-03-08 01:12:06,TweetDeck,6,20
Y’all have probably seen a lot about #HR1 also known as the For the People Act of 2019. It’s a big bill with a lot of things in it. I’m supporting it. Here is a thread about why. (1/),2019-03-08 01:11:31,TweetDeck,28,101
